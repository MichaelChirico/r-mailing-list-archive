Subject: [R] zero-offset matrices
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.96.990302120856.28165D-100000@laplace>

Has anyone written subscripting methods for matrices which are indexed
from zero? i.e. functions such as "[.zoffset" and "[<-.zoffset" which
would allow, given an appropriate function "zmatrix"

"zmatrix" <- function(...)
{
	robj <- matrix(...)
	class(robj) <- "zoffset"
	robj
}

fred <- zmatrix(1:20, 4, 5)
fred[0, 4]		# would be 17
fred[3, ] <- NA		# would set the last row to NA

Many thanks, Jonathan.

Message-ID: <36DBF6F9.BFB3454F@aicos.com>

I have downloaded rw0632 (Windows Version) from the CRAN at ETH Zuerich.
Im working with NT4.0 Service Pack 4. I can start without any problems
the GUI program Rgui.exe.

But by using Rterm.exe (batch mode or with ESS respectivelly) I always
get an error "the instruction at "0x10018ee8" referenced memory at
""......."

Any ideas what is wrong?

No, but should it not be very easy? Just check if the subscript is
numeric, add 1, call NextMethod? Let's see:

"[.zoffset"  <- function(x, i, j, drop=F)
{
  if(!missing(i) && is.numeric(i)) i <- i+1
  if(!missing(j) && is.numeric(j)) j <- j+1
  NextMethod("[")
}
works.  But

"[<-.zoffset"  <- function(x, i, j, value)
{
  if(!missing(i) && is.numeric(i)) i <- i+1
  if(!missing(j) && is.numeric(j)) j <- j+1
  NextMethod("[<-")
}
works in S but not in R. (Which I think is a bug.) I next tried

"[<-.zoffset"  <- function(x, i, j, value)
{
  Call <- match.call()
  if(!missing(i) && is.numeric(i)) Call$i <- i+1
  if(!missing(j) && is.numeric(j)) Call$j <- j+1
  Call$x <- unclass(Call$x)
  Call[[1]] <- as.name("[<-")
  structure(eval(Call), class=class(x))
}

which works only if x and y are not missing, as "[<-"(x=x, i=i,
value=value) does not do what I expected (it takes j=1). You need
"[<-"(x=x, i=i, j=, value=value) and I could not construct that in R
easily. So I resorted to doing this by hand:

"[<-.zoffset"  <- function(x, i, j, value)
{
  if(!missing(i) && is.numeric(i)) i <- i+1
  if(!missing(j) && is.numeric(j)) j <- j+1
  y <- unclass(x)
  if(missing(i)) {
    if(missing(j)) y[] <- value else y[, j] <- value
  } else {
    if(missing(j)) y[i,] <- value else y[i, j] <- value
  }
  structure(y, class=class(x))
}

So perhaps someone who really understands R will tell me what is going on here.

  Mark,
  I can't reproduce the error here. But, can you try to
  execute rterm giving the entire path (c:\...\rw0632\bin\Rterm.exe)
  and see if this resolve the problem. Motivation: after the
  release of rw0632 we discovered that the way 
  RHOME (i.e, c:\...\rw0632) used to be 'computed' fails on some 
  but this can be resolved (for the moment) passing the entire path.
  BTW, this problem has been fixed by Brian Ripley for the forthcoming
  0.63.3.

I have been bitten by this bug, too. You have to launch Rterm with the full
path name.

I have had a similar experience!  I am not sure what is going on either,
but I have a working solution as follows ...

"[.zoffset" <-
function (x, i = rep(T, nrow(x)), j = rep(T, ncol(x)), ...) 
{
    x <- unclass(x)
    if (!is.logical(i)) {
        tmp <- rep(F, nrow(x))
        tmp[i + 1] <- T
        i <- tmp
    }
    if (!is.logical(j)) {
        tmp <- rep(F, ncol(x))
        tmp[j + 1] <- T
        j <- tmp
    }
    x[i, j, ...]
}

"[<-.zoffset" <-
function (x, i = rep(T, nrow(x)), j = rep(T, ncol(x)), value) 
{
    x <- unclass(x)
    if (!is.logical(i)) {
        tmp <- rep(F, nrow(x))
        tmp[i + 1] <- T
        i <- tmp
    }
    if (!is.logical(j)) {
        tmp <- rep(F, ncol(x))
        tmp[j + 1] <- T
        j <- tmp
    }
    x[i, j] <- value
    structure(x, class = "zoffset")
}

It is a bit clumsy, but it handles all the usual subscripting cases,
including things like

fred[, 0:2] <- NA

Cheers, Jonathan.

Yup, there's a bug in there somewhere, MatrixAssign ends up getting
called with the symbol "value" where the actual replacement value
should have been.

Of course, the whole point becomes a bit moot when one considers
*removing* rows and columns from a matrix...

To tickle the bug:

"[<-.zoffset"  <- function(x, i, j, value)
{
  if(!missing(i) && is.numeric(i)) i <- i+1
  if(!missing(j) && is.numeric(j)) j <- j+1
  NextMethod("[<-")
}
m<-matrix(1:4,2,2)
m[0,]<-4:5

Probably, set a breakpoint in do_subassigne and step through it.

Subject: [R] Can't understand error message :-{
Message-ID: <XFMail.990302101003.s-luppescu@uchicago.edu>

I'm sorry if this is a basic question, but I'm stumped. I'm just trying to plot
the residuals from a linear model against another variable in the data frame.
Here are the lines I'm trying to execute:

size <- read.table(file="/u67/abasl70/surveys/annenberg/mega/smschl.dat",
header=T)
sizef <- data.frame(size, row.names=size$unit)
attach(sizef)
mschmod <- lm (mavgres ~ crimesch + socstat + povnojob + ploinc94 + aa94 +
hisp94 + minty94 + mixed94, data=sizef)
plot(mschmod$residuals ~ size94)

The last line gives this error message:
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras,
extranames,  : variable lengths differ

In fact, the lengths are different:
> length(mschmod$residuals)
[1] 379
> length(size94)
[1] 384

but I'm sure I don't know 1) how this happened since it all came from the same
data frame, or 2) why it should prevent me from plotting the data. If someone
can tell me how to fix this (before I have to present the results at this
Thursday's meeting!) I'd be very appreciative.

	    y
}

You might prefer to call your new class "zmatrix", since this matches the
function that creates it, and you will probably want to define "zvector"
as well.

The idea that subscripts start from 1 in R is pretty fundamental, and you
may be entering a world of pain by messing with it.

YMMV

(1) Missing values in response and/or regressors cause cases to be
    discarded. 
(2) Plotting which of the y's against which x's ?

plot(mschmod$residuals ~ size94[complete.cases(mavgres,crimesch,
socstat,povnojob,ploinc94,aa94,hisp94,minty94,mixed94)])

should do the trick. Or, simpler but sneakier:

attach(sizef[rownames(mschmod$model),])
plot(residuals(mschmod) ~ size94)
detach()

It should also work with:

evalq(plot(residuals(mschmod) ~ size94), sizef[rownames(mschmod$model),])

(none of the above is tested, since I don't have your data of course)

Subject: [R] memory tricks
Message-ID: <199903021656.JAA12740@ale.atd.ucar.edu>

Perhaps I've missed this in the FAQ, but has someone documented any tricks
which can be used in R to optimize memory usage/execution time?  For S+,
StatSci used to recommend:
1. Avoid "for" loops whenever possible.
2. In "for" loops, have a simple expression, such as TRUE, as the last 
statement.
3. Allocate memory for a vector/array at one time, rather than building it
up in a "for" loop using c(), rbind(), etc.
4. Execute code which manipulates large objects within a function, rather
than directly from the command line.

Should these practices help when using R?  Are there others which users 
should know about?

Thanks...Steve Oncley

Subject: [R] DLL's and WINAPI
Message-ID: <0F7Z001OTWVHZD@hermes.ucd.ie>

The reason i had problems running C++ DLL's in R was that i had 
defined my functions using the WINAPI command, e.g. 

void __export WINAPI  fname ( int x[10][2], int y[10] ) 
{
....
....
}

I thought i could use WINAPI so that the name of the function 
("fname") would remain unchanged when called in R which it does, 
but it also implements the standard calling convention, (as 
opposed to the C calling convention) which was the source of my 
problems.
Also my dll's weren't portable because I had dynamically linked in 
some libraries.

Sorry to bother everyone with such a basic question again, but I can't seem to
set my axis labels. When I use
title(ylab="String")
"String" just overwrites the variable name, producing a mess. When I try to put
ylab="String" in the plot function, like this:

plot(residuals(mschmod) ~ size94, ylab = "Productivity Adjusted for Context")
I get this message:
Error: formal argument "ylab" matched by multiple actual arguments

Thanks for the help (again).

Subject: [R] How to set axis labels?
Message-ID: <199903021945.IAA23455@stat1.stat.auckland.ac.nz>

Some of the functions don't seem to allow plot labels to be overridden
In the case of plot.lm you can redefine it as follows:

"plot.lm" <-
function (x, xlab = "Fitted values", ylab = "Residuals",
          main = paste("Tukey-Anscombe plot of", deparse(x$call)), ...)
{
    if (!any(class(x) == "lm"))
        stop("Use only with 'lm' objects")
    r <- residuals(x)
    yh <- fitted(x)
    hii <- lm.influence(x)$hat
    if (prod(par("mfcol")) < 2 && interactive()) {
        op <- par(ask = TRUE)
        on.exit(par(op))
    }
    plot(yh, r, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, main = main, ...)     
    abline(h = 0, lty = 3, col = "gray")
    qqnorm(r/sqrt(1 - hii), ylab = "Standardized Residuals")
}   

Note that this only changes the labels residuals vs y-hat plot,
not in the normal plot.

One of the nice features of this kind of software is that you can
modify the default functions to meet your own needs.

I am using r0.63.2 for Windows.

This seems like it should be a FAQ but I couldn't find it in the R FAQ.
If I want to have different workspaces for different projects how do I
arrange for R to restore a workspace from a directory other than the one
where the executable is, automatically on startup? Is it possible, or do I
have to save the workspace in the right directory then manually restore it
from there?

A good place to start would be "Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, with Julie Sussman
(cited by Ross in his "R: Past and future history" paper, which you can
find on CRAN).  This is an introduction to computing using Scheme, one
of the languages on which R is based.  You can review the first chapter,
which is in fact quite a large chunk of the book, online

First, if you were doing this on Unix/GNU-Linux or using rterm.exe, it
would be automatic, hence the absence from the FAQ.  R uses the copy of
.RData found in its starting directory, and I believe the problem relates
to how you are starting R under Windows. (I guess you must be
double-clicking Rgui.exe in Explorer.)

We advise you to make a shortcut to Rgui.exe in your project directory, and
alter its properties to give the project directory as the `Start in'
directory.  Then when you run that shortcut it loads .Rdata from that
directory, and when you finish it saves to that directory (unless you
navigate the file system using the menu dialog boxes inside R: we have
fixed that for rw0633).  All file paths will be relative to the `Start in'
directory: this is standard Windows behaviour (except that there is
probably no such thing).

If you want to load a workspace from or save to another directory you can
use load.image("somewhere/.RData") or save.image("somewhere/.RData").
You can also do this from the File menu, but beware of the .rda extensions.

I realize this information is not where it probably should be, in a FAQ in
the Windows distribution. We are working hard on documenting the Windows
version of R, but please bear in mind that as I in particular do not use R
for teaching, it is hard to know what are the problems that stem from a
lack of Windows sophistication rather than R problems. Ideas for that
R-for-Windows FAQ will be gratefully received (but to me, not R-help,
please).

I have put up a pretest version of rw0633 at

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/rw0633pre.zip

that appears to work from all the shells we can try, even Cygwin bash.
It has a lot of other fixes, including to system() and the way file
dialogs affect the working directory.


Those who have had problems are welcome to try it. Be aware that it is
based on the current R-release, and

o  you should use --vsize 10M not 10 

o  workspaces are saved in XDR format, so rw0632 cannot read those
   saved in this version, but this can read those saved in rw0632 and those
   saved on a Unix version of R.  If you get caught, use save(,ascii=T)
   to save objects in ASCII format.
   
o  The rw-FAQ and other documentation are missing.
   
As this is a pre-release of beta software, do take suitable care with using it.

you may like to consider pstoedit for that purpose. It has many useful

I'm afraid that you'd have to write one... It shouldn't be all that
difficult to model something on the PicTex driver by changing the TeX
commands into the Fig-format file entries, but it isn't an afternoons
work either.  And, as someone already said, you my want to try
pstoedit first.

Older version of GS certainly do cause trouble. I haven't seen it with
the newer versions (yet?).

I guess that your problem is caused because you forget to close the
"postscript graphics device" after doing something like:

An xfig driver is on my todo list.  It's needed a good polygon clipping
algorithm.  I have that now, and am working toward the driver (via
enhanced persp and contour functions and a map drawing library).

  I don't know of an xfig driver, although I don't keep up with the latest
versions.  One solution that (sort of) works is to get ahold of pstoedit,
which can convert relatively straightforward PostScript into xfig format
(although you usually have to tweak the positions of text, etc. a little
bit).

  I have only had problems using ghostscript from within xdvi (probably
because of PostScript Level 1/2 incompatibilities); this was briefly
discussed on R-devel a while back.

  [ If we did have an xfig driver, it would be neat to have R
automatically spawn an xfig process and put the graphics right into it
...]

The problems of plotting residuals vs fitted data/covariates where there
are NAs caught me out a little while ago.  Would it not be better if the
fitting functions lm, glm etc and plot were consistent?  Thus either (a)
plot() omitted cases in the X or the Y which were NA before checking for
length consistency or (b) residuals() etc included NA in the appropriate
places. 

Another consequence of the present inconsistency is that, it *is* possible
that the vector contraction just happens to return a vector of the same
length.  This happened to me without realising it for a time - I had 625
items and took a subset of 620 but, through ignorance of the correct
commands and a good measure of stupidity, it was the wrong subset! 
Fortunately I checked and from the plots it was obvious that something was
wrong but it makes me rather nervous when handling big data sets.  Mea
culpa I know but it is an easy trap to fall into. 

Where there are lots of NA's and lots of subsets of data, I also find
myself making too many similar copies of data to avoid very long plot() 
commands then forgetting which is which.  Another case for an extended
form of ls() (ls-l maybe) as recently suggested which includes the
structure size and perhaps class etc.

(a) won't work if you think closer about it. (b) might. I wouldn't be
surprised if there's a rationale for the way things are now, but I
can't seem to reconstruct it. Well, there's space saving of course,
but given the waste in other areas, that is hardly a crucial point.
Possibly, consistent behaviour of drop(), etc. has something to do
with it.

I hope that (b) does work, as that is the direction S-PLUS is taking,
prompted by passionate advocacy from Terry Therneau whose survival code
does this. But, you do have to be very careful: you are implicitly assuming
(as does Terry, explicitly) that na.action=na.omit. That is by no means the
only possibility (not even the default), and na.action could also increase
the number of cases (multiple imputation).  It isn't just residuals: the
issue over predict is subtler, and you may want to handle fitted, residuals
and predict separately. And when you start doing this you may break a lot
of code.

The best way to avoid trouble is to use the row names/vector names, which
tell you which of the original cases you have. Now they are passed down
correctly in R (I hope) you can just match the sets of names. (What, I
hear, you want the software to do that? Oh well, one day, for some plot
methods.)

Werner Stahel (in our stat group) has been using hacked versions of  lm
and some hacked lm methods which exactly address this,
i.e. they follow the "b)"  approach;  however I think that it's still a
hack that only works in some (most used) cases.
One would have to change quite a few  lm/glm/... methods probably.

I do think it'd be a worthwhile route, though incompatible with S.

Would one want to have a global option() to toggle this behavior?
It looks dangerous and undesirable (a la octave ..) to have functions
return different results depending on options().
The "contrasts" case is a half step in that direction, and it has had all
kind of adverse consequences.  
Ideally, options() should only affect the way results are *displayed*, 
not the way they are computed (and stored). 

Other opinions?

Subject: [R] seg fault
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990305155422.2347E-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

sorry for the confusion I caused regarding the subject "segmentation
fault". The corrections that made it to the list were corrections of a
mail that bounced (because of its lengths). I included too much data
because I thought that my problem was connected with the exact
distribution of it. This does not seem to be the case as I found out with
some help from Martin.

Well, the problem is that I get a segmentation fault calling loess. It
seems to be a problem of the lengths of the variables included in loess. 
Is there an upper limit of points that can be treated using loess? It
seems so (see the example at the end). 

More generally, is there a way to find out what actually caused a
segmentation fault?

Regards, Lorenz

example:

library ("modreg")
n <- 1000
while (TRUE) {
  cat (n, "\n")
  .Random.seed <- 0:3
  x <- runif(n)
  y <- 3 + 4*x + rnorm(n)/10

  loess(y ~ x, span= 1)
  n <<- n+500
}

1000 
1500 
2000 
2500 
3000 
3500

Returning a result parallel to the inputs has always seemed like
a no-brainer to me.  IIRC, it didn't work in the Old-S 'reg'
functions, but the New-S 'lsfit' function added that behavior.
Then August92-S (isn't that what we called it?) inexplicably
broke it again in all the new object-oriented modeling
functions.

I agree that options() is the wrong place to specify this sort
of thing.  Couldn't the desired behavior could be obtained by
adding a "na.fill" argument to each modeling method (defaulted
to FALSE for S compatibility)?

Now, should the NAs also be inserted into the model.frame?

Lorenz, I've used your example code, somewhat ``improved'' by diagnostic
printing.

    library ("modreg")
    .Random.seed <- 0:3
    n <- 500

    while (TRUE) {
	cat("\nn=", n, ":")
	x <- runif(n)
	y <- 3 + 4*x + rnorm(n)/10

	cat(" time:", unix.time(loess(y ~ x, span= 1)),"\n")
	cat(" gc() free:"); print(as.vector(gc()[,"free"]))
	n <<- n+500
    }

For me, it ends as

    ............

    4500  time: 78.2 0.02 141 0 0 
     gc() free:Ncells Vcells 
     83129 213516 


    5000  time: 96.8 0 174 0 0 
     gc() free:Ncells Vcells 
     83129 212516 


    5500 Error: heap memory (2048 Kb) exhausted [needed 85 Kb more]
	   See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.
    Timing stopped at: 116.42 0.02 210 0 0 
    Execution halted


Problems are:  

	 1) loess() does allocate memory dynamically in 
	    ``not so standard'' ways, namely using standard C's Calloc(.)
	      --> see loess_workspace(.) in src/library/modreg/src/loessc.c
	    instead of R's  C_alloc() function [from src/main/memory.c]
	    (yes yes, if this API would have been documented, Brian would
	     have used it when writing loessc.c for the modreg package..)

	     and hence gc() does not really show how much memory is used..

	 However the error message above clearly leads you in the right
	 direction, namely  ?Memory  (see below).

	 2) loessf.f (same directory) is really the heart of the algorithm,

	    However it is (modified) output of  ratfor or
	    something like it, and not really well documented;
            Tons of  ehg1<nm> routines which have no helpful names, 
	    and unfortunately don't have too many comments....


Solution for you:
--------

Give more vector memory to R :

In  R versions <= 0.63.2, use  e.g.,

    R --vsize 10  

(uses 10 MBytes of vector heap memory).

>From the just released version 0.63.3 on, the syntax is

     R --vsize 10M

(idea behind: Both "nsize" and "vsize" are given in single units;
      Bytes for vsize  and  "Cons Cells" (= 4 Bytes)  for  nsize)

I've just downloaded the version dated "Mar 5, 1999", and it works globally
fine.
I'm running it on NT4, SP3.

The Rterm can be started from DOS box or from Explorer with no problems. If
somebody cares to know, it can also be started from the MKS Toolkit Korn
shell.

The system() command works as expected.

Graphics printing and copying to clipboard as bitmap work OK.

Some very minor problems or things that would be nice to have:

Copying graphics as metafile and saving it as metafile seems to be broken -
I get an empty image when I try to paste or insert in Word97. Saving as GIF
works OK.

The File menu "Change dir" pops a message box "Change working directory to
?" with "Yes" and "No" buttons, and clicking on any of the two doesn't seem
to do anything.

The "Buffered output" on Misc menu operates as toggle; it would be nice to
have a check mark in front of it when activated.

In conclusion, I'm very happy with this new version.

It works: please wait for the documentation of what it does.

This is a problem in a package: could you refer those to the package porter
(here Jim Lindsey) please. I will only update the binary versions for
rw0xx when the version on CRAN is updated (or if something is seriously
wrong).

Subject: [R] seg fault: some more comments
In-Reply-To: <199903051654.RAA28883@sophie.ethz.ch>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990307132114.248C-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

Thanks for the recent comments on my segmentation fault problem when using
loess.

I realized that I should have mentioned two things. Firstly, I am already
working with R --vsize 100 and still get a crash at n= 4000. Secondly I am
using R 0.63.1 with a SuSE Linux 5.2

Obviously one thing to do is to upgrade (neither in Martin Maechlers nor
in Brian Ripleys attempts there is an actual seg fault but only an error).

A further observation that I made is that loess's performence seems to
deteriorate if called several times in succession even if gc () is called
in between. (Which might make sense in the view of what the problem might
be regarding memory allocation?)

What I currently did is just use a random sample of my data of acceptale
size (to loess) to actually calculate loess and quit and restart R if I
needed loess several times in succession. This may not be very pretty but
I got what I needed and running the commands in batch mode with a shell
scripts does make it pretty simple, too. (Just a side comment, why is
.lib.loc different in batch than in interactive mode?) 

Regards, Lorenz

Ah, I think that is the point: you were using 0.63.1 and we were using
0.63.2 or 0.63.3.  You may find that loess uses less memory in 0.63.3
as I have fixed a bug that unnecessarily allocated quite a large array.
(But this is additional memory, not R-managed memory.)

Try it again with 0.63.3 (and with something as recent as loess in R, you
do want to keep up to date).

Subject: [R] coplot has me stumped
Message-ID: <XFMail.990307121207.s-luppescu@uchicago.edu>

I'm having trouble with coplot. I have two conditioning variables, and when I
try to specify two sets of given.values, no matter what I do I get the message,
Error: Object "b.levels" not found.

Here is the section of code:
c.ranges <- co.intervals(schses, number=4, overlap=0)
a.ranges <- co.intervals(as.factor(aa94), number=2, overlap=0)
PredAA <- as.factor(aa94)
coplot(Adj.Math.Productivity ~ size94|schses * PredAA, panel=points.lines,
given.values=list(c.ranges, a.ranges ), rows=2, columns=4 )

Instead of 'a.ranges' in the coplot statement, I have also tried c(0,1), and
lots of other variations, but no matter what I do, I always get the same
message. There must be something fundamental I'm missing, but what is it?

I'm using R version 0.63.2 on Linux (intel). I tried to find 0.63.3, but it
doesn't seem to have shown up on the ftp sites yet. Thanks for your help.

Subject: [R] ANOVA f-test
Message-ID: <19990307102533.B8181@toocool.itslab.calpoly.edu>

I have a rather basic question.  How can I get R to generate a ANOVA table
and a f-value for a hypothesis test such as:

Data: group1 values: 5.2 4.5 6.0 6.1 6.7 5.8
      group2 values: 6.5 8.0 6.1 7.5 5.9 5.6
      ...

H0: mean1 = mean2 = mean3 = mean4
HA: at least two means different

where I want to evaluate using a f test statistic?
F = MSTr/MSE

I'd like a table similar to one that Minitab would produce:

        Df	 Sum Sq   Mean Sq   F value
mean1
mean2
mean3
Error

Secondly, how can do a second evaluation using a multiple ANOVA compare using
Tukey's procedure?

Thanks

BK

What are these: the means of four groups, two of which are shown?

(I don't see MS_Tr in _that_ table.)

Try using aov(response ~ grouping, data=) and its summary method for the
conventional analysis. If you have a four-group one-way layout I have no
idea what the `MINITAB' table means statistically (nor do I recognize it
from my long-ago usage of MINITAB): each mean only has a meaningful line
when you know what else has been fitted, and one should be looking at
contrasts.  You can get something like this by mis-using anova.lm.

Eh?  That could mean several things. If you mean Tukey's method of multiple
comparisons, it is not currently available in R. (It is in recent versions
of S-PLUS.)  [John Tukey is one of the most prolific of statisticians ever:
"Tukey's procedure" is not at all precise.]

To be fair, once we're talking multiple comparisons, there's hardly
more than one. We don't have the procedure as such, but we do have the
studentised range distribution which is at the core of it (ptukey and
qtukey) for equal sized groups (and I don't really trust it for
anything else). Once one has the basic understanding of the ANOVA
tables output, it should be fairly easy to apply it.

Subject: [R] passing parameters by reference?
Message-ID: <Pine.SUN.3.95.990307173728.13182A-100000@paca>


  I was translating some code from C to R and found that I would really
like to be able to pass some parameters to an R function by reference
(i.e., have the function make changes in the variables that then propagate
back to the calling environment).
  I have some vague knowledge of the whole assign(substitute(deparse()))
framework, but I was just wondering if there is some simpler/more accepted
idiom ...

  To make this concrete, suppose I want to write a swap() function that
swaps the values of two variables:

swap <- function(a,b) {
   tmp <- a; a <- b; b <- tmp
}

  clearly doesn't work.
  Is there something simple and bulletproof that would work?

  (Just a little more context: I'm translating some Numerical Recipes
optimization code to R for a class I'm teaching.  I could do it with a
call to C code, but I'd like the students to be able to play around with
the code easily.  For the time being I've worked around this problem, but 
it left me wondering.)

 thanks,

Sorry, I was refering to his (Tukey's) method of multiple comparisons based on
the studentised range distribution.  The data I'm dealing with are equally
sized samples.

People write whole books about this, and I think Tukey has at least
two procedures. S-PLUS manages to find about 8, as does Yandell's book. If
I had thought it was that easy I would have added it to aov, but I didn't
and still don't. Even specifying which comparisons are to be considered
is non-trivial, I believe.

Hello,

Does anyone know where I might BEGIN to look for the reason why the
documentation for R doesn't 'produced' properly on my linux machines?  The
binary is made and seems to run (the demos work), but I don't get any help
pages (ie I get nothing when I type ?contributors).  If I repeatedly run
the 'build-help' command in the bin directory, it will take up where it
broke the last time, and make the html and latex files, and create the
help files, but they are only two bytes long.  After a while I get a
broken pipe message and it stops.  I just changed to a newer version of
perl 5 but it still doesn't work.  What else could be broken?

Actually I did remember to dev.off().  I'm inserting the graphic into a LaTeX
document and then using gs to print it.  What happens is that gs processes
most of the document and then spits out an error just before it finishes.

I can actually print the partial file it creates by running gs manually and
directing the output file to the printer device.  The problem is that I
normally send the document (as postscript from dvips) through lp which
automagically runs gs (Solaris print filter system) and directs that to the
device.  Of course an error code from gs causes the filtering to abort and I
get no output.

Hmm. What was the error code and what were you trying to print? (I.e.
can you boil it down to a file of a manageable size?)

Here's a regression plot that I wanted to put in a document.  Aladdin
Ghostscript 4.03 and 5.10 both choke on it.  I would attach this stuff, but I
don't really like MIME.

Subject: [R] R installaiton help
Message-ID: <199903081936.OAA26409@dark.brown.edu>

Hello,

I have been trying to install R on a Sun box running Solaris 2.6. I am
running into a strange error when trying to make R. Basically, everything
compiles fine, but it stops when trying to "make doc". Here's the output of
the compiler:

>Building system startup profile
>You should `make docs' now ...
>make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `*/man/*.Rd'
>Current working directory /home/diwang/download/R-0.63.2/src/library

I looked at the makefile instead /src/library, and found the following
lines that's being called:

stamp-docs: $(srcdir)/*/man/*.Rd $(top_builddir)/library/LibIndex
        @rm -f $@ stamp-help stamp-html stamp-latex stamp-examples
        @echo "Building ALL documentation (help, HTML, LaTeX, R- Examples)"
        @$(MAKE) DOCS
        @touch $@ stamp-help stamp-html stamp-latex stamp-examples

So Make utility is looking for the target $(srcdir)/*/man/*.Rd, which it
cannot find. I know the .Rd files are there, but the Makefile lacks target
for compiling them. So I am wondering how can I rectify this.


Thank you very much,

It will work if you use gnumake (or whatever the GNU make utility is 
called on your system).

And provided that is not GNU-make 3.77! As the INSTALL file says:

To compile R, you currently most likely need GNU make.  (To be more
precise, you need a version of make which accepts shell wildcards in
dependencies.)  On Solaris 2.6 in particular, you need a version of
GNU make different from 3.77 (the current one); 3.76.1 works fine.

If this is problem I can let you make a patched version of gmake 3.77
for Solaris 2.6.

It usually helps to read the documentation (in R it may not take you very
long, sigh).

Hello,

I managed to solve the problem myself.  After fooling around with the
machine(s) last night I discovered that either my groff (1.09) is either
'broken' or too old.  This is on a 'homemade' linux machine and the groff
was from 1994.

After updating to groff 1.11 the docs came out just fine!!

Subject: [R] lm() using data frames
Message-ID: <B7F24F2B48ACD11196F600805FC7F430062A9B@pdc.rc.liv.ac.uk>

Under NT 4.0, using Version 0.63.2 Beta (Jan 12, 1999):

Not sure if this is a bug or a feature (forcing me to program less
clumsily) so I'll report it here rather than to bugs.

With a medium size data set (1700 observations,70 explanatory variables)
and plenty of memory, specifically

> gc()
          free   total
Ncells  886738 1000000
Vcells 7912909 8388608

I get a fatal error when attempting summary() on the fit of an lm() on a
large-ish set of dummy variables (stored in a matrix):

Call:
lm(formula = sasch2[, "ddiff"] ~ sasch2[, "td30"] + sasch2[,     "td60"]
+ sasch2[, "td90"] + sasch2[,  "td120"] + +sasch2[,     "td180"] +
sasch2[, "td240"] + sasch2[, "td300"] + sasch2[,     "td360"] +
sasch2[, "td420"] + sasch2[, "td480"] + sasch2[,     "db1"] + sasch2[,
"db1.5"] + sasch2[, "db2"] +  sasch2[, "db2.5"] +     +sasch2[, "db3.5"]
+ sasch2[, "db4"] + sasch2[, "db4.5"] +     sasch2[, "db5"] +  sasch2[,
"db5.5"] + +sasch2[, "db6"] +     sasch2[, "db6.5"] + sasch2[, "db7"] +
sasch2[, "db7.5"] +      sasch2[, "db8"] + +sasch2[, "db8.5"] + sasch2[,
"db9"] +     sasch2[, "db9.5"])

I get estimates OK, but summary() collapses. However, if I do the same
thing less clumsily, by writing all the relevant variables to a new data
frame, and then calling

Call:
lm(formula = ddiff ~ ., data = dtmp)

I get not only the estimates but can also summary() with no problem.

Any ideas why? Seems to be memory-linked, because I can lm() and
summary() the matrix versions using only the sasch2[,'td*'] or db*
variable sets.

Fatal errors are bugs and need to be reported (unless they involve
bugs in your own dyn.loaded code or very sleazy programming
techniques). Do you think that you can cook up an example showing this
behaviour, preferably using simulated data, so that we don't get
r-bugs clogged up with huge data sets? Would be nice to know whether
it also happens on Unix (and much easier to debug if it does).

(I smell a deparse()-length-limit rat or somesuch here...)

OK, the x and d got passed to the inner function.
And here it did not got passed to Surv(), I guess.

Is it solved in 0.63.3? Should I upgrade to 0.63.3? 
The problem is that I am in the middle of teaching a course
and 0.63.0 is the version we started with. 
Hate to tell them they all have to upgrade (many of them are
off line).

It would be better if there is a simple fix. (not upgrading) Thanks.

This is fixed in the version of the survival library on CRAN in the devel
subdirectory, which goes with 0.63.3.  I don't know if that version is in
any Windows release.

It would be possible to just give the students an edited version of the
interpreted code for survival4.  The change is that
	sys.parent() 
should be replaced with
	sys.frame(sys.parent())
wherever it occurs (it's in about three or four eval() statements)

This is an R/S incompatibility. I don't know if it qualifies as a bug -- I
think sys.frame(sys.parent()) is the preferred usage even in S.

It does not give me an error in R-0.63.3, but I _think_ the
problem is actually in the version of survival4 you have. This used to have
        m <- eval(m, sys.parent())
instead of
        m <- eval(m, sys.frame(sys.parent()))
in several places, for example in survfit.

Try patching survfit as above.  I would suggest you upgrade survival4
to 1.3-0 and that means upgrading to rw0632 at least. You can't upgrade
to R-0.63.3 on Windows NT for a few days yet: it not released (and
don't use the pretest in a class, pl..e..a..se.)

the example() function seems to have a bug.  Specifically commands such 
as
	example(layout)
fail, even though there is a layout example.   The problem seems to be 
that the example function tries to open (in this case) layout.show.R 
instead of layout.R.

I think this is because the example function is looking at the first 
column of the AnIndex file instead of the second column.  If one 
changes,
        file <- system.file(paste("R-ex", directory.sep, 
                                  AnIndex[2 * i], ".R", sep = ""), pkg = pkg, 

to

        file <- system.file(paste("R-ex", directory.sep, 
                                  AnIndex[2 * i+1], ".R", sep = ""), pkg = pkg, 

it seems to work for me. (Note the fix has [2 * i + 1])

This was discussed on another R list earlier today. We think the fix is 

            AnIndex <- scan(AnIndexF, what = c("c", "c"), quiet = TRUE,
			sep="\t")

as there are names in the index with spaces in that get this read
incorrectly. The Windows versions have had this fix for some time.

This only AFAIK applies to examples in the base package.

I asked about this a couple of times and got no response.  I would assume
that indeed you can't put on axis labels (x,y,z) or ticks or numerical
values with the ticks.

My solution was to use text() to add the labels and numbers by hand.

I also think I heard it mentioned that R or R was working on adding new
features to persp (like axis labels I guess).

A question to all you R-gurus:

Can R (or S-plus, for that matter) make efficient use
of multiple Intel Processors running under Linux (within 
the same PC, not over a net)? 
With the release of the new 2.2 kernel, this would seem 
a interesting and cost-efficient way of boosting the 
computational power of Intel/Linux platforms when using 
R (or S-plus).

Thanks for any wise words,

Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.19990310151408.007b4aa0@graylab.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I'm using R 63.2 on windows NT, when I use

> lines(x,y, lty=2)

it produces a dashed line between the first pair of points and then reverts
back to a solid line. It produces different colours perfectly ok, but it's
not really a solution when the plot needs to be printed on a black and
white printer. Has anyone got a fix?

Subject: [R] Fortran90
Message-ID: <36E691D5.942DEEAC@univie.ac.at>

Hi,

working with R, version 0.63.0, I was successful to dyn.load
fortran90 subroutines on a Solaris 2.6, as long as they are more or less
in conformity with f77.

It was not possible to work with statements like
REAL,DIMENSION(:)  :: d
or
x=SUM(y).

REAL,DIMENSION(1:10) :: d is possible.

We compiled R with f77.

Is it possible with real f90 routines or is is in any conflict with the
shared object concept or do we simply have to recompile R with f90? Are
any system libraries missed?

Thanks,

Bodo Ahrens

Thanks to Thomas Lumley and Prof Brian Ripley. I edited the survival4
package interpreted file, change wherever 
   sys.parent()            to 

   sys.frame(sys.parent()) .

It appears in more then 5 places though. There are a few places
other then eval() statements I also changed. (Will that have some ill
effect?)

A new bug.  In 0.63.0 (windows NT) and 0.63.2 (on the Rweb)

> pt(1.96,df=100)
[1] 0.9736105          #this is OK
> pt(1.96, df=100000000000000000000)
[1] 0.5                #clearly wrong

and for df=1000000 it took way too long to compute

same with the F-distribution function.

This occurs if you are using GNU make not under that name: it calls
make -w and the other make does not know about -w. (It heppens
to me on Solaris.) The fix is to MAKE=gmake in config.site and re-configure,
or as an environment variable, where gmake is whatever than GNU make is called.
I hope this is the right diagnosis!

R is not currently multithreaded or otherwise parallelised. Threading is
in the list of things that would be interesting to do sometime in the
distant future. It will be hard.

There are possibilities for parallelisation short of making R fully
threaded.  One more-or-less straightforward one would be to replace the
matrix operations with efficient parallel code. This wouldn't help a lot
since R doesn't spend that much time doing matrix operations.  Another
possibility would be to run the graphics drivers in parallel with the main
code. This wouldn't help much, either, unless you routinely draw
high-resolution images or overloaded scatterplots.

A third possibility, which would be more difficult but might actually gain
something is to thread the "findVarInFrame" search. I did some profiling
last year sometime and this was taking up 20% of the execution time on
the examples I looked at. Cutting this in half might actually be 
noticeable.

On the other hand, most of the problems I have where speed is an issue are
simulations or bootstrapping problems that scale almost perfectly by
running 1/n as many on each of n processors.  I have managed 190% CPU
utilisation by two copies of R on a dual Pentium Pro even under an older
Linux kernel.

S4 has a threaded version (which is what Splus 5.0 is based on).  It's
a bit broken, and definitely alpha-quality.  When it works, it's
rather nice in an SMP environment.

One thing I'm scheduled to try out is compiling R using the portland
group compilers (www.pgroup.com, I think?), which optimize for SMP and
parallel LAN environments.  These aren't free, but some people have
seen decent improvements with them.

I'm not sure that it'll help very much, though, unless a good deal of
changes are made in the configuration to use the right libraries (it's
also not high on my To-Do list right now -- ask again in a few
months).

best,

  I have tried a moment ago with rw0632 (Win95) the following lines:

  but I cannot reproduce what you describe. Can you send me more
  detail on your system (and, please, try the graphics demo,
  just 'demo(graphics)' <ret>, first plot should show dotted
  lines).

One problem is that R only provides double precision floating point
numbers. Also, I don't know if the calling standards for f90 code are the
same as f77; it may even depend on your compiler. The compiler should come
with some documentation about calling from other languages.

Thank you, Peter.

On rw0632 I get the effect if I paste those lines into the console, 
but not if I source the file containing them! On the forthcoming
rw0633 I can't make this misbehave. Looks as if it related to the
recording mechanism in Guido's devga device, and that he has solved it.

I note that the CRAN at .at land still refers to 0.63.2.  Is this just a

Does 0.63.3 live elsewhere?

And I note the new function kronecker - very useful but can it be applied
to non-numerics as in factors, data frames etc preserving  the class,

This was just a typo, I corrected it. If you go to the link "Official
releases" at the CRAN-homepage, you can find all versions.

My DSE library is available in the development area of CRAN and at my web site
<http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert>.  The library has a broad range of
multivariate ARIMA and state-space modelling tools (but not exp. smoothing and
it is a bit weak on the integration part of ARIMA models.) The documentation is
also all available at the web site, so you can get some idea if it does what you
want before you load it. If you are using a recent version of R please get DSE
from my web site, as the installation procedures in the version on CRAN are for
older versions of R.

Subject: [R] R 68.3 on OSF V4.0 problems
Message-ID: <199903120007.LAA07581@milan.maths.usyd.edu.au>

I am trying to install R-0.63.3 on a Digital Alpha running OSF V4.0D, and
having some difficulties. Can anyone help?

Also, I found some "oddities" in the installation process. I expect that
this message is read by the developers, maybe some of my suggestions can be
incorporated into future releases.

Please reply to me directly (as well as possibly also to this mailing list):
I am not a recipient of the list.


My problem is that floating-point operations seem weird. If I 'make' the
package as instructed, R quits (right after the welcome messages) with a
"floating exception"; if I change things so as not to use IEEE_754 (whatever
that means, and however 'configure' decided to use it), then the treatment
of 0/0 and the like (NaN, Inf) seems weird. Should not 'configure' pick the
correct options for my machine, and should not R recognize NaN and Inf?


The "oddities" of the build and installation process are:

Need cc (or ld?), not f77 for linking in src/main/Makefile (f77 has a nasty
habit of linking crt0.o or whatever).

Small bug in src/unix/Makefile causes needless re-makes.

Scripts COMPILE, INSTALL and SHLIB in src/scripts must use gmake, not the
DEC make (or I get the 'unknown option w' error).

The DEC shell /bin/sh has a weird (wrong?) treatment of "${@}", use ksh in
the main bin/R script.

For the installation, I like to keep things in the one directory, with
symlinks from /usr/local/bin and similar places. This allows easier
maintenance: I can build and install new versions as a non-root user. Root
does not need to run an "untrusted" makefile, but has only to create a few
symlinks. (I am root on my machines, but...)


Below is the shell script I used to build R so you can see exactly what I
done.


Thanks in advance for any help with my problem.

Well, if you explicitly tell it that it's not an IEEE system, don't
expect IEEE concepts like NaN and Inf to work. This can't be the right
solution. I believe someone else managed to get it past that floating
exception thing at some point? 

'Configure' is no more intelligent than the people who write the
scripts, it has some generic checks and searches that it can try, but
most systems need some last minor tweak to come out right. So on
systems where we have sparse information on what is needed to get
things to work, strange things happen.

Now who was it that got it to work?

Subject: [R] extension to outer()
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.96.990312101026.12487O-100000@laplace>

I have been struggling to extend outer() with a bind argument which is
NULL by default but has the property

	V <- outer(A, B, bind=c(2,3))
	V[i, j, k, l, m, n] == A[i, j, k] * B[l, m, j, n]

The really crude way to do it would be to subscript the full outer object,
but this would use far too much memory for some applications.  I can think
of an alternative which uses a for loop along the bound extent, with a
smaller outer inside the loop.  Has anyone tried to solve this problem, or
have any suggestions for an approach more efficient than the for loop?

Many thanks, Jonathan.

I'm a little behind on versions.  I only have 0.63.3 and haven't found
anything newer...

All kidding regarding typos aside, I went through that floating point
exception business on the Alpha and I just didn't have time to make it
work.  Someone tipped me on to f2c, which I had used with my (old gcc
2.7.2.?) compiler under Linux.  I figured that the fewer different
compilers I played with, the better, so I tried f2c on the alpha.

As it turned out, f2c didn't work with gcc but did work with the
'official' cc from DEC.

I can take the stock distribution of R, and edit config.site adding

MAKE=gnumake
CC=cc

and 

configure --with-f2c 

works just fine.

By the way, this is a very pleasant (and helpful) mailing list !!

Subject: [R] PCA centered
Message-ID: <99031215304400.00474@predict>

I tried make a pca analysis with R. For this propose i need centered rows and
columns. I make this using the function princomp:

> zz<-princomp(x,cor=TRUE)

When i do it each column have mean=0 and standard deviation=1.

But i have this problem: the total inertia, sum of Eigenval., dont is = 
                   =number of columns * 1= sum of total standard deviation

Why? It's a bug in R?

I have make  online this analyse in 
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ADE-4/ADE-4F.html
and everything it's OK.

Thanks in advance

I really don't think this is an R bug; sorry if I've got it wrong twice
within a week.

Using rw0632 on NT 4.0, I can get R running quite happily under ESS
5.1.3. However, whenever I use help(), although I do get the required
help in a split screen, I also get the minibuffer error message:

wrong argument type: processp, nil

Note: I get this under ESS 5.0 as well. I could live with this, but if I
attempt to call help through the menus, or to iESS edit anything, the
whole thing hangs with

Forming completions for Autoloads ...

I've waited up to 15min which I think is long enough to be sure it won't
work. However, ESS 5.0 can cope.

My own fault for updating to a beta of ESS? Anyone else have this
problem?

This is an ESS bug :-(.  Please report to the appropriate people (like
me, or preferably, ess-bugs at stat.math.ethz.ch or
ess-help at stat.math.ethz.ch).

Help, under both Unix and NT, is a bit alpha right now, as I'm
incorporating a few changes to improve Stata support, as well as to
clean up the code (which there, is a bit of a maintenance problem).

    SF> My own fault for updating to a beta of ESS? Anyone else have
    SF> this problem?

I would consider the 5.1.x series alpha, especially with respect to NT
(and I'm the current lead developer, when time permits).  5.1.x do
more, and hence are more broken.  5.0 does less, and is less broken
(but must be configured).

I've still not gotten R running on my Microsoft box, so can't verify
(probably not until Apr 1 or so, I'll be out traveling for the next
2+ weeks).

I'm slightly suprised that you got a hang under 5.1.3 that you didn't
under 5.0.  I'll have to look in to it.

best,

Are you using the M-x R from essd-r32.el?  To do so requires an explicit
M-x load-library RET essd-r32 RET

help works correctly with that version of M-x R.

  It works also for me.

  Since we are speaking about ESS+Rterm: a problem that I have
  is that emacs+ESS seems to 'eat' the "first" request to show a
  window inside Rterm, e.g., first time, I type
  > x11()
  or
  > window()
  no graphics window appears(in my experience never, in others
  experience almost never). From R 
  > .Devices 
  indicates the existence of a new graph. device but it is
  not shown.
  Following "x11()"'s  work.
  Problem seems to be inside ESS (or NT-emacs) since 
  if I substitute Rterm with a 4 lines  program which 
  only shows a modal message box (a "hallo, world" toy),
  then I launch it with M-X R, no message box is shown,
  emacs seems to hang until I kill the toy Rterm with
  the task manager (this has been confirmed to me also by
  Brian Ripley). 

  For the forthcoming rw633, Brian and I have introduced
  a work around but it is limited to the graphics device.
  BTW, in the new version, interaction between emacs and
  the graphics devices should be better since Rterm 
  'waits' for its input from ess in a separate thread.
  Problem here was neither R nor ESS but the Windows
  fgets/ReadFile which default behaviour seems to 'block' 
  the processing of other events.

Thanks for commenting on essd-r32.

I tested rw633 a few days ago.  You indeed have fixed several issues.
For me the focus difficulty in rw632 graphics was a problem.  That is now
working correctly in rw633.

The loss of the first call to a device is puzzling.  I found, and put in the
startup sequence of essd-r32, that calling x11() first, then a plot() command,
made the window visible.  If I called a plot() command without first calling
x11() then the window was invisible.

I have been assuming that the blocking of events from the process was
a consequence of the program not running in bash.  From your file base.html
   Rterm.exe will run from a command line such as an MS-DOS or Commands
   Window running the standard shells, command.com (9x) and cmd.exe (NT)
   but not bash.exe from the Cygwin B20 distribution nor tcsh.exe.
This looks to me like the single-process-at-a-time behavior that DOS lives in.
I therefore assume that making the Rterm work from a bash shell will solve
this and related problems.

Actually, you may have solved that problem already.  I just ran rw633 with
M-x R-sh-dos which you can get from
http:/astro.ocis.temple.edu/~rmh/essd-r32-sh-dos.el
and the graphics window exists with plot() and without first saying x11().
The graph did not come to the front by itself.  I did need to find it with
Alt-Tab, but it was findable.  You might as will pick up
http:/astro.ocis.temple.edu/~rmh/essd-r32.el
while you are there.  It is funcitonally identical to the ESS 5.1.3 distributed
version.  The differneces are that it now specifies rw633 and I have changed
the comments and startup message to reflect the changes you made in rw633.

I have a request for Rterm under ESS.  When I quit with q(), I get a windows
message box asking for confirmation.  The windows box is behind the emacs and
therefore invisible.  I would like that message to appear in the *R* buffer.
Thanks

Rich

you cannot combine DEC F77 with gcc; I do not have g77 to try.)

Dear R users,

I would like to know if there is a package in R 
that estimates multinomial logit models (without
using surrogate Poisson models) 
-or even better- nested multinomial logit models? 

I am using the Windows version of R (Windows 95).

To my understanding, the S package called nnet 
does that, but it seems not to work in R.

Thanking in advance for any help,

Paul Gilbert has informed me of his DSL library for time series

However, it does not work for the Windows 95/98 version of R.
He says that this work entails compiling the fortran into
the appropriate DLL but he neither has the tools nor the
expertise to do this.  Has anybody on the list done this already?
Or has anybody at least been able to just write some code
for performing some basic time series models, e.g. exp. smooth,
ARIMA modeling, etc?

Those tools are publically available, and how to do this is documented in
the distribution of that version of R. You have a PC: why not do the port
yourself and donate your work to the R community?

Those tools are planned for R in due course. But the effort in making
them reliable and documenting them is very considerable. The tasks are
a lot less basic than you appear to believe.  Expect something on a
6-month horizon, not sooner.

multinom (part of nnet) does do it for me on the system you mention.
`does not seem to work in R' is hardly a useful report!

You might also like to look at the plr library for S-PLUS on statlib.

Message-ID: <Pine.3.89.9903160205.A15738-0100000@helios.rz.hu-berlin.de>


Dear List,

invoking qqnorm-plots in Version 63.3 produces funny things:

using the option `type="s"´ on qqnorm should give a nice *line* of
observed quantiles. Now, the line is walking along in order to the
points index instead from lowest to highest, wich makes funny slopes.

try	x <- table(rnorm(1000)	# or similar and
	qqnorm(x,type="s")	# in 0.63.2 and 63.3

Well, the NEWS-file says `qqnorm() uses ppoints() and returns a list
with x sorted along y.´ and, IMHO, that explains the slopes.
But is it generally a bad idea to connect the observed points and
print a nice line instead?

and if not, could anyone explain why it should be x sorted along y?

thanks,
tino

You mean
 
x <- rnorm(1000)
qqnorm(x,type="s")

I believe the reason given at the time was Splus compatibility. We're
still not compatible when it comes to NA handling, though. S(-plus
3.4) gives NA where the original arguments has NA, R just omits NA
cases. This is a bit silly, because the major use I can think of for
the current convention is to obtain a parallel vector to x with the
"expected normal scores" (or an approximation thereof).

To get a prettier plot, use qqnorm(sort(x),type="s")

Come to thik of it wouldn't it be nice to have a general sort=
plotting parameter?

The lme part has been ported to R. You can find a windows version on
CRAN (look under "Binaries for various operating systems")
http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R/mirrors.html

I understand that a full nlme port is difficult due to R/S differences.

I've worked around the problem by removing the is.numeric() test from

Is there a better way of letting R know that it is working with a list
of numerics only?

The problem is that x[1] is not the first component, it is a
sub-list consisting of the first component alone.  If you want
the first *component* you have a couple of choices here,
including

x[[1]], x[["p01"]], x[, 1], x$p01 or x[, "p01"]

but not x[1].

In my view modifying standard system functions is always very bad
idea, but I suppose you're the boss on your machine....

unlist() is designed to flatten lists into vector objects.

This is to report that I have now built R-0.63.3 successfully, using
exactly the same sequence of commands that I had run several times
previously.  In the meantime Nick Guoth from the local IT support ran
configure and gnumake from another machine, but in my directory, and
generated a different error.  I can only conclude that this somehow
had the side effect of fixing a relevant system setting.

  Kjetil,
  I have no much time to test this. But, (under Linux) I went to the 
  R-0.63.3/src/appl directory (where Linpack code lives) and then did a
  > grep dgesl *.f
  No 'dgesl' was found . Hence, my hypothesis is that 'dgesl' 
  is listed in Linpack.h but not included in R. 
  Under Windows, to understand if this is true, you should go to the 
  gnuwin32 directory and then do something like
  > grep dgesl R.exp
or, better,
  > nm libR.a | grep dgesl
  [R.exp lists the symbols exported by R.dll, libR.a is the 'import
   library' for R.dll]
  If no dgesl is shown, I suspect that you have to
  download Linpack and add the files defining dgesl and the other
  function to the package source.

  guido
  
  (ps) Problem is not in the underscore, I think. The underscore
  is appended by the g77 compiler, but the F77_SYMBOL declaration
  in Linpack.h is there to cope with it.

I suspect the fundamental problem is here. Using gcc-libraries from one
version of Solaris and system includes from another one. I don't think
R factors into this at all.

Subject: [R] e1071 and netpbm
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990318154324.12873C-100000@mercury.quantex>

Having compiled and successfully installed e1071 on a previous machine
(and run under 0.62.4) I want to compile it on a new machine to run under
0.63.3 but the loader can't find netpbm - both machined are RH5.2 Linux
installations. 

I have some quite old netpbm's on a CD but none more recent and I
certainly didn't install them on my old machine.  I can't locate or rpm -q
or rpm -qf anything on either machine.  However I seem to have compiled it
previously. Do you have to compile one of the other libraries first or
something?  Rather puzzled.

Is it possible that libpbm can be used instead (in libgr-devel)? Just
speculating, never actually tried it...

you need a development package providing the p?m routines, i.e., pnm.h
and fcts like pnm_readpnm & friends.

in debian this is the netpbm package ... don't now about redhat. best
try to search for pnm.h in the rpm's.

Hope this helps,

  K.,
  I move it to the File/Save as/Postscript menu item on the graphics
  device. I believed that it is  more logical to have it there.
  In addition, before, if you had more than one devices open, it was
  necessary to make the one you wanto to 'convert' active before using
  the menu item. This is not needed now.
  Different opinion?

I started to use the date library, there is one small problem: date objects
cannot be put in data frames (the same for chron objects) Would it be
a good idea to modify data frames so they can accept date and chron
objects? If not, why?

In RH5.2, both of these are in libgr-devel, which I had already loaded. 
However the problem was that the archive files were called
/usr/include/libpbm.a and /usr/include/libpnm.a - there was no net
prefixed.  The solution was therefore to remove the 3 characters 'net'
from the Makefile!!! 

Now it works fine!  Don't know how I got it to work before, though.

Thanks

Pretty useful general functions anyway - they should really have been

Thank you very much for your hard work. One day, when I go back to

Subject: [R] How to get '\h' through print() or paste()?
Message-ID: <19990320220506.A888@uucp.goe.net>

Hello,

[really hoping not to ask something the 1001th time]

I need single backslashes printed for generating TeX-code.

That works:

  > print("\begin{tabular}")
  [1] "\begin{tabular}"

But \h seems to be interprated in some way:

  > print('\hline')
  [1] "hline"

Hm, trying to mask the backslash:

  > print('\\hline')
  [1] "\\hline"
  
But I need "\hline"...

Is there a way without generating strange code in a temporary file for
"sed"ing it? It would be also nice to get rid of the leading number in
brackets for each line of output...

Thanks,
Knut

I have always taken the naming of R and S (and C for that matter)
to be one of those little mysteries best left unexplained.  It
invariably annoys students immensely when you tell them this!  I
have seen some explanations of how C got its name that have
always been extremely weak and unconvincing, which is probably
just a reinforcement of my contention.  The only really strong
opinion I have had from the originators is that "S" does NOT
stand for "Statistics" (presumably it is supposed to cover much
more...)

There is another system for data analysis and graphics called "R
code", by the way, which has nothing whatever to do with R.  I am
surprised that there has never been much confusion, although the
potential is certainly there.

Those few of us in a position to have encountered it may recall a
mathematical programming language called MIRFAC, which allegedly stood
for "Mathematics In Recognisable Form Automatically Compiled".

It was more plausibly suspected of having been named after the brightest
star (alpha Persei, aka "Mirfak") in the constellation of Perseus, rather
than the second brightest (beta Persei, aka "Algol").

So it wouldn't be the first time ... I hope, however, that R fares
better than MIRFAC did viz-a-viz its antagonym (to coin a word).

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Escaping the backslash with another one is the right thing and gives you
what you want, it is just that print() returns it the way it was typed
in.

Consider

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.05.9903211956510.4632-100000@hansel.moorhead.msus.edu>

I am new to R, so please be patient. Most of my experience with
interpreted statistical languages is with SPSS and SAS. I have extensive
fortran experience. I have printed and read the R manual.

I compiled 0.63.3 on an alpha-linux (LX board, Linux is RH 5.1) and have
had difficult. The configure script recognized the architecture and
compiled/linked the sources with less trouble than I had on a Intel
machine (where I had to change optimizations for gcc).

First, the latest "official" release is 61.something. What is 63.3? Do
version number convey information beyond sequence/major-minor releases?

Second, on Intel, I cannot use destructive erase (backspace or ^H). I am
running this in an xterm and have not tried an emacs shell. No such
trouble on the alpha platform. Is this an ncurses version problem? If so,
what version do I need. Is it a terminal emulation problem? If so, is
there a spot in the configure.in file to set this --in the Makefile?

With my typing, I need the destructive backspace. Hence, the next point
applies to the alpha platform only.

Third, the failures I am getting on the alpha occur trying to plot fortran
generated x,y coordinates that are read from file (along with 30 some
other measures) with Dat <- table.read(). I have extracted the relevant
measures to what I thought would be vectors with x <-
Dat[correct_subscript], y <- Dat[sub]. (Dumping x and y looks correct,
though data values have quotes -- it looks like strings of digits rather
than floating point numbers?) Plot(x,y) give "unable to coerce to vector
14(?)" (paraphrase).

cor(x,y) returns the same error.

The example session in the manual appendix works and the demos work.

In contrast, generating x and y in other ways (x<-c(...), x<-seq(..) and
feeding them to functions that assume vectors works.

Thank you for any help.

Is there a simple say of extracting the shape parameter from gnlr?  The
return given is the actual function rather than the value.  I have looked
at all the values returned by names(gnlr).

ie

gmod<-gnlr(data,....)

gmod$shape

returns the function definition rather than the value found.

Simple case I am using it is for censored normal data (rather simpler than
survival4 it seems).  The value printed is the log of the variance (it
seems).

Message-ID: <36F6221A.3F2D7482@ipimar.pt>

Hi all !

I'm sure this is a question that annoys some of you but I'm really
needing help on this !

I've been using R for about 1 year now. I'm a biologist, so stats are a
tool for my research not the end itself. During this time I've enjoyed
working with R but the graphical part of it drives me crazy and the
small possibilities in terms of reading some file formats also causes me
problems.

Two weeks ago I've had the chance of bying a license for Splus 5 for
linux. After some trouble with their representant because of a stupid
license scheme I've managed to install and work with it. The things I
needed are know working: I can access different files formats (at lest
they say so) and the graphs are better. On the other way the program
it's not so linux integrated as I thougth, it uses emacs or vi styles
(wich I hate) instead of the updownrightleft keys, it has a strange
system of files and it's not compatible with the m$win versions (wich
would allow me to work together with other scientists that use m$win.

Know I'm quite confused about my choice R or Splus !!

Can you give me some opinions on this ?!

thanks

  Maybe you have already, but: have you told the R-help list (or the
R-devel list) what your "wish list" for R is?  Specifically, what file
formats do you need to read, and what don't you like about R graphics?
(The only thing I know about that is different between R and S+ graphics
is the 3-D plotting capabilities, which are supposedly in progress ...
although admittedly I work with an old (3.?) version of S+.)  If you
specify your needs, someone might help you out.
   R may not be as complete as S+, but it sure is easier to change if you
don't like it.

Message-ID: <XFMail.990322145503.plummer@iarc.fr>

[Snip: Problems installing the e1071 package on Red Hat Linux]

Instead of having a single netpbm library, Red Hat has four libraries
(all provided by the libgr rpm), with recursive dependencies

libpnm -> libppm -> libpgm -> libpbm

So, for example, libpbm stands alone but libpgm contains references to
functions in libpbm.  This means that if you want to use any functions
in libpnm (which we do), you must also link against the other three
libraries. If you don't do this, then the compiler won't complain about
undefined references when you type "R INSTALL e1071", since it is building
a shared object, but you will get run time errors.

I can't see the advantage of splitting the library, myself. I wrote to
Red Hat about this in November but didn't get a reply.  It looks like
various other Linux distributions which use the RPM packager (OpenLinux,
TurboLinux, LinuxPPC, ...) use the same setup.

I use the patch below when compiling on Red Hat

Hi!!

	With the hope that is hasn't been suggested already!!

> R-devel list) what your "wish list" for R is?  Specifically, what file
> formats do you need to read, and what don't you like about R graphics?

	I take the challenge!! I am also an "end user" of R. I am starting to
use the R and my opinion about it is quite positive.  I am actually on the
process to learn the tools I was using in another package (Stata) in R, in
order to keep on using the same things than before but under a new
environment that I think is much more open and interesting. I also think that
as I will never use the 100% of an statistical package power, R is the choice
for me if I find there what I need.

	As a user of the system I would enjoy seeing for example of R
performing "against"  some other systems, commertial or free. Seeing R
working out the same examples as some standard statistical packages would
give confidence at the time of choosing between commertial software or R,
eventhough commertial packages results can be questionable as well
sometimes. 

	I also suppose that if one of the interests in R can be an
improvement in computational times, benchmarking can be a nice thing. It is a
bit "childish" to amuse the people saying that "our program is faster and
better than yours", but if a good testbed is made then people can take
decisions in those terms. Eventhough R would perform slower than other
programs I think that having that information available would also give a
good marketing and honestity (which is, in my opinion, one of the virtues of
free software), and many people with different needs would be able to make a
decision about whether R was adequate for them or not...

It works for me on intel.  Check out the Keyboard and Console HOWTO since
I did pretty much everything they suggested, including:

.inputrc:
	"\C-?":delete-char
	"\C-h":backward-delete-char

.bashrc:
	stty erase ^h

.Xresources
	*VT100*backarrowKey: true

/etc/keyboard/default.map:
	key 14 = Backspace
	key 111 = Delete

I have no idea anymore which of these incantations is required, and it
probably depends on which system you are running.  Also, I may have
missed a couple.

Which sounds exactly like the problem I had.  It seems table.read()
returns a list, and Dat[correct_subscript] is a list of one element
that element being the vector of interest.  Try using instead
Dat[[correct_subscript]] which returns the single element rather
than the whole list.

Perhaps a better way, if your colleagues are unfortunate enough to have to
work in M$win, is to get VMware.  This sits on a host system (Linux or, if
you have to, NT) and enables one or more virtual machines to be set up,
each completely independent of the other.  It therefore enables you to run
at more or less full speed any i86 operating system - W95, W98, NT, Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris Intel, DOS, etc (are there any more?).  Thus you could
have NT on Linux or W95 on Linux, different flavours of Linux running all
on the same machine, a few proper DOS machines, a FreeBSD for testing, or
whatever you want.  It sets up a virtual platform sharing all devices as
necessary and is seen as a separate machine with it's own IP number etc
both within the host system and by any external machines that are
permitted to see it.

It is commercial but the price is quite modest and much less than the
difference in prices for W95 and Linux implementations for certain
software such as S+.  Thus you kill two birds for the price of one!

Check out www.vmware.com - beta test and evaluation versions are currently
available.  It is due for launch in May and everyone that has used it says
it works very  well.  I haven't loaded it yet because I have to rearrange
my disk partitions but I will shortly.  Promise!

I don't know whether this was your problem, but several times I've found
that I can't read in a "dump"ed R object, but can read in a corresponding
text file (read.table).  Strangely enough, I found I couldn't read in an R
object that I had been able to create.

But if you're trying to read an R object, recreating it and saving it as
some sort of text table, and reading it in using read.table might work.

Hope this helps,

Matt Wiener

This sounds similar to vnc, which is free (I think even under GPL):

Not at all, really. VNC is essentially a "windowing" system which allows
the sceen, mouse and keyboard of one physical machine to be mirrored on
another different physical machine, and little more than that. It is not
intrinsically symmetrical: the machine displayed is the "server" and
the machine displaying is the "viewer", and you start up different
VNC programs for server and viewer.

VNware, on the other hand, creates a virtual PC (or several) in software
within the single physical machine it is running on. Each such virtual PC
can boot up any operating system. So, as John wrote, you can have Linux,
W/95/98/NT etc., all running at the same time on the same physical PC.
The virtual PCs can all communicate with each other over a virtual
network internal to the physical PC as if they were on different physical
PCs on a real network. And so on. I suppose you could have VNC running on
all these virtual machines as well ...

So you could run S-plus in Windows and R in Linux simultaneously on one
PC, for instance. (In theory).

To people who are interested: to install it on Linux you will need a
recent version of Linux which is glibc (libc6) based. It won't work
on libc5 versions.

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

R statics allocates memory space at start time, it defaults to 8 Megs.

So in unix try:

$ R  --vsize 16M 
(or more)

in Windows:

Create a shortcut to the Rgui binary and add a similar command option to
the shortcut.

In Emacs ESS mode
C-u M-x R, and then add --vsize xxM in the first prompt

Can I try to be rather precise. John Chambers' 1998 book is about version 4
of the S language: one of its roles is the manual for that language. Sv4 is
not available outside a small group of people, but is the basis for S-PLUS
5.x.  Note though that S-PLUS 5.x differs in a number of ways from Sv4.

R is currently `not unlike' S version 3 and S-PLUS 3.x.  The ideas in
Chambers' book about programming design and new features are very valuable,
but I think the details will confuse anyone who is not using Sv4, possibly
including those using S-PLUS 5.x.

On the other hand, I think most books about S-PLUS 3.x would help
in understanding R.  One in particular has on-line material to assist its
use with R.

Yes. Strictly speaking it is equivalent to tsplot(),
not ts.plot(), apart from the fact that tsplot
accepts a list of time series.

R doesn't have the S-PLUS time series classes rts, its
and cts. It only has vanilla time series created by
ts. In R, unlike S, vanilla time series are "classed"
objects, which allows the appropriate plot method to be
despatched by the plot() function and there is no need
for the user to call a separate function tsplot().

Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.19990324113614.007b34e0@graylab.ac.uk>

Dear R-help,

I'm using 63.3 on windows NT. The improved graphics device has  a problem
in that the default par settings produce text that is way too small (63.2
seemed fine). I've compared the parameters between 63.3 and 63.2 and the
ones that differ are : cin, cra, csi, mai, pin, plt. In the par help file,
cin and cra have no documentation other than that they are read only, the
last three don't appear to concern text size. The all important one is csi,
the height of default characters in inches, in 63.2 it is 0.2755906, in
63.3 it's 
0.1377953, unfortunately it is also read only. I suppose in theory this can
solved using cex, but that alters everything, and in a scatterplot, say,
you get circles that look rather too big, and it generally contravenes the
'flexibility is paramount' philosophy of R/S+. I guess what I'm asking is
how do you get around the read only problem, or what's an alternative?  

Incidently, the 63.3 doesn't have the lty problem with lines(), as was
predicted.

Thanks,

Simon Bond.

Subject: [R] Change of parsing parameters to functions between 0.63.1 and 0.63.3 ?
Message-ID: <36F91676.3B1D13FF@ogs.co.uk>


Hi,


I wonder whether the mechanism of parsing parameters to functions has
changed between 0.63.1 and 0.63.3? The following code yeils different
results in R 0.63.1 (Version 0.63.1  (Dec 5, 1998)) and R 0.63.3. 

cave<-function(x,a,b)
{
	return(c(mean(x[a],na.rm=T),mean(x[b],na.rm=T)))
}
datx <- data.frame(rbind(c(1,2,3,4),c(4,5,6,7)))
names(datx)<-c("A","B","C","D")
f1<-c("A","C")
f2<-c("B","D")
t1<-apply(datx,1,cave,f1,f2)




R 0.63.1 Result:


> t1
     1 2
[1,] 2 5
[2,] 3 6


R 0.63.3 Result:

> t1
       1   2
[1,] NaN NaN
[2,] NaN NaN


If I include a 

cat("x[a]->",a,"x[b]->",b,"\n")

in the function (cave)

R 0.63.1 shows the

x[a]-> 1 3 x[b]-> 2 4
x[a]-> 4 6 x[b]-> 5 7

Whereas in R 0.63.3 the result is :

x[a]-> NA NA x[b]-> NA NA 
x[a]-> NA NA x[b]-> NA NA 

Obviously, something is not right. I have verified this in both Unix
(Solaris, Linux) and also on WinNT

However, R Version

Version 0.64.0 Unstable (February 4, 1999)

Reports a similar behaviour to Version 0.63.1 : i.e. giving me the
correct results. 

Many Thanks,


Athula

Yep. Error was that element names were not passed on to the FUN in
apply() in the vector case. The following patch (against 0.63.x
snapshot or 0.64 unstable) seems to fix it:

The help page for apply says

Arguments:

       x: the array to be used.

and your x is not an array, although R does an as.matrix for you. The
problem is that you are expecting apply to hand you a row vector labelled
by the column names of the (coerced) matrix. This is true in some versions
of R but not in others, and AFAIK is not documented to be expected. The
names of a vector are attributes, and we have been debating which
attributes should be retained on subsetting (as here).

Yes, but that is an old snapshot: it does not do so on the March 24, 1999
version. (What is `correct' is debatable: I would suggest that your code is
incorrect if (as I think) it relies on undocumented features. (But then
most R code would be classified as incorrect!)

Many thanks for Prof Ripley and also Peter Dalgaard  for offering help
in this issue. I have
now changed the code to do the right thing. The function has been
changed to:


cave<-function(x,a,b,bb)
{
    names(x)<-bb
    cat("x[a]->",x[a],"x[b]->",x[b],"\n")
 
    return(c(mean(x[a],na.rm=T),mean(x[b],na.rm=T)))
}
datx <- data.frame(rbind(c(1,2,3,4),c(4,5,6,7)))
names(datx)<-c("A","B","C","D")
f1<-c("A","C")
f2<-c("B","D")
t1<-apply(datx,1,cave,f1,f2,names(datx))

It works fine.

Thanks again for your kind help.

Brian is too modest to mention explicitly that it is his book with
Bill Venables, "Modern Applied Statistics with S-PLUS", that he has in
mind.  See
		 http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2/
for more information.

Their book is widely regarded as the best introduction to S-PLUS and
related languages.  Especially when supplemented with their "R
Complements" document, available from the above-mentioned web site, it
provides an excellent tutorial introduction to R.

That is a modified version of notes by Bill Venables and Dave Smith for
S-PLUS, and those datasets are available for loading into S-PLUS in
various places, http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/S for one.

If no one else has already done so, I will arrange with Bill Venables to
re-package them as an R package and submit to CRAN.

Several of the datasets have since turned up in our MASS library:
Janka, Gasoline, Michelson-Morley, rat, snail, Stormer, steam, painters
at least.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990325131228.11939A-100000@pcinternet.biochem.dshs-koeln.de>

Hello everybody,

I frequently have to produce barplots from variables the natural variation
of which is far away from zero. A typical range would be, say from -16 to
-28.

So, the following example should give an "honest" presentation:

x<-c(-20,-22,-21,-28)
barplot(x,beside=T,ylim=c(-18,-30))

But using anything else but "0" for the first element of ylim
leads to strange results, as the bars "ignore" the X-axis and keep on
extending to zero. (R 0.63.2, Linux 2.0.25)

Any idea how to avoid this behaviour (without doing a rewrite of
"barplot")?

I suppose some would say you deserve what you get and that it doesn't
really make sense to describe such data with barplots...

However, if you insist, try something like:

x<-c(-20,-22,-21,-28)
names(x)<-c("eenie","meenie","miney","moe")
barplot(-x-18,beside=T,ylim=c(0,12),axes=F)
axis(2,at=seq(0,12,2),labels=seq(-18,-30,-2))

Hi,

I had a problem passing characters from R into c-code by dyn.load() and .C().

test.c:
	void R2Cdouble(double *db)
	{
		printf("\n my double: %f \n", db[0]);
	}

test.R:
	dyn.load("mylib.so");
	.C("R2Cdouble", as.double(0.5));

worked fine, but

test1.c:
	void R2Cstr(char *str)
	{
		printf("\n my char: %s \n", str[0]);
	}

test1.R:
	dyn.load("mylib.so");
	.C("R2Cdouble", as.character("test"));

caused a segmentation fault (Linux 2.0.36, R-0.62.4).

Is there a mechanism to do that?

Nope. You're missing something about the ":" operator

1:3 == c(1,2,3)
3:1 == c(3,2,1)

dim=3:1 means you want this as a 3x2x1 array, 6 cells in total, but 3 data.

1x2x3-array...

2:2 = from 2 to 2 step 1 = 2

2-array, four values

1x2x3x4 array, 24 cells, four values.

Subject: [R] packages under windows installation guide?
Message-ID: <s6f9ddff.006@hartcrowser.com>

Hi
 I was trying to install a package (sgeostat) under windows but the r-faq only tells how to do it under unix.
 Question:
  1) is there documentation on how install a package under windows?

Thanx

bob sandefur

First of all, get the binary version from CRAN, in 

.../bin/windows/windows-NT/contrib/

Then simply unzip it into the ...rw063?/library/ directory along with
base and modreg, etc. Be sure to use an unzipper that preserves
directory structure, of course.

You must declare str as char **str.  The basic character vector in R
is a vector of strings, not a vector of characters.  Notice that the
way you are printing it assumes that str[0] is char *, not char.
If you change your example to

test1.c:
	void R2Cstr(char **str)
	{
		printf("\n my char: %s \n", str[0]);
	}

test1.R:
	dyn.load("mylib.so");
	.C("R2Cdouble", as.character("test"));

it should work.

Yes, in the rw-FAQ distributed with the current Windows version (and in the
readme.packages too, I believe).

The answer is that it is very easy: get the compiled zip file from
CRAN, and unzip in rw0633/library.

Subject: [R] lme problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990325175823.23590A-100000@mercury.quantex>

Hi

I am trying to get to grips with lme and perhaps the euro-cent is not
dropping.  I want to define a model with some terms random and some fixed
so that:

gd<-groupedData(y~x|c,df)

defining by the group c in data frame df, whereupon

mod<-lme(y~t+f,gd,~t)

where I want the t as a random effect and the f as the fixed part. 

Without the f it works OK but when I add the f, I get an error message
from model.frame saying there is an error in the lengths.  As far as I can
see, all the lengths are the same (and I have checked it with length() of
course).

Is there an obvious reason for this?  I am probably doing something stupid
but it escapes me at the moment.  I will try and do the same with MLn this
evening ...

John

What you are doing looks reasonable.  Since the version of lme in the
R library is rather old it is possible that the fault lies in the
lme code rather than in your understanding of the lme code.

Jose' Pinheiro and I had a chance to talk with many of the R
developers at the Vienna conference and I think we understand much
better now how to modify the current lme code for use with R.  We hope
to bring the lme library in R up-to-date with the beta version of
nlme-3.0 for S-PLUS but we can't promise a release date on that yet.

Could you send us a transcript of your session including the output of
 traceback()
after you get the error condition?  That could help a lot tracking
down the problem.

fortran?), but is there a better way of doing what to me is intuitive but
gives completely the wrong answer.  The following result occurs: 

a<-kronecker(1:4,t(11:15)) # Gives 4x5 matrix with unique elements

# 11 12 13 14 15
# 22 24 26 28 30
# 33 36 39 42 45
# 44 48 52 56 60

b<-c(1,2,4,5)                 # The columns to extract for each of 4 rows
z<-a[,b]                      # Gives a 4x4 matrix 

# 11 12 14 15
# 22 24 28 30
# 33 36 42 45
# 44 48 56 60

ie a[1:4,b]

The only way I can see of getting the vector result I want is:

z<-rep(0,4);for (i in 1:4){z[i]<-a[i,b[i]]}

# 11 24 42 60

whereas a[1,b] returns

# 11 12 14 15

Mind you, the same happens in Octave!  Ugh.  Is there a more elegant way
without constructing the appropriate elementary matrix or am I mad?  These
are not exclusive possibilites of course!

BTW the command element(x,i) which is in the HTML help for 0.63.3 is
missing.

Well, there's diag(a[,b]) or sapply(1:4,function(i)a[i,b[i]]) or
(double-UGH!! but efficient) Fortran style a[(b-1)*nrow(a)+1:4]

(And probably an obvious one that I've forgotten for the moment...)

Indeed there is and just about everyone does forget it:

> z <- a[cbind(1:4, b)]
> z
[1] 11 24 42 60

You can also work it in the other direction:

> a
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]   11   12   13   14   15
[2,]   22   24   26   28   30

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]   11    0   13   14   15
[2,]   22   24    0   28   30
[3,]    0   36   39   42   45
[4,]   44   48   52   56    0

It's sometimes called a "matrix index" which can be a bit
confusing since the *index* is the matrix as well as the thing
it indexes (though the latter can be an arbitrary array).

Subject: [R] can R produce gifs?
Message-ID: <AAMKJPEFBNCMAAAA@hotbot.com>

Dear R users,

I would like to produce gifs or jpegs with R,
as I would like to display them on a webpage.
Is there an easier/faster/better way to do it 
than to generate postscript files and then use
a utility like pstogif. The problem is that if 
possible I would like to get away without installing
ghostscript, as my quota is too small.

Thank you very much for your time and bandwidth,

	Ananke

You don't tell us your platform. The Windows version can produce gifs
and metafiles.

--------

I cannot help you with translation,
but want to thank you in advance for your efforts!

Note that the current version of "Notes on R" (available from CRAN)
is really outdated. 
I have been adding some corrections and Fritz Leisch and others from 
TU Wien will do some more in the next few days.
The resulting "Notes" will still be a long way from both complete and
100% correct, but still quite a bit better than currently.

Plans exist to write "R Tutorial(s)" from scratch, eventually replacing 
the "Notes".

There is an HDF5 interface in recent versions of R, at least on Unix.  If
you have libhdf5 in the library path it should be automatically
configured.

The commands are hdf5save() and hdf5load().

 For people that just want to use Rweb:
  1. The ability to upload data files from the users machine (thanks
     to a suggestion from Luke Tierney).
  2. Improved graphics printing in the Javascript version.

 For people that want to setup their own Rweb server:
  1. Improved security.
  2. Postscript is converted to gif format using the netPBM library
     rather than the latex2html scripts (thanks to a comment from
     Mark Ray)
  3. A configure and install script that can (hopefully) setup the 
     configuration for your machine and then install all of the 
     parts into the appropriate places.

Anyone that is interested in setting up their own Rweb server may
look at the Rweb Readme file at:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990330123755.593A-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

Is it possible to access data objects and functions that are saved in a
.Rdata different (e.g. in another directory) than that which is currently
in use but without loading it into the .GlobalEnv, but possibly such that
it would appear in search location 2? 

Obvoiulsy attach() does not work with files and to make a library seems to
be a bit of an overkill.

Thanks for any hints, Lorenz

Subject: [R] idea for (further) debugging ace ()?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990330151748.814A-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

I am trying to use ace on a 446 x 14 Matrix, with two categorical
variables in the first two columns. If I try to run it I get:

>   aceiH <- ace (data.mat, resp, cat= 1:length(x.cat))
Error: NAs in foreign function call (arg 3)

There is only one .Fortran call in ace () with the third argument being 
x = t(x). Thus I tried to debug ace, i.e. I went through ace until just
before the call to .Fortran. I can play with all the variables in the call
and all seem to be ok, specifically there are no NAs in t(x) but the call
fails also while debugging:

> debug (ace)
>   aceiH <- ace (data.mat, resp, cat= 1:length(x.cat))
debugging in: ace(data.mat, resp, cat = 1:length(x.cat))
debug: x <- as.matrix(x)
Browse[1]> 
... ## go through ace until before .Fortran call
Browse[1]> table (is.na (t(x)))
FALSE 
 6244 
Browse[1]> 
debug: junk <- .Fortran("mace", p = ncol(x), n = nrow(x), x = t(x), 
    y = y, w = wt, l = l, delrsq = delrsq, ns = ns, tx = tx, 
    ty = ty, rsq = double(1), ierr = integer(1), m = m, z = z)
Browse[1]> junk
Error: Object "junk" not found

I am trying to find a smaller example that has the same effect so I could
send it to the list but was not successful until now, especially as I do
not really have any idea in what direction to search.

Any pointers or ideas are appreciated. Regards, Lorenz

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.00.9903301618400.778-100000@alpha5-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at>


Hi,

I updated my R rpms for SuSE systems. They are now available both for
S.u.S.E 5.3 and SuSE 6.0 under 

  ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R/bin/linux/suse/

Additionally I put binaries for DEC Alpha systems running Digital Unix 4.0
under

  ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R/bin/osf/osf4.0/alpha/

These packages are available as rpms and as a setld kit. setld is the
Digital Unix package maintanance tool, see setld(1), ask your admin or
read the acompanying README files how to use it.

Of course, if you want to use the rpms you first have to get "rpm" running
on your DU system. It is (normally) available at 

  ftp://ftp.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/uni-klu.ac.at/rpms/RPMS/osf4.0/

But currently this site is under reconstruction, so please check again in
a few weeks.


I hope I got all packages right, if you encounter problems, mail me.

Is it a big issue to put such a statement in R? or this has legal implications
that R do not want as a "free" software? 

If possible I would like to see the statement on both Unix AND Win version

It is an important issue. R, as the licensing says, "comes with no
warranty whatsoever". We can't provide any guarantee that R does any
particular thing correctly.

Also, if the university wants "Y2K compliance" without giving any
specification of exactly what they mean it sounds like they are just
making sure that they will be able to blame someone if things go wrong.

If they are actually interested in whether R is likely to die on
1/1/{20}00 then you could reassure them that the basic R distribution
doesn't represent years as two-digit strings anywhere. However, there is
nothing to stop the user from doing so -- garbage in, garbage out.

In any case, the current R (0.63.3) will probably be several versions
obsolete by Y2K, though there's no particular reason to think it will be
any more buggy in January than in December.

I have already downloaded ESS.

One of the steps in the installation guide is to edit the file :
ess-site.el and "uncomment corresponding lines " ....I really don't get
what are these lines ??.

any help will be appreciated,

Apart from Thomas' contribution, and the pass-the-buck mentality of many
computing departments (even in Universities, to their shame), if you mount
R on a Unix system (including Linux) then there are no real Y2K issues -
there is a Y2038 issue that will be solved by the 8 byte counter.  This is
because Unix/Linux maintains it's system time independently of the
hardware, currently in a 4 byte counter of seconds since 1970.  The
hardware clock is only used to compare times at shutdown/startup and by
the clock -w instruction which resets it from system time.

Well one great advantage of R is that you can send them the source code so
they can look for themselves.  Try that with other products.

See above re Unix.  But presumably they haven't mounted some very well
known packages from Microsoft that are not yet Y2K compliant the last time
I looked at their web site.

Good luck with your quest.

Dear all,

I am still trying to find out what goes wrong when I use ace (I get an
'NAs in foreign fuction call (arg3)' but when I go through it with debug
there seem no data to be missing). 

I had some errors (see at end of message) while installing 'acepack'. Do
you think it is possible that these lead to the fact, that simple problems
run ok but larger problems result in an error that R sees as there being
NAs? Does anyone know how to go around this? Can I set the flags for g77
differently? Could this be a problem that I am not using the most recent R
version (I delayed upgrading because I thought I might finish the current
project before it but if this is suspicious I go for the most recent
version now). 

Any pointers or ideas are appreciated. Regards, Lorenz

Some part of the argument named is NA or NaN or Inf: the message is
misleading.  You ought to be able to find this by debugging. If you
are really stuck, send me an example to try.

IHMO, no.

Add commas! Works for me.

This belongs on the ess-help list, not on the R-help list, as it is an
ESS specific question.  Did you read the ess-site file?  It steps you
through the necessary configuration changes that you might need.
However, for most people, it might work as is (except for perhaps the
ess-lisp-directory variable).

If you need more assistance, please send mail to

	ess-help at stat.math.ethz.ch

as is mentioned in the documentation.
