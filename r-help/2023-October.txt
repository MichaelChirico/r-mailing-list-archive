One more function to consider using and teaching is the attach
function.  If you use `attach` with a the name of a file that was
created using `save` then it creates a new, empty environment, `load`s
the contents of the file into the environment, and attached the
environment to the search path (by default in position 2).  This means
that the objects are all available to use, but will not overwrite any
objects of the same name in your workspace.  The command `ls(2)`
quickly shows the names of the objects that were read in.  You can use
simple assignment to copy and optionally rename any of the objects
into your workspace, or just leave them in the attached workspace
(just recognize what will happen if you have multiple objects with the
same name).  Once you have copied or used the objects of interest, you
can simply `detach` the environment.

If you are going to teach the use of `attach` I would suggest
emphasizing the 2nd paragraph under the heading "Good practice" on the
help page for attach.

Subject: [R] New version of the Iso package is now up on CRAN.
Message-ID: <20231003111152.63c24295@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


There was a deficiency in the argument list of the ufit() function in
the Iso package which made it all too easy to conflate a specified
location for the maximum with the *index* of that location in the "x"
argument.  This problem was kindly drawn to my attention by Zhiwei
Zhang.

The deficiency is remedied in the new version (Iso_0.0-21).  The
argument list for ufit() has changed.  There is a new argument "imode"
to specify the index of the location.  The argument "lmode" is now
restricted to being one of the entries of "x" (and an error is thrown
if it is not).  At most one of "imode" and "lmode" may be specified.

The source of the new version is now available on CRAN, as is the Mac
OSX binary.  The Windoze binary should be available soon.

Note that the change to Iso breaks the current version of the UMR
package.  The maintainer of UMR has been notified, and a revision of
UMR should become available sometime in the near future.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] maptools, rgdal, rgeos and rgrass7 retiring Monday,
 October 16
Message-ID: <SV0P279MB04755A943724ADEE275CDEBCEEC4A@SV0P279MB0475.NORP279.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

The legacy R spatial infrastructure packages maptools, rgdal and rgeos will be archived by CRAN on Monday, October 16, 2023; rgrass7 has  already been replaced by rgrass and will be archived with the retiring packages. 

The choice of date matches the previously announced archiving during October 2023, and the specific date matches the release schedule of Bioconductor 3.18 (some Bioconductor packages depend on retiring packages).

sp_2.1-0 was published October 2, 2023, dropping all dependencies on the retiring packages. sp will continue to be available and maintained, but not developed further. Users of sp classes may continue to make use of them, but will have to use sf or terra to read, write or manipulate objects with coercion (for a guide to coercion, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgrass/vignettes/coerce.html).

Information about the evolution project may be found in reports and resources at https://r-spatial.github.io/evolution/; a recent blog by Jakub Nowosad may also be useful as an overview of what has been going on: https://geocompx.org/post/2023/rgdal-retirement/. For more detail, see https://r-spatial.github.io/evolution/ogh23_bivand.html and a video recording of this presentation https://av.tib.eu/media/63141 (August 28).

All directly affected package maintainers have been alerted to the impending changes, some in December 2022, most others in March-April 2023. Many have already updated their packages on CRAN - thank you for your understanding! The remainder received github issue comments and email reminders in the last ten days, and will receive final notices to update by October 9. 

On R-universe, builds of packages archived on CRAN are dropped automatically (https://github.com/r-universe-org/help/issues/286). Read-only github mirrors of archived packages will remain available in principle while github exists (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/568), for example https://github.com/cran/rgdal. Other binary builds (Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu) have been alerted; support at Anaconda has been alerted.

On CRAN, the retired packages will continue to be available as source packages on https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive. maptools, rgdal and rgeos also retain their R-forge repositories, which may be used to retrieve functions for adding to other packages.

A snapshot of Windows and macOS binary packages may be found on https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/tree/main/backstore.

Please raise questions by replying to this post, or as issues on https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution.

    It's conceivable that functions in a contributed package would

does nothing like that (unless you explicitly ask it to).

This is mostly true. (There are other ways of installing R, but it is
most frequently downloaded from a CRAN mirror.)

This is not exactly the case.

It is possible to prepare data using Microsoft Excel and store it in
the Microsoft Excel format, but the actual import process is performed
either using base R functions (e.g. read.csv(), which is built into R),
or using third-party packages running inside R (e.g. "openxlsx", which
is available on CRAN) that implement the functions necessary to
transform Excel format into R data structures.

It is also possible to prepare data using other software, or type it
manually into R, or store it only in R's native data format (using
the saveRDS() or save() functions).

As long as you're running R on your own computer, it should keep the
data locally. The words of a J. Random Hacker from the Internet don't
carry much weight with government agencies (as they shouldn't), but the
source code of R is open to audits. Additionally, there are some
guidance documents at <https://www.r-project.org/certification.html>.

Note that this only covers R itself and not any third-party software
packages that you could be using together with R. (You could also be
connecting to an RStudio server or running an instance of webR in your
web browser, in which case your data is subject to the privacy policy
of the server administrators.) For example, the "googleCloudRunner"
package available on CRAN is designed for the purpose of running code
on Google infrastructure and will send the data there if asked to.

CRAN packages are required never to do anything that might be regarded
as antisocial <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html>,
but a dedicated attacker may be able to slip something past the
reviewers anyway.

Since your e-mail address contains nhs.uk, the
<https://nhsrcommunity.com/> website could help you find the
information you need.

I am pretty sure you'll get more replies than mine, so just consider this
as part of the story.

Your understanding is confused/flawed.

1. R can be downloaded from hundreds/thousands of software repositories,
not just CRAN.

2. R can read/upload data in hundreds of different formats, not just
Excel's. R makes no use of Excel to read external files (I wasn't clear
what you meant here).

3. As Ben said, it is certainly possible that some R packages -- optional
add-ons extending R capabilities ---  communicate with and store data or
results on external servers. R,  itself, can run locally and can store
results either locally or externally. Like most software, it can also be
integrated as part of the infrastructure on a server for web applications.

If you have a specific question not addressed by these various replies, ask
it. You will most likely get a useful reply.

Cheers,
Bert

I would answer "local files only," but with sufficient motive it is possible for some people to abuse a system. Base R does not download any of your data. The packages that I know about do not download data. You can add a layer of protection by only downloading directly from the source rather than through some third party. If you are skilled, you should be able to read through the source code to check for statements that would write your data to an external source.

Another viewpoint: R is an approved software for the University of Florida. The University is very aware of regulations and risks associated with personally identifiable information. Downloading to an external location would be a security risk that the University would not allow. That said, the university provides students and employees  an approved link for downloading the software. It is designed to help people avoid third party sites and associated risks.

If this is an issue with personally identifiable information, then you should check with your employer if R is an approved software.

Charity,

As some of the answers I have seen show, your question is not clear.

You need to be clear on what you mean about R software and other concepts
before an answer makes sense.

The Base version of R may come on your computer already but likely has been
installed from some external source, or updated and the CRAN mirrors are one
such installation. As far as I know, it downloads the main R software as
well as packages considered important as part of that distribution and from
then on, you can disconnect your computer from any network and it will work
fine for any programs that operate only locally. 

Of course any program you run that wishes to access external resources can
do so. In particular, it is quite common for you at the prompt, or within an
R program, to ask for a package stored externally to be placed within your
computer but once done, it remains there until and unless you want to get a
newer version or something.

There are packages that include data within themselves and may well be some
that dynamically go out and get info from somewhere but I know of no simple
way to find out other than reading the source code or seeing what happens if
you disconnect from the internet.

Your mention of EXCEL also needs clarification. EXCEL has absolutely nothing
to do with R. It is an unrelated product and you do not need to have it
installed to run R and vice versa. That does not mean your program cannot
interact with EXCEL or the files it makes, just that it is not part of base
R. R does allow importing data (locally or not) in lots of formats including
some that EXCEL can save data in. But generally, internal to R there are
storage methods such as the data.frame that hold data and manipulate it and
a typical R program may read in some data from files like .CSV that can be
saved from EXCEL or many other sources or with the proper packages, you can
read directly from more native EXCEL formats such as XLSX files. And, you
can write out results in many ways using packages that include those
formats.

Once data has been received, I know of no way in R that tags it with the
source of the data as being internal or external. Often the fact that
something is external is well hidden as many R packages have ways to access
external data as if it were local.

Perhaps you can explain more clearly what your concerns are. But note R is
not atypical among computer languages and many others might share the same
issues that concern you.

Dear Charity

Since your organisation is a member of King's Health Partners you might 
like to ask colleagues in KCL for local support.

There is OFTEN confusion what we mean when we say "R".

R is effectively a single bit of software with a ton of other bits of
software as optional extras.  You might think of some of those optional
extras like apps on a phone. You'd say you have a phone when you can open
the box and power it on. But you might add say "Spotify" app to it. That
will then be downloading the songs. And inevitably sending some data back
(I not do Spotify - no idea what - but it must have your identification and
what songs to play as a minimum).

R packages are like apps. They interact with the R core and do sometimes
amazing things. I think the majority do all that entirely on the machine
running R. BUT some may be using external services. There is for instance a
package that can interact with the Twitter API.  It would be impossible to
do that without sending as a minimum some login data and downloading data
back.  But you'd not normally send your entire research database to Twitter
during the login!

There will be SOME R packages that may be doing some odd stuff which might
need the dataset sent to the web. I can't think of any! Then there are
packages that could accidentally send data that you may or may not consider
sensitive. Say for instance you have a postcode list for every patient in
your research study. And you wanted to geocode that to get their location
as a long/lat... you can do that in an r package - which will have to send
the post code to get the answer. You haven't identified why you want the
postcode... but it is patient identifiable data...

That's R.

Add to that R Studio (or possibly other software solutions) - which is a
development environment which sits on top of R. It's often what people mean
by programming in R but it's effectively a glorified text editor. R Studio
desktop doesn't send data anywhere. Although it has database connectors
that could (but so can excel so if IG are flipping out feel free to remind
them of that!).

R Studio can work with git which is a version management system and can
upload code to a service like GitHub. You COULD upload data in that, or you
could chose not to.

And finally...

R Studio has a cloud version. It looks 98% the same as R Studio desktop.
Now called Posit.Cloud. That's a cloud service. While it may be secure etc
-- you are processing on their server not your PC.  And if this was your
question - it's a whole different set of answers!!


You may also want to Google NHSRcommunity where you might find help if
there are IG question to address as many of us will have wrestled with an
NHS IG team at some point.

Subject: [R] Problems Structuring My Data
Message-ID: <CAMOcQfPz8Yte9GmqX3daiRwcstonS6WKEFiUq2Aq3N5UzvzQnA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Hope you are all doing great. I am working with a dataset which is a subset
of the original one, that has the following columns: FAILDATE, REM_NAME,
and Days_At_Failure.

I want to structure the data in such a way that I have the unique FAILDATE
in "%Y-%m-%d" format, then a column for each REM_NAME and then the
Days_At_Failure displayed for each REM_NAME and FAILDATE (just as if I was
using a pivot table).

The structure I want is the following:
FAILDATE  REM1                 REM2  REM3 ........ REM N
2000-01-01 # days at failure ................................#days at
failure
2000-01-02 # days at failure ................................#days at
failure
2000-01-03 # days at failure ................................#days at
failure

Here is the dput() of my dataframe:
#I don?t know why R is showing the dates as numbers
#when I do str, it actually shows that FAIL date has type Date
 dput(head(failure_subset2, n=1000))
structure(list(FAILDATE = structure(c(17597, 17597, 17347, 17334,

I won't attempt to answer your post here, but:

#I don?t know why R is showing the dates as numbers

Please read the Help files!
You say FAILDATE has "type" = S3 class, "Date".
The first thing ?Dates tells you in the "Details" is:

"Dates are represented as the number of days since 1970-01-01, with
negative values for earlier dates. They are always printed following
the rules of the current Gregorian calendar, even though that calendar
was not in use long ago (it was adopted in 1752 in Great Britain and
its colonies)."

That answers your question without ever needing to post here.

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] Question about R software and output
In-Reply-To: <LO2P265MB2831D6E3A2BAFFC03EA8548CC9C5A@LO2P265MB2831.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>
References: <LO2P265MB2831D6E3A2BAFFC03EA8548CC9C5A@LO2P265MB2831.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

R is open source software, available from CRAN servers, but also
packaged for various Linux distributions.  On this machine,
running Ubuntu, R was installed using the 'apt' package manager.

R is a complete programming language with built-in support for
reading and writing over the network.  Packages -- whether on CRAN
or elsewhere -- extend R with code written in a mixture of Fortran,
C, C++, and R.  Base R behaves itself, but a package loaded from
some random GitHub site could do anything.

Data processed by R need not have been anywhere near Excel or any
kind of spreadsheet.  I don't even *have* Excel on any of the machines
I run R on.  Most of the data I process is not in .csv or .xslx format.
R is able to read data in many formats as described in the
R Data Import/Export
manual, which is fairly brief.  If there is a data exchange format
with a significant community, chances are there's an R package that
can read and/or write it.  Indeed, it is even possible to extract
information from PDFs in R using the pdftools package.

It sounds as though your primary concern is data protection, and
there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that if you stick
with R and with packages from a trusted repository, you're safe.
The bad news is that a programming language that can do anything
can do ANYTHING, and you are not safe from a malicious programmer
in your own organisation sending data anywhere she wants to.
% R
> system("some possibly dangerous command goes here")
Of course, this doesn't let anyone do something they couldn't already
do *without* R.

And this gets us to the real bad news.  I think you are trying
to achieve security by a method that cannot work.  You're trying to
limit yourself to safe software.  But you ALSO need to plug ALL the
USB ports, ALL the Thunderbolt ports, snip the wires to the Wifi and
Bluetooth modules, &c &c.  If a system is capable enough to install
R (or anything else), it is insecure *without* R.  You have to limit
the internet connections that can possibly be established by ANY
program, and that means several levels of firewalls.  It also means
no "work from home".

Subject: [R] Problems Structuring My Data

I'll make an attempt to answer your question, but the results seems
extremely wasteful, as there appears to be only one REMNAME for each
FAILDATE. This means for my "solution", almost all of the entries are
empty (NULL, actually). So I assume I must misunderstand your
specification, but maybe showing you my misunderstanding will help you
and/or others to clarify or it.

Anyway, calling the data frame you provided, d, my "solution" is
simply (I changed your variable names to fdate, name, and fdays to
save typing):

w <- with(d, tapply(fdays, list(factor(fdate), name), I))
## that's an I = "eye" at the end not an "ell"

w is a *matrix* of the fdays, with the rownames of the matrix your
dates, and the colnames your remnames.  The dimension of w is 640 x
43.  As I said, most of the entries are NULL.

If this *is* perchance what you want, then I suggest you stay with
your original data frame and rethink how to work with it more
efficiently. You should *not* be guided by imitating what one does in
Excel.

However, as is more likely, I've just misunderstood what you want, so
a bit of clarification might get you the answer you seek.

Bon chance.

Cheers,
Bert

What/how do I interact with the download.file with turning off the strict certificate revocation check in regards to download & update packages?
I clearly made an attempt at this, but failed miserably.

Trying to do this, reference FAQ-
2.18 The Internet download functions fail.
(c) A MITM proxy (typically in enterprise environments) makes it impossible to validate that certificates haven't been revoked. One can switch to only best effort revocation checks via an environment variable: see ?download.file.

Here's what help(download.file) has to say:

>>     On Windows with ?method = "libcurl"?, when R was linked with
>>     ?libcurl? with ?Schannel? enabled, the connection fails if it
>>     cannot be established that the certificate has not been revoked.
>>     Some MITM proxies present particularly in corporate environments
>>     do not work with this behavior. It can be changed by setting
>>     environment variable ?R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT? to
>>     ?TRUE?, with the consequence of reducing security.

Does it help to Sys.setenv(...) this environment variable before
downloading? If not, please provide your sessionInfo() and the full
error message.

> No change with True or False with R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT

Judging by the screenshot, it looks like you've set an R variable
R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT instead of setting an environment
variable using Sys.setenv:

 Sys.setenv('R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT' = 'TRUE')

(Use Sys.getenv to verify the result.)

For the next time, most people on the R-help mailing list would
probably appreciate it if you copied and pasted the text from the R
console instead of attaching screenshots.

Hello,

Kind regards,
Juel Briggs

Hello,
I am very sad to let you know that my husband Jim died on 18th September. I
apologise for not letting you know earlier but I had trouble finding the
password for his phone.
Kind regards,
Juel

Thank you for informing us. Jim was a remarkably patient helper of many lost R analysts. His efforts will be missed.

   This is sad news indeed.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_summary_by_maintainer.html

   lists Jim as the maintainer of clinsig, crank, eventInterval, 
plotrix, and prettyR.

 > library(packageRank)
 > packageRank(c("clinsig", "crank", "eventInterval", "plotrix", "prettyR"))
         date      packages downloads             rank percentile
1 2023-10-03       clinsig         1 14,454 of 18,024        0.0
2 2023-10-03         crank         2 11,344 of 18,024       22.8
3 2023-10-03 eventInterval         4  8,001 of 18,024       51.0
4 2023-10-03       plotrix     3,082    310 of 18,024       98.3
5 2023-10-03       prettyR        90  1,954 of 18,024       89.1

It seems that at least plotrix and prettyR would be worth rescuing ... 
volunteers ... ? (prettyR has 1 strong reverse dep, plotrix has many ...)

My sympathies for your loss.
Jim Lemon was a dedicated contributor to the R community and his answers 
were always welcome.
Jim will be missed.

Here's what help(download.file) has to say:

>>     On Windows with ?method = "libcurl"?, when R was linked with
>>     ?libcurl? with ?Schannel? enabled, the connection fails if it
>>     cannot be established that the certificate has not been revoked.

Does it help to Sys.setenv(...) this environment variable before downloading? If not, please provide your sessionInfo() and the full error message.

Colleagues,

I wish to create y-data labels which meet a criterion.

Here is my reproducible code.
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

above_92 <- filter(faithful,waiting>92)

ggplot(faithful,aes(x=eruptions,y=waiting))+
  geom_point(shape=21,size=3,fill="orange")+
  theme_cowplot()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 92)+
  annotate(geom="text",x=above_92$eruptions,y=above_92$waiting+2,label=above_92$waiting)

A bit of trial and error is required to figure out what number to add or subtract to above_92$waiting.

Is there a more efficient way to do this?

Another approach (still seems to require experimentation to get the value
'2') would be to replace the annotate() with

geom_text(data=above_92, aes(x=eruptions,y=waiting, label=waiting),
nudge_y=2)

At least this makes clear the reason for the magic number '2' in the code.

For details see
?geom_text

Hdello,

Yes, there is an automatic way of doing this.
Use a new data set in geom_text or annotate. Below I use geom_text.
Then vjust will take care of the labels placement.




library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

above_92 <- filter(faithful, waiting > 92)

ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) +
   geom_point(shape=21,size=3,fill="orange") +
   geom_hline(yintercept = 92) +
   # use a new data argument here
   geom_text(
     data = above_92,
     mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, label = waiting),
     vjust = -1
   ) +
   theme_cowplot()




Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Sorry to hear that! He has been very active answering questions on R. May
his soul rest in peace.

This looks like an RStudio issue; it might be better to post the question

Hello,

RStudio is an IDE for R, not R itself.
That is a RStudio error and RStudio technical support [1] is better 
suited to solve your problem.

Hope this helps,

Hi

You could use the 'gggrid' package, which gets you access to other 
coordinate systems.  For example, the following places the text labels 
2mm above the (centres of the) data points (bottom-justified) ...


library(gggrid)

labels <- function(data, coords) {
     textGrob(data$label,
              coords$x,
              unit(coords$y, "npc") + unit(2, "mm"),
              just="bottom")
}

ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) +
     geom_point(shape=21, size=3, fill="orange") +
     geom_hline(yintercept = 92) +
     grid_panel(labels,
                data = above_92,
                mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting,
                              label = waiting)) +
     theme_cowplot()


Hope that helps.

Paul

Subject: [R] Is it possible to get a downward pointing solid triangle
 plotting symbol in R?
Message-ID: <1166b665-5708-497a-9ab0-c9bf216946c2@psyctc.org>

The reason I am asking is that I would like to mark areas on a plot 
using geom_polygon() and aes(fill = variable) to fill various polygons 
forming the background of a plot with different colours. Then I would 
like to overlay that with points representing direction of change: 
improved, no reliable change, deteriorated. The obvious symbols to use 
for those three directions are an upward arrow, a circle or square and a 
downward pointing arrow.? There is a solid upward point triangle symbol 
in R (ph = 17) and there are both upward and downward pointing open 
triangle symbols (pch 21 and 25) but to fill those with a solid colour 
so they will be visible over the background requires that I use a fill 
aesthetic and that gets me a mess with the legend as I will have used a 
different fill mapping to fill the polygons.? This silly reprex shows 
the issue I think.

library(tidyverse)
tibble(x = 2:9, y = 2:9, c = c(rep("A", 5), rep("B", 3))) -> tmpTibPoints
tibble(x = c(1, 5, 5, 1), y = c(1, 1, 5, 5), a = rep("a", 4)) -> tmpTibArea1
tibble(x = c(5, 10, 10, 5), y = c(1, 1, 5, 5), a = rep("b", 4)) -> 
tmpTibArea2
tibble(x = c(1, 5, 5, 1), y = c(5, 5, 10, 10), a = rep("c", 4)) -> 
tmpTibArea3
tibble(x = c(5, 10, 10, 5), y = c(5, 5, 10, 10), a = rep("d", 4)) -> 
tmpTibArea4
bind_rows(tmpTibArea1,
 ????????? tmpTibArea2,
 ????????? tmpTibArea3,
 ????????? tmpTibArea4) -> tmpTibAreas
ggplot(data = tmpTib,
 ?????? aes(x = x, y = y)) +
 ? geom_polygon(data = tmpTibAreas,
 ?????????????? aes(x = x, y = y, fill = a)) +
 ? geom_point(data = tmpTibPoints,
 ???????????? aes(x = x, y = y, fill = c),
 ???????????? pch = 24,
 ???????????? size = 6)

Does anyone know a way to create a solid downward pointing symbol?? Or 
another workaround?

TIA,

Chris

Does adding

, show.legend = c("color"=TRUE, "fill"=FALSE)

to the geom_point do what you want?

Best,

Sadly, no.? Still shows the same legend with both sets of fill 
mappings.? I have found a workaround, sadly
much longer than yours (!) that does get me what I want but it is a real 
bodge.? Still interested to see
if there is a way to create a downward pointing solid symbol but here is 
my bodge using new_scale_fill()
and new_scale_color() from the ggnewscale package (many thanks to Elio 
Campitelli for that).

library(tidyverse)
library(ggnewscale) # allows me to change the scales used
tibble(x = 2:9, y = 2:9,
 ?????? ### I have used A:C to ensure the changes sort in the correct 
order to avoid the messes of using shape to scale an ordinal variable
 ?????? ### have to say that seems a case where it is perfectly sensible 
to map shapes to an ordinal variable, scale_shape_manual() makes
 ?????? ### this difficult hence this bodge
 ?????? c = c(rep("A", 5), "B", rep("C", 2)),
 ?????? change = c(rep("Deteriorated", 5), "No change", rep("Improved", 
2))) %>%
 ? ### this is just keeping the original coding but not used below
 ? mutate(change = ordered(change,
 ????????????????????????? levels = c("Deteriorated", "No change", 
"Improved"))) -> tmpTibPoints
### create the area mapping
tibble(x = c(1, 5, 5, 1), y = c(1, 1, 5, 5), a = rep("a", 4)) -> tmpTibArea1
tibble(x = c(5, 10, 10, 5), y = c(1, 1, 5, 5), a = rep("b", 4)) -> 
tmpTibArea2
tibble(x = c(1, 5, 5, 1), y = c(5, 5, 10, 10), a = rep("c", 4)) -> 
tmpTibArea3
tibble(x = c(5, 10, 10, 5), y = c(5, 5, 10, 10), a = rep("d", 4)) -> 
tmpTibArea4
bind_rows(tmpTibArea1,
 ????????? tmpTibArea2,
 ????????? tmpTibArea3,
 ????????? tmpTibArea4) -> tmpTibAreas
### now plot
ggplot(data = tmpTib,
 ?????? aes(x = x, y = y)) +
 ? geom_polygon(data = tmpTibAreas,
 ?????????????? aes(x = x, y = y, fill = a),
 ?????????????? alpha = .5) +
 ? scale_fill_manual(name = "Areas",
 ??????????????????? values = c("orange", "purple", "yellow", "brown"),
 ??????????????????? labels = letters[1:4]) +
 ? ### next two lines use ggnewscale functions to reset the scale mappings
 ? new_scale_fill() +
 ? new_scale_colour() +
 ? ### can now use the open triangles and fill aesthetic to map them
 ? geom_point(data = tmpTibPoints,
 ???????????? aes(x = x, y = y, shape = c, fill = c, colour = c),
 ???????????? size = 6) +
 ? ### use the ordered variable c to get mapping in desired order
 ? ### which, sadly, isn't the alphabetical order!
 ? scale_shape_manual(name = "Change",
 ?????????????????? values = c("A" = 24,
 ????????????????????????????? "B" = 23,
 ????????????????????????????? "C" = 25),
 ?????????????????? labels = c("Deteriorated",
 ????????????????????????????? "No change",
 ????????????????????????????? "Improved")) +
 ? scale_colour_manual(name = "Change",
 ?????????????????? values = c("A" = "red",
 ????????????????????????????? "B" = "grey",
 ????????????????????????????? "C" = "green"),
 ?????????????????? labels = c("Deteriorated",
 ????????????????????????????? "No change",
 ????????????????????????????? "Improved")) +
 ? scale_fill_manual(name = "Change",
 ?????????????????? values = c("A" = "red",
 ????????????????????????????? "B" = "grey",
 ????????????????????????????? "C" = "green"),
 ?????????????????? labels = c("Deteriorated",
 ????????????????????????????? "No change",
 ????????????????????????????? "Improved"))

That gives the attached plot which is really what I want.? Long bodge 
though!*

You are right, sorry.

Another possible solution then: use geom_text instead of geom_point and 
use a triangle shape as text:

ggplot(data = tmpTibPoints,
        aes(x = x, y = y)) +
   geom_polygon(data = tmpTibAreas,
                aes(x = x, y = y, fill = a)) +
   geom_text(data = tmpTibPoints,
              aes(x = x, y = y, label = "?", color = c),
              size = 6) + guides(color = FALSE)

Another thing that I considered, but doesn't seem to be supported, is 
rotating the symbols. I noticed that that does work with text. So you 
could use a arrow symbol and then specify the angle aesthetic. But this 
still relies on text and unfortunately there are no arrowlike symbols in 
ASCII: except perhaps 'V'.

I can't say how the support for non-ascii text is over different OS-es 
and localities. 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Encoding-issues 
gives some 'hints'

Hello,

Maybe you can solve the problem with unicode characters.
See the two scale_*_manual at the end of the plot.



# Unicode characters for black up- and down-pointing characters
pts_shapes <- c("\U25B2", "\U25BC") |> setNames(c("A", "B"))
pts_colors <- c("blue", "red") |> setNames(c("A", "B"))

ggplot(data = tmpTibAreas,
        aes(x = x, y = y)) +
   geom_polygon(data = tmpTibAreas,
                aes(x = x, y = y, fill = a)) +
   geom_point(data = tmpTibPoints,
              aes(x = x, y = y, color = c, shape = c),
              size = 6) +
   scale_shape_manual(values = pts_shapes) +
   scale_color_manual(values = pts_colors)

Doesn't the outcome of this suggestion still depend on which fonts and output device you are using? ... and that is to some degree still system dependent...

Jim always went beyond just posting answers. He helped me along in 
learning R, always showing solutions together with insightful 
explanations. His patience and good humor were remarkable.

Condolences to his family.

This is only FYI for those who care to follow the link below.

Explanation: Many questions that appear on this list are about how to
organize and format data -- unsurprising, as data structures are an
essential component of software and algorithm development in general,
and data science in particular. Those who are interested in such
queries and/or  the related area of reproducible research may find the
stupefying mess that biologist microscopists have to contend with to
be of interest:

That list is _very_ low volume... most employers who would benefit from the skills of an R user don't know that R exists.

Well, for those some years older it would certainly help not to use 
words such as "gigs" (I first assumed gigabytes of data were meant). 
Apparently the original poster is looking for some employment, but we do 
not even know the country nor what the capabilities are.
Honestly, given that mail message, I would not even offer to supervise 
any voluntary tasks.
My personal classification was "spam", hence not replying to the OP.

Best,

Subject: [R] Confirming MySQL Alive
Message-ID: <21cebfe8-465f-c3aa-d71d-d1ae8b7886b5@shdawson.com>

Hi,


Getting some data from an older MySQL box. I had an event recently where 
the MySQL box went off-line for maintenance without a prior announcement 
of service disruption.

I decided to add a line on my local version of MySQL as I considered how 
to handle this condition going forward.

system("sudo systemctl status mysql", input = 
rstudioapi::askForPassword("sudo password"))

system("sudo systemctl status mysql",input=readline("Enter Password: "))


Both fail for the same reason, saying I need a terminal.


 > system("sudo systemctl status mysql", input = 
rstudioapi::askForPassword("sudo password"))
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S 
option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
 >



 > system("sudo systemctl status mysql",input=readline("Enter Password: "))
Enter Password: ***REDACTED***
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S 
option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
 >



I can run the code segments for things like ls and pwd. So, there is 
something unique about systemctl and R that is beyond my understanding 
today.

QUESTIONS
What is so special about systemctl and R in a system syntax statement?

What are some of the best practices to confirm a box I am hitting for 
data with R , either local or across the network, has MySQL up and running?


Thanks,

SO helpful. Thanks to all.? I _think_ the answer to Jeff's question may 
be "It should only be problematical on R earlier than 2.10". At least,
that's how I read this:

There is a portable way to have arbitrary text in character strings 
(only) in your R code, which is to supply them in Unicode as ?\uxxxx?
escapes (or, rarely needed except for emojis, ?\Uxxxxxxxx? escapes). If 
there are any characters not in the current encoding the parser
will encode the character string as UTF-8 and mark it as such. This 
applies also to character strings in datasets: they can be prepared
using ?\uxxxx? escapes or encoded in UTF-8 in a UTF-8 locale, or even 
converted to UTF-8 /via/ |iconv()|. If you do this, make sure you have
?R (>= 2.10)? (or later) in the ?Depends? field of the DESCRIPTION file.

(Quoting from 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Encoding-issues. 
Thanks for that pointer Jan.)

Not really an R question, but some processes are connected to interactive terminals (where someone can type) and some are not (because they were created and managed by another process). The system call creates a process and controls all interactions with that process. You really should not be messing with sudo in the background like that.

Thanks, Jeff.

So, how do you know in your work if the box you are hitting for data is 
alive in the moment?

sudo is giving you a hint here. Normally it requires an interactive
terminal (that it can set up to disable character echo), but if you
give it the -S flag, it will be happy to read the password from stdin.

Wrap (a copy of) the connection code in try() or tryCatch() and see if
it fails.

If the MySQL DBI driver doesn't have a timeout option and can hang
indefinitely, you can try R.utils::withTimeout (implemented using
setTimeLimit(), so requires the DBI code to be interruptible / check
for interrupts). Alternatively, on a GNU/Linux box there's the timeout
utility (see `man 1 timeout`) that you could use together with the
`mysql` command-line client to try to establish the connection. Failing
everything else, there's socketConnection() to check whether anything
is listening on a given address and TCP port (but not for a UNIX domain
socket you would normally use to connect to the local server).

Beware of the time-of-check to time-of-use problem: a particularly
unlucky program could see a working MySQL server and then have it fail
later when it actually tries to work with it.

Hm, I suspect PDF output will be important to to some users, probably including myself, so if that won't handle this then I think I probably will go for the clumsy but seemingly usable workaround using ggnewscale at least for now.?

You don't need sudo to run:
systemctl status

Subject: [R] Text showing when R is launched

Good Evening,

I was wondering if you were able to help, I am running R on MacOS, it is the 2020 model mac so have install the Intel arm of R which I believe is correct

However when I launch R or resume the R window after going on a different programme the following text is running

I have also copied and pasted for ease

Are you able to inform me what is causing this? I can't seem to find any online help regarding this

Thankyou in advance,

Subject: [R] olsrr and substitute lm -> lmRob
Message-ID: <CAC8=1epOq24cAP9hUoHgLvxbecP7+aWTUw9+7uHHnCatz8B2HQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I wish to use backward selection from the package olsrr.
?ols_step_backward_p
This gives me a model of class lm.
I wish to then run lmRob from the robust package on the SAME variables
ie I want to substitute lm -> lmRob in the function call which created
the lm model.

Here is a reprex:
----------------------------------------------------------------
library(olsrr)
library(robust)

myformula <- lm(mpg~.,data = mtcars)

# This is how I do backward selection.

chosen.model = ols_step_backward_p(myformula,details=F)

# Chosen model

chosen.model$model

# Not sure if this is the correct thing to do

lmRob(chosen.model$model)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

My query is : is the above correct ? Do I need to do some meta
programming and substitute lm with lmRob ?
I am not sure how I would do that in this context using the
?substitute function perhaps ?

Many thanks,
Ashim

Do you have anything valuable stored in /Users/admin/.RData? Does the
message disappear if you move the file away?

If you don't get your problem solved here, try asking at
R-SIG-Mac at r-project.org.

Thank you for doing that! This is exactly the right thing to do.

Hello,

Try deleting file

/Users/admin/.RData


It is restoring the previous session and this is many times a source for 
problems.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] Problem with compatible library versions
Message-ID: <0ced8135-94f8-4b8a-bbc3-14d664545753@iap.ch>

On the github website I have reported several bugs with new versions of 
the tidyverse group (probably dplyr) which prevent me from using R 
normally. I wanted to go back to older versions but this seems not bo be 
easy. I downloaded R 4.1.2. and Rtools 40 but the library versions 
installed are still the newest ones. I was able to install dplyr 1.0.7. 
manually but there are error messages on incompatibility when loading 
this version. Is there a possibility to load older library versions 
which alre compatible ?

Thank you very much!

Best regards

Sabine Braun

So this is on Windows.

Actually, if you install R-4.1.2 and use a clean library and install 
binaries, then you should get binary installation from CRAN that fit to 
the R-4.1.x series.

If you want to install older package versions, then you have to install 
these one by one from sources, unfortunately.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

There is a fairly straightforward way to load older versions
of packages, and that is to use the 'groundhog' package.
As the first sentence of https://groundhogr.com/ puts it:
   Make your R scripts reproducible by replacing library(pkg)
   with groundhog.library(pkg, date).

pkg can be a vector of package names or a single name.

Is that a method where a program that I write today would still run without changes in 10 years?

No.

In 10 years you may have different hardware and a different OS, so that 
the old R and old packages won't run on the new hardware or produce 
different results. This may even happen for some sort of containers and 
virtualizations.

To be really safe, you ideally need to keep the whole system as is (but 
then there are security updates etc).

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Hello,

Look at the screenshot attached to your original post. RIght before the 
red text there are two lines:

[Workspace restored from /Users/admin/.RData]
[History restored from /Users/admin/.Rapp.history]


It's the first of these two, the .RData line that you want.
Close R, delete that file and restart R to see if the error persists.

(Since it's a file starting with a period it may not appear in a 
directory listing.)

If this doesn't solve the problem, maybe try the R-SIG-Mac [1] list.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

?

However this is all that exists in Users/Admin

There were a couple of R files in there which I have since deleted but I am still getting the same issue

Thankyou,
George

Hi.
I have successfully performed the discriminant analysis with the lda
function, I can classify new individuals with the predict function, but I
cannot figure out how the lda results translate into the classification
decision. That is, I don't realize how the classification equation for new
individuals is constructed from the lda output. I want to understand it but
also, I need to communicate it and provide a mechanism for other colleagues
to make classifications with their data.
Thank you very much,
Fernando

   It's possible that neither of these will help, but

(1) you can look at the source code of the predict method 
(MASS:::predict.lda)

(2) you can look at the source reference ("Modern Applied Statistics in 
S", Venables and Ripley) to see if it gives more information (although 
it might not); there's a chance that you can get the information you 
need via a google books search

Hi,

Following expression returns only the first element

ifelse(T, c(1,2,3), c(5,6))

However I am looking for some one-liner expression like above which
will return the entire vector.

Is there any way to achieve this?

What a strange question... ifelse returns a vector (all data in R is vectors... some have length 1, but length zero is also possible, as are longer vectors) that is exactly as long as the logical vector that you give it, filled with elements from the respective positions in the vectors supplied in the second and third arguments. Because your logical vector is length 1, you only get a vector with the first element of the second argument.

If you want to choose between one of two vectors considered wholly, then "if" is what you need:

result <- if (TRUE) c(1,2,3) else c(5,6)

Hello,

I don't like it but


ifelse(rep(T, length(c(1,2,3))), c(1,2,3), c(5,6))


maybe you should use


max(length(c(1, 2, 3)), length(5, 6)))


instead, but it's still ugly.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Do you want to know the principles of the theory behind LDA? That is 
available in lots of textbooks.

Do you want the implementation detials of MASS::lda()?
That is hard. It is based (but does not follow in all details) on a 
paper by Nils Hjort from Norway.
A former student of mine, Swetlana Herbrandt, has analysed and reverse 
engineered the code and wrote down the theory in a German thesis. The 
implementation uses some nice tricks to get numerically rather stable 
results that are typically not mentioned in any textbook.

Do you really want to do prediction with LDA?
I typically look at classificatuion performance of LDA as a reference to 
compare better and more modern techniques with.

I think you should ask some trained local statistician for advise on 
both, the LDA theory and for prediction in general.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

The purpose of 'groundhog' is to support reproducible research.
As Uwe Ligges pointed out, there are practical limits to that.
Since I am typing this on a 10-year-old machine, it's clearly
feasible in *some* instances, but as an illustration of Uwe's
point, Ubuntu still supports 32-bit applications, but it does
not support 32-bit x86 hardware (since 20.04 IIRC).

I think it is fair to say that 'groundhog' *supports*
reproducible research, but nothing can *guarantee* it.

?ifelse
'ifelse' returns a value with the same shape as 'test' which is
     filled with elements selected from either 'yes' or 'no' depending
     on whether the element of 'test' is 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'.

This is actually rather startling, because elsewhere in the
S (R) language, operands are normally replicated to the length
of the longer.  Thus
    c(1,2,3)*10 + c(5,6)
first (notionally) replicates 10 to c(10,10,10)
and then c(5,6) to c(5,6,5), yielding c(15,26,35).
And this *does* happen, sort of.
> ifelse(c(F,T,F), c(1,2,3), c(5,6))
=> 5 2 5.
But it *doesn't* apply to the test.

There's another surprise.  Years ago I expected that
all three arguments would be evaluated, then length
adjusted, and then processing would be done.
But the 2nd argument is evaluated (in full) if and only
if some element of the test is true,
and the 3rd argument is evaluated (in full) if and oly
if some element of the test is false.
ifelse(c(NA,NA), stop("true"), stop("false"))
=> c(NA,NA).

At any rate, what you want is if (<test>) <tp> else <fp>

The code is lifted directly from the document btw it?s not mine

This bit to convert gives an error message:

osg_parse(gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem = "WGS84")

 # Option b: from OS grid reference to BNG

osg_parse(gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem = "BNG")

##

osg_parse seems to be built into the rnrfa package so I don?t know why it
doesn?t work?




Then this bounding box code works but doesn?t seem to capture any stations
although rubric says that it should capture stations in mid Wales - the
tibble is empty

# Define a bounding box.

bbox <- list(lonMin = -3.76, latMin = 52.43, lonMax = -3.67, latMax = 52.48)




The ggmap code following gives an error ? this may be because the bbox data
is empty but I?m not sure  The needed packages are loaded:

library(ggmap)

library(ggrepel)

m <- get_map(location = as.numeric(bbox), maptype = 'terrain')

ggmap(m) + geom_point(data = someStations, aes(x = lon, y = lat),

                        + col = "red", size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +

geom_text_repel(data = someStations, aes(x = lon, y = lat, label = name),

                    + size = 3, col = "red")




I thought that I?d try the next bit to see anyway:

# Select stations with more than 100 years of recordings.

s100Y <- catalogue(minRec = 100, all = FALSE)

# Print s100Y to the screen.

s100Y

But again I get an error message

I haven?t gone any further through the article because there doesn?t seem
much point unless I can sort things.  I am puzzled as to why the examples
don?t work ? I?ve got all the needed packages loaded etc

If anyone can help/explain I?d be v grateful

Thanks Nick Wray

When reporting problems, it's best to list (1) your actions, (2) their
expected result and (3) their actual result:
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

In particular, it's best to report error messages together with the
code that causes them. This is what I get:

osg_parse(gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem = "WGS84")
# ?????? ? osg_parse(gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem = "WGS84") :
#   ???????????????? ????????? (gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem =
#   "WGS84")

Presumably, your error message looks a bit differently, but the
underlying cause is the same: the package has evolved since the R
Journal article has been published. In particular, the argument names
have been changed in 2018 with a giant commit commented "lint free":
https://github.com/ilapros/rnrfa/commit/258f11d89726c1031cb5bfa73e2f819d984914f3#diff-acbd0646da1333775e213e83567eaf53cb9e791ff7ba1200d462005e65fd7694L24-R30

I think you can use the argument name grid_refs instead of gridRef
and coord_system instead of CoordSystem:

osg_parse(grid = "NC581062", coo = "WGS84")
# $lon
# [1] -4.404049
# 
# $lat
# [1] 58.02222

Same goes for your catalogue() problems, which can be easily resolved
by calling help() on the respective functions to look up their new
argument names.

Is this the error you get?

>> Error in `get_googlemap()`:
>> ! Google now requires an API key; see `ggmap::register_google()`.

Does it help to follow the instructions in help(register_google,
package = ggmap)? Google inflected this change on the world in 2018,
approximately 1.5 years after the article had been published.

OpenStreetMap support is broken in ggmap
<https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap/issues/117>, but passing the source =
'stamen' argument to ggmap::get_map seems to work. Well, partially. I
also get half an error message rendered right into the map telling me
something about "these basemap[s]... no longer... as of October..." and
asking me to upgrade by visiting stamen.com.

This is more or less inevitable when a package depends on an external
service to keep providing map data (you can't bundle the whole map of
the world into a CRAN package, after all), so unless someone steps up
and implements OpenStreetMap's stable API support in ggmap, your best
bet is to ask Google for an API key and pray they won't alter the deal
any further.

Thank you very much :-)), this worked! Now the loaded libraries are 
compatible with each other.
