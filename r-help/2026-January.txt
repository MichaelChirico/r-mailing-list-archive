Hi Rich,

I have not used the extension, but just want to provide some archive
links in case you're not aware of them.

The Internet Archive has a snapshot of the R Extension for MediaWiki
page (the first "R" link in the MediaWiki URL you sent). The most
recent non-404 snapshot is from Oct 8, 2017:
https://web.archive.org/web/20171008070533/https://mars.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/mediawiki/sk/index.php/R_Extension_for_MediaWiki

That page in turn links to the R-sig-mediawiki mailing list, which was
active from August 2006 to December 2008:
https://web.archive.org/web/20110924042440/https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mediawiki/.
It seems that the messages sent to the list weren't saved with the
capture.

Regards,
Jeff

If so, then you could offer the new code to MediaWiki with documentation on why it's valuable and how to use it. I could help you develop post tutorials to an internal NASA Wiki on how to use it. Then if MediaWiki executives agree to maintain it after you have it work, I will happily help you port the tutorials to Wikiversity ;-)

Earlier this year the WMF discontinued the Graph extension and is in the process of transitioning to a new conceived replacement extension called "Charts" that aims at doing the same thing as "Graph", but with greater granular control over the of the data and plot configurations of plots used in WMF projects like Wikipedia.

I think the data visualization capability of the Charts extension could be vastly increased and availability accelerated if the community would simply utilize "R" as a chart generating service, rather than build one from scratch that will take years to do what R does today.  All that said. If I can get a working example of what the "R" extension provided as recently as 5 years ago, I think I can "show them" what is possible in R today.

Indeed;  thank you, Mikael, and also Leo Mada, Ben Bolker, Richard O'Keefe.
And yes, clearly a buglet.

Yes, R's bessel{IJKH}() algorithms are not perfect, even when
based on published code/algortithms  and have already been
tweaked to be more "robust" than the original code.

This "imperfectness" where the main reason I had created the
{Bessel} CRAN package  ( https://cran.R-project.org/package=Bessel )
a long time ago in order to provide alternative algorithms -
notably to work with *complex* 'x',  but also to explore pure R
code implementations of asymptotic approximations, (almost?)
always related to  |x| -> oo   or  |nu| --> oo   ("oo" = `Inf`).

The case here,  |nu| --> 0 , is a new not-yet reported
bug which should be addressed and fixed.
Note that the Bessel's package versions do not seem to suffer
from the problem here.

I'm looking into fixing this,
a first good step is probably to just set nu=0  when |nu| is too
small, but I have to first find, i


but you (readers) could help well
by exploring the  nu -> 0  case over "all" x  instead of just
x = pi/2.  (notably large x).

Also, I've just experienced my first really positive interaction
with an LLM,  starting from mathoverflow / stackoverflow, ending
here:

In any case, thank you once more for the report!

This should be fine on wikis that only trusted people can write, but
otherwise will need very careful consideration. R is a little too
powerful; it was not designed to be a security boundary.

Much like ImageMagick needs to be carefully tuned (see
/etc/ImageMagick*/policy.xml) to avoid resource exhaustion attacks from
images that are compressed too well (does anyone want an 1e6 by 1e6
bitmap?), image formats that are Turing-complete (PostScript) and plain
vulnerabilities in rarely-used decoders, an R microservice would need
to be protected to prevent arbitrary code execution attacks somehow.
The "forbidden commands" approach [1] is inadequate: yes, eval() is
forbidden, but an attacker can still construct new calls and stash them
into other objects whose methods call eval() for them [2].

The problem is compounded by the fact that for best plot output, the R
plugin would need both arbitrary code execution (because plots are
described in code) and third-party packages (e.g. 'latticeExtra', or
the whole 'ggplot2' ecosystem). Managing an R library of packages is
not hard, and neither is running child processes confined to a
temporary, read-only sandbox, but it's not the kind of maintenance that
MediaWiki administrators are used to.

Error in inherits(1.2, class_numeric) :

**class_numeric is an S7 union, not an S7 base class ?**

So if 1.0 is not class_double, what base class is it? And how should I test
for the class of a non-integer numeric? And what is class_double then?

My apologies if this is obvious, but as I said, I find this confusing.

Subject: [R] Search and chat interface for R-help and R-devel
Message-ID: <b7019875-b000-4f41-87ef-21fa17364083@gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I'm excited to announce R-help-chat, a search and chat interface for the R-help and R-devel mailing lists. The app is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/jedick/R-help-chat.

The backend is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system with LLM invocation at two steps: first the LLM analyzes the user's question to construct a search query, then it uses the retrieved emails to generate a response. The search tool is a hybrid of semantic search (vector embeddings) and lexical search (keyword search using a version of BM25).

The system supports multiple searches in a single turn (useful for comparing different topics or time periods) and chat memory for asking follow-up questions with previous conversational turns as context.

The retrieved emails are shown in the app below the chatbot. Note that preprocessing removes quoted lines (beginning with ">") to reduce redundancy in the database and the search tool is configured to return up to six emails per search. Citations for the LLM's response are also shown.

The app itself is free software and the source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jedick/R-help-chat). However, the LLM it currently uses is a commercial product from OpenAI. I have enabled sharing of inputs and outputs with OpenAI to access complimentary daily tokens.

Further regarding privacy and logging, I do not have access to server logs for the deployed app. I collect usage information with print statements like this:

2026-01-05T01:23:42 - Set R-help graph for session lrs8onnysyl
2026-01-05T01:24:04 - Get graph for session lrs8onnysyl
2026-01-05T01:56:38 - Delete graph for session lrs8onnysyl
2026-01-05T01:56:41 - Set R-devel graph for session lrs8onnysyl
2026-01-05T01:57:07 - Get graph for session lrs8onnysyl
2026-01-05T01:57:19 - Get graph for session lrs8onnysyl
2026-01-05T02:29:38 - Delete graph for session lrs8onnysyl

The session is a random identifier for page visits. The "Set graph" and "Get graph" logs denote the start of a chat and input to an existing chat and the "Delete graph" log occurs when the user changes the mailing list or closes or browses away from the page.

The email database covers the R-help and R-devel list archives from January 2015 to December 2025. I plan to make monthly updates to the database. I'm open to suggestions about adding other lists or longer time periods and welcome any other feedback.

I hope this will be a useful tool for list subscribers and the wider R community.

Regards,
Jeff Dick

I don't believe this is the reason why it's giving an error. The first 
example in

vignette("classes-objects", package = "s7")

defines an new class Range with two properties, start and end, both of 
class class_double.

Apparently, 1.0 has no S7 class (?)


library(S7)

S7_class(1.0)
#> NULL
x <- 1.0
S7_class(x)
#> NULL
nameOfClass(x)
#> NULL


This is all I can say, I have no explanation nor solution.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

It's documented that

   inherits(1.0, class_double)

should execute

   inherits(1.0, "double")

because nameOfClass(class_double) is "double".	So things are consistent 
because you found

   inherits(1.0, "double") == inherits(1.0, class_double)

And nameOfClass(class_numeric) is NULL, because the S7 authors haven't 
given a way for an S7 union to have an S3 class name.

So I think you are right to be confused, but the only solution I can 
think of (allowing S7 unions to have S3 names) might be seen as just too 
much trouble.  Are there any other cases where an S7 union corresponds 
to an S3 class?

Thanks, Duncan (and Rui).

This is basically what I "concluded" in my post; but my grasp of such
things is shaky, at best, so I thought I may have missed something more or
less obvious.

Perhaps also worth noting is:

> is.numeric
function (x)  .Primitive("is.numeric")

so that my whole notion of a numeric constant in the language having a
*formal* class is probably misguided/dumb to begin with. It only "works" in
S3 due to S3's informal nature, as ?new_S3_class alludes. But the clash of
names that you note certainly threw me.

Best,
Bert

Dear R-packages community,

I would like to announce the release of a new R package, AssociationExplorer2, now available on CRAN.

AssociationExplorer2 provides a user-friendly Shiny application for exploratory analysis of associations in multivariate datasets. It supports both quantitative and qualitative variables and automatically selects appropriate association measures (Pearson?s r, Cramer?s V, and correlation ratio). Results are presented through an interactive correlation network and bivariate visualizations, making the package particularly suitable for exploratory data analysis, teaching, data journalism, and public communication.

An accompanying paper describing the methodology and design of the package has been published in SoftwareX:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2025.102483

CRAN page:
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=AssociationExplorer2>https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AssociationExplorer2<https://cran.r-project.org/package=AssociationExplorer2>

Source code and documentation:
https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/AssociationExplorer2

I hope this package will be useful to the community, and please feel free to contact me if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Best regards,
Antoine Soetewey
