Dear R-Users,

Is there a quick solution to plot colours based on a variable?

I tried something like this:

library(nlme)

plot(BodyWeight)

# Does NOT work!
colDiet = c(2:4)[BodyWeight$Diet]
plot(BodyWeight, col = colDiet)

# Wastes space
rat.fit = lme(weight ~ Time + Diet, data = BodyWeight, random = ~ Time|Rat)
plot(rat.fit, weight ~ Time | Rat + Diet)

Is there a quick way to base the colour on the Diet variable?

Many thanks,

Leonard

   plot(BodyWeight, ...)

dispatches to plot.nfnGroupedData(), which uses lattice::xyplot() 
graphics rather than base graphics. I don't know lattice well enough to 
answer your question, but maybe this will give you a hint...

   I often find custom-built lattice-based plot methods inscrutable and 
end up falling back to figuring out how to get what I want directly with 
lattice.

   I haven't figured out how to get the label 'Diet' on the legend, but 
otherwise this works pretty well ...


library(lattice)
library(nlme)
labs <- paste(attr(BodyWeight, "labels"),
               attr(BodyWeight, "units"))
xyplot(weight ~ Time | Rat, type = c("p", "r"),
        data = BodyWeight,
        layout = c(NA, 1),  ## enforce 1 row
        groups = Diet,
        auto.key = TRUE,
        pch = 19,
        xlab = labs[1],
        ylab = labs[2],
        par.settings = list(superpose.line = list(col = "black")))

The documentation suggests that this might work, but the colors come out
weird.

plot(BodyWeight, innerGroups = ~Diet)

or aspect = "xy", as in the plot method.

A more direct analog of plot(BodyWeight) would be

xyplot(BodyWeight, weight ~ Time | Rat,
       aspect = "xy", type = "o",
       groups = Diet, auto.key = list(title = "Diet", columns = 3),
       grid = TRUE, xlab = labs[1], ylab = labs[2])

Dear Ben,

Thank you very much for the suggestion. Indeed, it works.

Many thanks to Duncan and Deepayan for the other suggestions, as well.

I managed to add the legend title (figured out that legend is named "key"). The code looks like this (though the pch, fill & type-options do not work yet, and as much as I fiddle with them, I don't get them set):

library(lattice)
library(nlme)
labs <- paste(attr(BodyWeight, "labels"),
               attr(BodyWeight, "units"))
xyplot(weight ~ Time | Rat, type = c("p", "r"),
        data = BodyWeight,
        layout = c(NA, 1),  ## enforce 1 row
        groups = Diet,
        auto.key = list(title = "Diet", pch = 16, type = "n", fill = 0.6),
        pch = 19,
        xlab = labs[1],
        ylab = labs[2],
        par.settings = list(superpose.line = list(col = "black")))

The code provided by Deepayan is much shorter; although the colours are not the best choice.

Sincerely,

Leonard

Dear Vaclav,

Thank  you very much for the suggestion.

I tried to avoid this plot, because it wastes a lot of space. Each of Diet 1, 2 and 3 are visualised on separate rows, with the remaining row empty.

Ben and Deepayan provided some working code. Some fine details still need to be improved, but both versions work well otherwise.

Regarding the image: I wanted to add some nice images to a lecture - a wrap up of the statistics module for medical residents. As doctors do not know a lot of statistics, good images can convey the knowledge much better. I wanted to give them some overview of mixed-effects models and some other (more) advanced topics. Funnily, mid through the lecture I tried to have them recount what variance was; only to learn that they are a new batch of residents and this was their first class.

Unfortunately, I am not familiar with lattice. And the terminology used through the documentation is sometimes confusing as well.

Your suggestion to change the colours may be useful to someone, so I am adding it to the discussion thread.

Many thanks,

Leonard

Hello,

I need to provide the simplest possible indication to R users with either windows or macos machines on how to change working directory. Using setwd() will not work because I cannot trust them to even understand the concept of working directory.

On macos it is possible to have a GUI menu (the standard R GUI) that would allow the users to "click their way to where their data files are", is there such facility for the windows R GUI (the out-of-the-box one)? I have no access to windows machines, so I cannot check, but I am sure some people will use a windows laptop.

Dear Federico

If they click on File in the top left hand corner and then Change dir in 
the drop-down menu if opens a file explorer type window where they can 
click on directories (folders in MS-speak) in the usual way. That does 
not get round the problem that they need to know where they put the file 
in the first place of course but it might help some of them.

People who use computers should understand file names. It does not matter if you call them folders or directories they are the same animal.
I have a file called "my_file"
Where does it live? "On my computer" is like saying my mailing address is "Earth." 

All files have a memory location in your computer where the computer can find the file contents. All names consist of two, but more commonly three parts: location, name, type. These answer "where is the file," "what is it called," and "what kind of file?" The format for location is disk drive followed by an ordered list of (directories or folders) from outer to innermost. I am on Windows, so for me this looks like c://dir1/dir2/dir3/. In words, I look on my hard drive named "C" and will find a directory called dir1. Inside dir1 will be dir2 and inside that will be dir3 where I can find my file.

File names typically end with a period followed by the type of file. .xlsx for an Excel file, .txt for a text file, .csv for comma separated values file, docx for a Microsoft word file. Most of the time on Windows the extension is hidden, and the path is shown at the top of the window. This was all very obvious in the old days working with DOS, but windows made things "easy" and took this away from the default output. In any case, files are all saved something like this: "c://dir1/dir2/dir3/my_file.docx". 

I have multiple projects in R. I could change the working directory in R multiple times each day and try to keep up. I am bad at that. My solution is that I never change the working directory, so all read and write statements include the full file name, path and all. I can then switch between projects and not worry about where to read or save things and I do not sometimes get files saved in strange places. One could set the working directory at the start of each program, but that assumes that I want to always start working at the top of each program. I have not had much luck with that approach.

I sometimes write software for others to use. In this case I give users a popup window where they select their file using a graphical interface and then the program extracts the path from where the user got the file. This path is then added to the file name the user provides to save output. In this way I do not have to worry about the difference between "c://dir1/dir2/dir3/my_file.docx" and "c:\\dir1\dir2\dir3\my_file.docx"

Hello,

I need to provide the simplest possible indication to R users with either windows or macos machines on how to change working directory. Using setwd() will not work because I cannot trust them to even understand the concept of working directory.

On macos it is possible to have a GUI menu (the standard R GUI) that would allow the users to "click their way to where their data files are", is there such facility for the windows R GUI (the out-of-the-box one)? I have no access to windows machines, so I cannot check, but I am sure some people will use a windows laptop.

As much I might agree with you in theory, people here are just using R to produce some graphs using one line of code I generated, so they can do the job they are paid to do (which is not computing). Producing said graph and its permutations would be more complex in any other way, and I want to make sure the instructions I printed out for them are as simple, accessible, and require the least amount of supervision.

People who use computers should understand file names. It does not matter if you call them folders or directories they are the same animal.
I have a file called "my_file"
Where does it live? "On my computer" is like saying my mailing address is "Earth."

All files have a memory location in your computer where the computer can find the file contents. All names consist of two, but more commonly three parts: location, name, type. These answer "where is the file," "what is it called," and "what kind of file?" The format for location is disk drive followed by an ordered list of (directories or folders) from outer to innermost. I am on Windows, so for me this looks like c://dir1/dir2/dir3/. In words, I look on my hard drive named "C" and will find a directory called dir1. Inside dir1 will be dir2 and inside that will be dir3 where I can find my file.

Files come from somewhere. Where do the files you are referring to come from? Where will it go after you are done with it?

Most of the time files that inexperienced users deal with come from downloads using a web browser, and most of the time they are directed into a Downloads folder. Whether you use that or the desktop, if the files build up over time then that group of similar files will get larger without bound. Will you support deleting the files once you are done with them?

R can read files from a URL directly almost as easily as it can from a directory. Can you make R aware of that location? 

If you have another program generating the file, can you have it put it into an agreeable place? If so, a temporary directory or filename may be sufficient, since the OS will clean that out occasionally (though cleaning up after yourself is a better solution.

Jeff,

users will get the files they need to fill in on Teams, and will save them wherever they like. They will need to use R for image creation, but they are not trained for computing so they know where their stuff is, but I do not mean to expect they can use setwd() to set the working directory, or start with concepts such as working directory. Now they have the option of clicking their way to their files, they have been told their outputs will be next to those, and that is it.

I have work to do, I do not run a circus. My users have now the ability to run the scripts I wrote for them, get the images they need without the need for direct support, and we can go forth and get the stuff we get paid to do done. Sorry if using R as a tool for work offends.

If they are going to run a script which you have prepared for them then 
they can click on File and then click on Source R code which opens the 
same Explorer type window but only shows runnable files.

 From the responses you are getting I think most people on this list do 
not come into contact with people who are so ignorant of computing 
basics. They are fortunate.

Now they have the option of clicking their way to their files, they have been told their outputs will be next to those, and that is it.

This sounds more like there are some hourly employees that you do not want to train but they need to produce a graph for you. In this case I would use a package in R called Shiny to create an app. The worker opens the app, types in the file name and the app sends you the graph. The employee will never see the R code. This level of use in Shiny is about as basic as it gets. It costs you time to learn Shiny basics, but it will save you time in not having to train employees. If written properly, the employee only needs to know how to find their data file (which probably should be saved in your company TEAMS folder, and not some personal computer).

An R user writes code (good or bad but writes code) and therefore does computing. It sounds like your employees would not qualify as R users and you want to keep it this way. Lock the R code in a Shine app and you do not have to worry about any of this.

As much I might agree with you in theory, people here are just using R to produce some graphs using one line of code I generated, so they can do the job they are paid to do (which is not computing). Producing said graph and its permutations would be more complex in any other way, and I want to make sure the instructions I printed out for them are as simple, accessible, and require the least amount of supervision.

People who use computers should understand file names. It does not matter if you call them folders or directories they are the same animal.
I have a file called "my_file"
Where does it live? "On my computer" is like saying my mailing address is "Earth."

All files have a memory location in your computer where the computer can find the file contents. All names consist of two, but more commonly three parts: location, name, type. These answer "where is the file," "what is it called," and "what kind of file?" The format for location is disk drive followed by an ordered list of (directories or folders) from outer to innermost. I am on Windows, so for me this looks like c://dir1/dir2/dir3/. In words, I look on my hard drive named "C" and will find a directory called dir1. Inside dir1 will be dir2 and inside that will be dir3 where I can find my file.

File names typically end with a period followed by the type of file. .xlsx for an Excel file, .txt for a text file, .csv for comma separated values file, docx for a Microsoft word file. Most of the time on Windows the extension is hidden, and the path is shown at the top of the window. This was all very obvious in the old days working with DOS, but windows made things "easy" and took this away from the default output. In any case, files are all saved something like this: "c://dir1/dir2/dir3/my_file.docx".

I have multiple projects in R. I could change the working directory in R multiple times each day and try to keep up. I am bad at that. My solution is that I never change the working directory, so all read and write statements include the full file name, path and all. I can then switch between projects and not worry about where to read or save things and I do not sometimes get files saved in strange places.

Hello,

I need to provide the simplest possible indication to R users with either windows or macos machines on how to change working directory. Using setwd() will not work because I cannot trust them to even understand the concept of working directory.

On macos it is possible to have a GUI menu (the standard R GUI) that would allow the users to "click their way to where their data files are", is there such facility for the windows R GUI (the out-of-the-box one)? I have no access to windows machines, so I cannot check, but I am sure some people will use a windows laptop.

SORRY if I missed such a discussion somewhere on R-HELP

For many years I wanted to write an R function that finds the closest pair of
points among a, maybe huge, set of points on the 2-dimensional plane. I never
did, perhaps considering the possible complexity of this task.

Now I found a book, among others describing the "sweeping algorithm", perfectly
suited for the problem. And as a test, I questioned chatbots like DeepSeek and
ChatGPT about such a function - and mentioned the sweeping algorithm.

DeepSeek, for instance, came immediately up with a complete, efficient solution
and test cases that I checked with brute force. I can see that it utilized the
sweeping algorithm, documented the code, and set up a help file. I made some
changes, improved the code a bit, but still it is code generated by a clever
chatbot, whatever I do.

Now I ask myself: Is this a correct and lawful way to write code in the future?
I am not even sure DeepSeek may not have used an implementation of the sweeping
algorithm that is under ACM license and would not be allowed on CRAN.

I wonder how one handles this matter? Will this be the future of code writing
(for R and other languages)? I would really appreciate to hear your opinion or
a hint to a discussion about it.

Technically, one needs to ensure they know what is occurring throughout
that code.  E.g. one should know what is happening when a multuline
procedure in their own code comes out in a lambda function style from a LLM.

There is also an ethical element about which ones you used based on
supporting the success in the market of a given LLM's ideological
viewpoints.

Claude's terms of service specifically forbid machine learning outputs
which is basically most of the good statistical analysis you could do.
Deep Seek has serious things to consider if you talk to it, so my opinion
would be to get coding help from Mistral LLMs.

Humans who don't adapt to LLMs, or whatever form AI takes as it evolves, will be left in the dust.

People may just now be waking up to the fact that we're three years into a tremendous revolution, one of the greatest in human history. It follows the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Industrial Revolution, the computer revolution, the Information Age, and now... AI.

AGI is approaching. How quickly? Who can say. Whether AI can ever be truly sentient remains a mystery. But once it can adequately replicate sentience, some will ask: what's the difference?

As to the question of who judges what's acceptable from a coding standpoint: capitalism will. Corporations will. And the question of whether this is the future of coding is already behind us. It is coding now, and it will only continue to improve in capability.

Try Replit, Cursor, Claude Code. Humans are incapable of keeping up. AI still struggles with some of the most complex tasks, and it does poorly at orchestrating across large repositories, but it's improving rapidly.
Just my observations. 


Those who look down their noses at all this will be left behind.

All the best!
Gregg

It seems like malpractice to recommend Claude to someone using R or big
data since what they would use it for is *explicitly* against the terms of
service.  Machine learning predates the microchip.

See below.

Also, quality control will make a comeback.  Expert systems cannot be
replaced with something akin to Bayes probability charts indedinitely.

you may not use the service to ?develop any products or services that
compete with our Services, including to develop or train any artificial
intelligence or machine learning algorithms or models.?

Claude?s terms further state

?*Equitable relief.* You agree that (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if
you breach Section 3 (Use of Our Services); (b) it would be difficult to
determine the damages resulting from such breach, and any such breach would
cause irreparable harm; and (c) a grant of injunctive relief provides the

There are issues with chatbots in terms of what they allow and how they were trained. Kind of like walking into a mine field.
That said chatbots are useful tools. You can muddy the waters by writing your own code but have the chatbot help you with specific sub-tasks that you then assemble into a working program.
Always check the chatbot "answer." Chatbots often assume things or don't assume things thereby being very certain that their wrong answer is what you want. You can easily spend as much time correcting the chatbot as you would writing the program yourself. That said, the chatbot can provide an answer that works but is not how you would have written the program.

On many occasions I have had the chatbot state "Here is the fully functional code ..." only to find that it does not run at all.
Chatbots lie but do so with conviction!

It seems like malpractice to recommend Claude to someone using R or big data since what they would use it for is *explicitly* against the terms of service.  Machine learning predates the microchip.

See below.

Also, quality control will make a comeback.  Expert systems cannot be replaced with something akin to Bayes probability charts indedinitely.

you may not use the service to "develop any products or services that compete with our Services, including to develop or train any artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms or models."

Claude's terms further state

"*Equitable relief.* You agree that (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if you breach Section 3 (Use of Our Services); (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from such breach, and any such breach would cause irreparable harm; and (c) a grant of injunctive relief provides the best remedy for any such breach. You waive any opposition to such injunctive relief, as well as any demand that we prove actual damage or post a bond or other security in connection with such injunctive relief."

Agreed Timothy. LLMs are still of limited utility from a coding standpoint. But - they DO provide utility. Think how poorly LLMs coded 3 years ago - compared to today. They are an order of magnitude better now. I was not a programmer by trade. I needed to produce code to make tools, clean data, conduct analysis, and perform tasks - LLMs have made that increasingly easier. I am more productive. Clearly, I am not a purist - this attitude is anathema to some.

best,
Gregg

Hello,

I'm having a problem running R on the system described above.  R informs
the message below,

Error: package or namespace load failed for ?TTR? in dyn.load(file, DLLpath

It seems the issue is on the /usr/lib/libssl.48.dylib that doesn't exist.
I appreciate suggestions to solve this problem for R was working fine up to
today.

I did not say blindly trust LLMs nor did I recommend their use. That is up to each individual.?
Those who choose not to use LLMs will not be competitive against their peers who do - that is my claim.

As for me, I use LLMs.? ?I have no axe to grind against using LLMs or those who use them. Honestly, at 58 - I did not think I'd see AI in my lifetime. I see LLMs as a tool. A very useful tool. I would not want to be a younger person having to compete against AI. I am glad to be in a position where AI and its impact on society will have little or no financial impact on me personally. I commiserate with those not in a similar circumstance. I see many taking a supercilious attitude toward those who use AI (as demonstrated in your emails, for instance) - particularly among coders. Ironically, coders are among the first and hardest hit by AI, along with graphic designers, writers, researchers, data scientists... there is a long and growing list.

The genie is out of the bottle. Governments are run by people either too greedy or power hungry to curtail the technology. It is the start of a new arms race. Some claim it will help society, other claim it will destroy it. As most things usually go - the truth most probably lies somewhere in the middle. Only time will tell.

All the best!
Gregg?

You agree that (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if you breach Section 3 (Use of Our Services); (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from such breach, and any such breach would cause irreparable harm; and (c) a grant of injunctive relief provides the best remedy for any such breach.

So to summarise, there are three key issues so dar:
- does the generated code work
- does it infringe on someone else?s intellectual property rights
- do the AI?s terms of service permit you to use it

What are some other things people who want to use an AI to generate code
should consider?  Ither than the application domain,?is any of this
specific to R?

A good summary. At the level of the summary it is not specific to R. However, asking a chatbot "I want a program to analyze my data" will not result in anything useful. You have to phrase the question to let the chatbot know what language, what does the data look like, and what do you want to do. So I might write: I have a data frame with three variables where V1 is time. I want an R program to calculate the mean of V3 for each unique value in V1. The answer will be R specific. The chatbot may guess at missing elements including generating fake data to act as an example. In "does the generated code work" the quality of the end result depends on the quality of the question asked. The chatbot works best with tightly focused simple questions. Complicated problems require complicated prompts and chatbots often ignore parts of long prompts. Developing good prompts is also a learned skill.

I would add
- is it worthwhile?

It takes time to write code. It also takes time to develop a good prompt. In both cases there will be a code validation and debugging step. What is the most efficient use of your time? What gives the best final product?

I might ask will you learn from it? The chatbot gave you an answer that you could not write yourself when you asked the chatbot. Given the chatbot answer do you understand it and could you now get that answer yourself?
The chatbot wrote: if(!require(tidyverse){install.packages('tidyverse')}
    And explained the solution. I understand, and this helps to avoid installing packages that are already installed. You can take it further and say: I have a program that requires 30 packages. In R, what is the shortest code that will check to see if they are already installed and to install ones that I do not have?

I get several answers, one of which is:
pkgs <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "lme4")
to_install <- pkgs[!pkgs %in% rownames(installed.packages())]
if (length(to_install)) install.packages(to_install)

I can then copy the code and ask the chatbot to explain the code, and progress from there.
If the chatbot is generating black boxes where "a miracle occurs" they will in the end cause you more problems than they solve. If all the code is generated by a chatbot and you do not understand it, what will you do when the boss stops by as asks for a modification or enhancement or a customer stops by and states that your code generates errors?

Hi,

Just a few thoughts from me.

It is important to understand how large language models (LLMs) actually work.

At a high level, an LLM is a prediction system: it generates the most statistically likely next piece of text based on patterns learned from its training data. While web-search tools can be added to retrieve recent information, the model is still fundamentally summarizing and recombining existing content. Any output must therefore be independently evaluated.

This underlying mechanism also explains why LLMs struggle with complex tasks, particularly in advanced programming and scientific problem-solving. In my own experience, while using one of the latest models for code optimization, the system produced confident but incorrect outputs ? in other words, hallucinations. When pushed beyond pattern-matching into true reasoning, its limitations became obvious.

LLMs cannot replace critical thinking. They are not conscious, do not possess understanding, and do not ?think? in the human sense. They generate tokens based on probability distributions, not insight or intent. Suggesting otherwise raises an important philosophical question: is human thinking merely probabilistic? That seems unlikely. We still do not fully understand how the human brain works, and assuming we can faithfully replicate it without that understanding is a significant leap.

While LLMs can assist in writing basic applications or accelerating routine tasks, they are not capable of building genuinely complex systems independently. Claims that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is imminent should be treated with skepticism. AGI would imply the ability to reason, understand, and generalize across domains ? effectively, to think. Until we understand our own cognition, true simulation of it remains speculative.

There is also a real societal risk: overreliance on AI by those who fail to develop or maintain critical thinking skills. Used uncritically, these tools can weaken reasoning rather than enhance it. AI should therefore be used responsibly, as an aid to human judgment ? not a substitute for it.

Finally, it is worth asking who is driving much of the AI hype, and why. Often, it is large technology companies and their executives, whose incentives include boosting valuations and shaping investor expectations. Fear-based narratives ? suggesting people or businesses will be ?left behind? ? are powerful psychological tools for creating perceived urgency and value.

This is precisely why strong critical thinking skills are essential: to separate realistic capabilities from marketing narratives, and to avoid being passively swept up in technological hype.

Regards,
Dillon

I did not say blindly trust LLMs nor did I recommend their use. That is up to each individual. Those who choose not to use LLMs will not be competitive against their peers who do - that is my claim.

As for me, I use LLMs.   I have no axe to grind against using LLMs or those who use them. Honestly, at 58 - I did not think I'd see AI in my lifetime. I see LLMs as a tool. A very useful tool. I would not want to be a younger person having to compete against AI. I am glad to be in a position where AI and its impact on society will have little or no financial impact on me personally. I commiserate with those not in a similar circumstance. I see many taking a supercilious attitude toward those who use AI (as demonstrated in your emails, for instance) - particularly among coders. Ironically, coders are among the first and hardest hit by AI, along with graphic designers, writers, researchers, data scientists... there is a long and growing list.

The genie is out of the bottle. Governments are run by people either too greedy or power hungry to curtail the technology. It is the start of a new arms race. Some claim it will help society, other claim it will destroy it. As most things usually go - the truth most probably lies somewhere in the middle. Only time will tell.

All the best!
Gregg

Thanks all for your answers.

It seems most of my students understand that the way to compute a small probability may impact the result.

I believe there's a key misunderstanding here: The statement that the z-test does not depend on the number of cases is incorrect. The p-value of the z-test is ?just like other tests? very much dependent on the sample size, assuming the same mean difference and standard deviation.

LLMs are not intuitive. A+B always equals C. There is no other possible answer. LLMs are probabilistic. If you are living in the average LLMs will work very well for you. If you are odd, weird, and otherwise unusual they will have a reduced efficacy. However, LLMs are often better at brute force. I could not remember what 5000 programmers wrote in the last year but if the LLM has access then it can. As long as we keep building computers and linking them together it will never have a problem like "my brain is full" (as in a 1986 Far Side cartoon). So what a human might consider an unusual request might be common within the population of 5000 programmers.

Hi,

Just a few thoughts from me.

It is important to understand how large language models (LLMs) actually work.

At a high level, an LLM is a prediction system: it generates the most statistically likely next piece of text based on patterns learned from its training data. While web-search tools can be added to retrieve recent information, the model is still fundamentally summarizing and recombining existing content. Any output must therefore be independently evaluated.

This underlying mechanism also explains why LLMs struggle with complex tasks, particularly in advanced programming and scientific problem-solving. In my own experience, while using one of the latest models for code optimization, the system produced confident but incorrect outputs - in other words, hallucinations. When pushed beyond pattern-matching into true reasoning, its limitations became obvious.

LLMs cannot replace critical thinking. They are not conscious, do not possess understanding, and do not "think" in the human sense. They generate tokens based on probability distributions, not insight or intent. Suggesting otherwise raises an important philosophical question: is human thinking merely probabilistic? That seems unlikely. We still do not fully understand how the human brain works, and assuming we can faithfully replicate it without that understanding is a significant leap.

While LLMs can assist in writing basic applications or accelerating routine tasks, they are not capable of building genuinely complex systems independently. Claims that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is imminent should be treated with skepticism. AGI would imply the ability to reason, understand, and generalize across domains - effectively, to think. Until we understand our own cognition, true simulation of it remains speculative.

There is also a real societal risk: overreliance on AI by those who fail to develop or maintain critical thinking skills. Used uncritically, these tools can weaken reasoning rather than enhance it. AI should therefore be used responsibly, as an aid to human judgment - not a substitute for it.

Finally, it is worth asking who is driving much of the AI hype, and why. Often, it is large technology companies and their executives, whose incentives include boosting valuations and shaping investor expectations. Fear-based narratives - suggesting people or businesses will be "left behind" - are powerful psychological tools for creating perceived urgency and value.

This is precisely why strong critical thinking skills are essential: to separate realistic capabilities from marketing narratives, and to avoid being passively swept up in technological hype.

Regards,
Dillon

I did not say blindly trust LLMs nor did I recommend their use. That is up to each individual. Those who choose not to use LLMs will not be competitive against their peers who do - that is my claim.

As for me, I use LLMs.   I have no axe to grind against using LLMs or those who use them. Honestly, at 58 - I did not think I'd see AI in my lifetime. I see LLMs as a tool. A very useful tool. I would not want to be a younger person having to compete against AI. I am glad to be in a position where AI and its impact on society will have little or no financial impact on me personally. I commiserate with those not in a similar circumstance. I see many taking a supercilious attitude toward those who use AI (as demonstrated in your emails, for instance) - particularly among coders. Ironically, coders are among the first and hardest hit by AI, along with graphic designers, writers, researchers, data scientists... there is a long and growing list.

The genie is out of the bottle. Governments are run by people either too greedy or power hungry to curtail the technology. It is the start of a new arms race. Some claim it will help society, other claim it will destroy it. As most things usually go - the truth most probably lies somewhere in the middle. Only time will tell.

All the best!
Gregg

One of the things that has really simplified things for my students is 
using RStudio to run R, and then always creating (working within) an 
RProject.

The location of the RProject becomes the default location (home folder) 
for all related files in the project.? It dispenses with having to teach 
the students too much about absolute and relative paths, and it is very 
flexible in the sense that you can move a folder from one drive to 
another or from one computer to another, and things still work as long 
as you start R (RStudio) with the same project selected.

I had no end of agony with "path confusion" before using this approach.

I reply as a passive observer and not one with insight or advice. So
certainly no need to respond.

I am just amazed that in this day and age students of any sort in higher
education institutions of any sort have difficulty understanding the basics
of (the tree structure of) file organization on any sort of computer. I
suspect that this reflects my profound ignorance of how most of today's
young people have interacted with the manifold computational resources that
they use every day through brilliantly crafted UI's. Still, I would have
assumed that such knowledge would be basic to any "higher education" these
days. Silly me...

Cheers,
Bert

My wife was a returning college student 10 years ago, and her stories to me of her upper division engineering students coping with files and Excel corroborate this deficiency. She was rather more computer-literate than average, but was still apprehensive about piling R on top of her engineering workload at that time. She later did a Master's and finally started using R and has expressed regret that she did not start using it sooner... but I meet engineers all the time who can barely use Excel much less a scripting language.

I suspect that ubiquitous GUI programs create a conceptual gap with text-based programming and hierarchical thinking. People are able to skim by all their lives without ever having to organize information.. just type in questions to Google... so why should they start now?

I gave up when I started encountering people who thought computer literacy was how to use Word and Excel.

[External Email]

My wife was a returning college student 10 years ago, and her stories to me of her upper division engineering students coping with files and Excel corroborate this deficiency. She was rather more computer-literate than average, but was still apprehensive about piling R on top of her engineering workload at that time. She later did a Master's and finally started using R and has expressed regret that she did not start using it sooner... but I meet engineers all the time who can barely use Excel much less a scripting language.

I suspect that ubiquitous GUI programs create a conceptual gap with text-based programming and hierarchical thinking. People are able to skim by all their lives without ever having to organize information.. just type in questions to Google... so why should they start now?
