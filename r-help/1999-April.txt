Subject: [R] "dump" Splus -> R
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.04.9903311354020.14356-100000@localhost>


Hi All,

I just used "dump" on Splus to transfer a pile of survival objects from
Splus 3.4 on Solaris 7 to R 0.63.3 on Intel. 

The only trick is that survival objects contain an element holding the
original call that generated the object.  When Splus writes these out, it
doesn't mark them in any way, so when R tries to read them in, it ends up
trying to reevaluate the call.  Not nice.  

Anyway, as all but one** of the offending calls occur in statements
that look like
   [...], call = func( param1, param2, [..] ), class = "myclass"

so I wrote the following perl script to encapsulate each call in 
as.call(expression(...)) :

-------begin translate.dump.pl--------
$RS="<-";
$OS="<-";

while(<>)
  {
        s/call\s*=(.*?),(\s+?)class/call=as.call(expression($1)),$2
class/s;
        print $_;
   }
---------end translate.dump.pl----------

Now the data can be transfered by :

   Splus on Unix:
   > dump(ls())

Downloading the resulting "dumpdata" file.

   Linux shell:
   $  translate.dump.pl < dumpdata > dumpdata.fixed

   R on Linux:

   > source("dumpdata.fixed")

Just thought this might help someone out...


-Greg 


**The only exception was the ".Last.warning" object, which contained
something like 
  structure( "Warning Message" = offending(call) )

I just tried dumping and sourcing/restoring an "lm" object under
Splus-3.4, it doesn't work there either!  This is very nasty indeed.

We can fix the problem in R by inserting quote() around call objects,
when we deparse, but what about Splus?

It seems like you may want to design your scripts to provide a
solution to the problem in both platforms.

I think it is a good idea to put "substitute" (the synonym for quote)
around the call objects when deparsing.  Splus restores correctly with
the calls encapsulated in a substitute(...), as does R. 

I suppose I should submit a bug report to MathSoft and ask them to fix
thier deparse as well...

If R is fixed, I can create a "dump.correct" for S which calls perl
directly to fix things up.  Then dump/restore will work everywhere.

BTW, can we have 

	restore _ function(...) source(...)

in base, so that the a user looking for restore doesn't have to figure out
that source can be used instead?

Whoah! Watchit. Substitute is *not* a synonym for quote. 

>  (function(){a<-5;substitute(a+b)})()
5 + b
>  (function(){a<-5;quote(a+b)})()
a + b

function(x)
substitute(x)

(in Splus *and* R)

I do suggest you try NTemacs 20.3.1.  There is support for rw0633 in
ESS 5.1.3 and later, but I find 5.0 also works: you just need to set
--ess rather than --no-readline.  This is actually in the readme and
in rw-FAQ.

I think ESS Qs will get a better response from the ess list: Tony Rossini
will I am sure tell you more, including where to get help. I am no ESS
expert, but I was the one who add ESS support to R for Windows.

Which version of ESS?  In general, I believe you need NT Emacs 20.3 or
higher for decent interprocess communication (as opposed to editing).

In the more recent versions of ESS, look in the doc/ subdirectory for
information on how to deal with Microsoft "operating systems".

As stated in the documentation, please send questions about ESS to
	ess-help at stat.math.ethz.ch 
where they will tend to get more complete answers.

Message-ID: <3D89204A1FF7D011AB5500A0C9664801920FCB@CORONADO>

To Whom It May Concern:

Thanks in advance for any assistance.

I am trying to fit a linear mixed effects model to a reliability
degradation data set for a light emitting diode (the dependent variable
is the normalized output power, and the there are two independent
variables: the age of each device and the forward injection current). I
have linearized the model by taking logarithms of the independent and
dependent variables. There are 48 individual UNITS that are allocated
two three different CURRENT values. For each UNIT there is an NPOWER
reading at various TIMEs. The total number of observations is 332. I
have had no problem fitting models of the form,

Log(NPOWER) ~ log(TIME) + log(CURRENT), ..., random = ~ 1 + log(TIME) |
UNIT (where UNIT is the grouping variable)

I get into trouble when I try to add a random effect for log(CURRENT).
When I try to fit this model my PC runs for several minutes and then
issues a warning that the application has performed an illegal
operation. I have included the fault information at the end of this
message.

I would be very grateful for any hints. I have tried allocating more
memory ( --vsize 30M) to no avail. I do not know what is going on.

Here are some specifics about my version of the software and hardware:

> version
           _

arch       x86

year       1999      
month      March     
day        6         
language   R

I am using the version of lme that is in the CRAN contributed binaries
folder for WIN95/NT

Package: lme Version: 2.9-4

I am using an IBM ThinkPad 600.

I would really like to have someone try my troublesome model with my
data on a UNIX box to see if this is a PC-specific problem. If someone
can help, I would be glad to email the data set.

Call step(), print the anova component of the result is the usual way.

Subject: [R] Joe Shafer's imputation packages
Message-ID: <3705878D.7FA7215B@info.com.ph>

Joe Schafer has some imputation libraries in S plus, and
one of them is even on stand alone for Windows.

Has anybody attempted to write these very useful packages in R?

Subject: [R] spectrum function in R?
Message-ID: <EBPMIMKAEAKBAAAA@hotbot.com>

Dear R users,

Is there a function/library in R that can be used
to compute the spectrum of a time-series?
Ideally I would like sth. that does the same
as spectrum function in Splus.
Are there any good time-series libraries
that you recommend using with R.

Thank you very much for your time.

Hi

Sometimes (and I haven't yet found out what causes it) I get a message:

Warning: ingnored non-function "t"

I think it may be either when I have done a Ctl-C to break in or I may
have inadvertently named a variable after one of the many system or other
functions.  I have seen names other than "t".

Anyway, the only way I can get rid of it is to exit and restart.  I don't
think it causes any problems but has anyone else seen it and how to avoid?

I am running 0.63.3 from the CRAN rpm on RH5.2

Yes, t is indeed a system function, namely the one to get the
transpose of a matrix. The above warning says that you use symbol t
where a variable is needed, hence the function is ignored and the
variable used. But in general it is safer to avoid name conflicts like
those.

An easy way to check things like that (after seeing the warning) is to
start a new R process (without restoring an old namespace) and simply
type (in yor case) `t ENTER':

	R> t
	function (x) 
	UseMethod("t")

which gives you the definition of object t (a function).

Another obvious way is checking if there's any help for the name
(``help(t)'').

Hope this helps,
Fritz

   As you suggest, this happens when you've named a variable after a
system function ("t" and "c" are the most common culprits).  All you have
to do is remove the offending variable using rm(t) or rm(c); of course, if
you need that variable you probably want to copy it somewhere.
  R usually does the right thing under these circumstances, it's just
warning you.

  This should probably go in a FAQ list somewhere: I get this question
from students frequently.  Or perhaps (?) the warning message could be
usefully extended to 'ignored non-function "t"; type rm(t) to remove', or
even 'ignored non-function "t"; help("conflicts") for more information'
(where this basic information was provided in a help file).

Subject: [R] rw-faq clarification + simple question + bug(?)
Message-ID: <B7F24F2B48ACD11196F600805FC7F430062AEA@pdc.rc.liv.ac.uk>

Windows users note: the rw-faq says

|1.8) Can I use rw0xx with ESS and emacs?
|
|Yes. Some time soon versions of ESS (5.1.3 has a `somewhat rough'
|prototype for rw0632) will come with support for this version of R. If
|yours does not, edit essd-r.el to have
|
|    (inferior-ess-start-args       . "--ess"))
|
|and make sure you give the full path to Rterm.exe as the R executable.
|(You can add other flags like --vsize 10M after -ess.)

However, if you want to use iESS edit object and many other functions in
the iESS dropdown menu, you must also first edit the distributed file
[ess-path]/lisp/essd-r32.el to reflect the pathname for your
installation of Rterm, and then before calling M-x R you MUST first
issue

M-x load-library RET essd-r32

This will become automatic in future releases of ESS, but I don't know
when that will be.

Now a simple question: I added --vsize 64M --nsize 1000000 options, but
I only get

> gc()
         free  total
Ncells  90030 200000
Vcells 224652 262144

Have I hit a limit or is the command actually ignored? When I give these
options to Rgui I get

> gc()
          free   total
Ncells  890030 1000000
Vcells 8351116 8388608


Finally, there seems to be a bug/incompatibility between rw0633 and
ess-5.1.3. It is necessary to edit out the default addition of
--no-readline within essd-r.el (at least if you don't want a warning
every start-up). I have just quickly edited

;  (let ((r-start-args  (concat "--no-readline "
  (let ((r-start-args  (concat ""

but suspect a lot of this code section is redundant now.

Incidentally, what's the problem with interfacing the cygwin bash? In
rw0632/ess despite the warnings I could use system('set') no problem.
Now it says 'set not found'. I can still do

> system('uname -a')
CYGWIN_NT-4.0 STATS 20.0 (0.1/1/1) 1998-11-2 05:59:57 i686 unknown

(I resolved my dilemma as to whether this is an ess or R report by
writing to both lists. Apologies to those who get this twice.)

Sorry - my previous message applies only to ESS-5.1.3. If you still use
5.0 I think you will not get the problem.

Incidentally I have since noted that *any* error (e.g. object not found)
is fatal under 5.1.3 unless you load the essd-r32 library.

Thanks for your comments.

First, get ESS 5.1.6 (or 5.1.7 if it's out).  Some of the roughness is now
gone.  Part of the difficulty in 5.1.3 is that it was written for rw0632 and
the later rw0633pre fixed the R side of the problems.

Also, with 5.1.6, essd-r32 is obsolete.  It is merged into the R function and
should work out-of-the-box.

the bash problem was with rw0632.  The R folks fixed that in 63.

5.1.7 is out.  BUT, it might break because of a missing pause.  5.1.8
is in the process of code cleaning (as soon as I finish off a protocol

I'd like to clean up the documentation before I release 5.1.8, but
that might just wait for 5.1.9, if it's urgent enough.

Message-ID: <B7F24F2B48ACD11196F600805FC7F430062AF0@pdc.rc.liv.ac.uk>

Having just upgraded to 063.3 reminds me of a wish I have had for a long
time. Could we not have libraries (sorry, packages) other than for the
base distribution in a subdirectory [Rpath]/library/local/ or perhaps
/library/packages.

This tiny change would make administration so much simpler; I could move
all the old packages into the new library in one fell swoop. Granted
it's not hopelessly difficult to copy new onto old with overwriting and
then move the old to the new, but with a system that looks set to
continue to need frequent upgrades it would be really nice not to have
to do all this. 

Plus it does make generally good sense to keep add-ons separate from a
base package.

Same in Splus of course but I've given up on that.

There is an ongoing democratic decision-making process about this.  What
I want to have is

	R_HOME/R_VERSION/...
	R_HOME/R_VERSION/library/
	R_HOME/site/...
	R_HOME/site/library/

I might add this soon after 0.64 is out ...

But for now you can achieve what Simon wants easily. Just set RLIBS (in one
of many ways) or (for the brave) .lib.loc in your .Rprofile.  I have all my
R packages in /ext/R/library, for example, used by all the four versions of
R running here. I have

.lib.loc <- c("/ext/R/library", .Library)

in my .Rprofile, but Kurt says don't try that at home.

With S-PLUS you just set lib.loc in frame 0 in your or the startup script.

One little snag: what you need installed in a library changes from time to
time, including at 0.64.

BTW: I do use library correctly here: R packages are installed as subdirs
of a library as I understand it. (Those subdirs are `sections' in S
parlance and I think `packages' in R parlance. I'd vote for `shelves'
myself.)

  Could you try to execute Rterm outside ESS (i.e., in a dos or bash 
  window)? Doing that I get exactly your Rgui numbers and so I suspect
  that problem is in the way Rterm is called. But, please, if you
  have a minutes repeat the test on your machine.

  On the contrary, this is rw not ESS. 'system' is changed in rw0633
  and now, as noted in the man page (?system), has no shell behind.
  Now, 'set' is an internal command so you have to invoke it
  using
   system("command /C set",show=T)
  or
   system("bash -c set",show=T)

  In rw0633, there is also a new 'shell' command (written by
  Brian Ripley) which provide a more natural interface to thing
  as set. Indeed,
  shell("set")
  works (and automatically remaps to one of the two forms before
  if it knows which shell you like - try ?shell to see
  the details).  
  BTW, if people try 'system' and 'shell', I will like to know
  what name they prefer. Probably, 'shell' is more near to
  the Unix system so, perhaps, it can be the base
  of the Windows 'system' with the actual system 
  renamed to something like system.helper. 
  In any case, 'shell' will remain for S+ compatibility.

Many thanks to all who took the time to point out the blindingly obvious!

I frequently use single letters in various languages for short-term
(sometimes local to a function) variables.  In fact my Fortran
indoctrination still leads me to be uncomfortable with any loop counter
other than i-l!  This had only rarely happened and didn't appear to do any
damage.

So, as an entry to the wish-list, since R handles it correctly, wouldn't
it be better to suppress the warning message - via an option statement.
After all t() is clearly different to t[ ] or t so the context should be
able to determine what is really wanted.  (Mind you, I wouldn't go as far
as Algol68, where if I remember clearly, a legal command would be: if if
then then else else := if not then do else end!) 

Perhaps options(sloppy=TRUE)?

As a second entry to the wish-list, would it be possible to set an option
that ensured vector lengths were strictly matched?  I find that whenever I
drop a booboo and have mismatched vector length, the warning message
indicates that I have indeed done something wrong.  At the moment, I can't
conceive of a situation when an operation on two vectors where one is not
the same length as the other *or* one is effectively a scalar (vector
length 1) can be a legal statement.  Maybe some library functions do
assume this, in which case the user (or function) could store the option
an switch it off during the body.

Perhaps options(vector.match=TRUE)?

Since I don't use S+, I don't know what they do but S+ is not the oracle
anyway.

As it was doing, of course.  All you were getting was a warning
message, which to my mind is not a bad idea.  If you did use t
for a function name (and if you use it as a variable name, why
not a function?) you would probably find that some vital system
function was suddenly and mysteriously broken.

There are many situations where quite sensible programming does
make use of the recycling rule to good advantage, but I agree
that there are few (if any) cases where you need it when the
lengths are not strictly proportional.  For example consider a
calculation like finding a correlation matrix (if there were not
a built-in function to do it, I know):

V <- var(X)
SD <- sqrt(diag(V))
R <- t(V/SD)/SD

Compare the last step with the operations and memory use in

R <- diag(1/SD) %*% V %*% diag(1/SD)

a style many people do adopt.  Of course if V is very large,
transpostion is not a trivial operation, either.

    John> Since I don't use S+, I don't know what they do but S+
    John> is not the oracle anyway.

The latest version of S (version 4) outlaws vector arithmetic
with vectors of non-proportional sizes.

I think S (if not S+) is a bit of an oracle, too, by the way, and
going against the fundamental design is something that should be
done with great caution.  There is a lot of occluded wisdom in S.

Hi,

I am using 0.63.2 on Windows. I have some functions
programmed to do repetitive tasks and have some
print(variables) statements to check how my program is progressing
but get no output on screen (console) while the program is running.
I tried CTRL-W as the help says but I get no screen output
before each run terminates. Probably some kind of setting needs to be
predefined correctly.

Any clues ?

Best,

The intention in a future version of R to warn only if the object
which is masked is of the same mode ("function" here). This was decided
a couple of weeks ago, but we needed to get R-0.64 out first.

Subject: [R] library
Message-ID: <199904071531.LAA04453@sirocco.cc.mcgill.ca>

I also have several packages in my RW0633 in Windoze
and I would like to keep them in one place when I update the R 
system.
Brian say to modify Rprofile to
..lib.loc <- c("c:/MyR/library",.Library)
now Rprofile has a line like
.lib.loc <- unique(c(unlist(strsplit(getenv("RLIBS"),":")),.Library)
Sorry to be dense but where should I put the "C:/MyR/library" string?
inside the c("..",unlist...)
                     ^   ?
Now I have another question, I would like to implement the 
'CutCorner" mothod of random variable generation, I have the C code 
which calls a function which returns the ordinates of the 
distribution to be sampled. Since I do not want to generate normals 
or betas but distributions estimated from lowess or splines the said 
function have to be written in R. Say it is MyDist()
So I need a 'Setup" function that calls the C and set up parameters 
and passes the name of the R function to compute the distribution and 
a "Rand" function that just calls a C function that returns the 
random variate.
Now in R I put .C("Setup_system",as.double(par1),MyDist,....
How do I pass the name of the R function that evaluates the 
distribution? i.e. MyDist()
and in Setup_system.c() how do I call the R function?
S_Call("MyDist",par1,..
Thanks for any help in any or both questions.

The ":" is a mistake: it should be ";" on Windows (and is on rw0640).

I suggesting putting the line in your .Rprofile, not in Rprofile: the `.'
is crucial. That is have .Rprofile containing

.lib.loc <- c("c:/MyR/library", .Library)

Put the .Rprofile file where R will find it: it tries

HOME
R_HOME
the working directory of the shortcut launching Rgui

in turn.

An easier way if this is your personal machine is to replace the
line in etc/Rprofile by the one I have given above.

Sounds to me as if you need to use call_R and pass the function (not its
name) as an argument to .C("Setup_system", ....

Now, there are not many examples of call_R/call_S about.  Read the
appropriate section in the Blue Book rather carefully.

Subject: [R] nonparametric mixed model ?
Message-ID: <000301be811b$5071fbe0$2c4fa8c0@tring.stofanet.dk>


Dear friends. I hope you will bear over with a lengthy question. I have a problem of 76 patients on hemodialysis measured repeatedly once a month for nine months for methylmalonic acid and vitamin B12. The vitamin had been administered previously to these patients but was curtailed in the first part and then started again. There was a very clear response in that as vitamin B12 went down methylmalonic acid went up. This is as expected for people with diagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency but these patients had rather high vitamin B12 concentrations and most people wouldn't believe them to be vitamin B12 deficient. We expected the relationship between B12 and MMA to be nonlinear in that when B12 was high enough, MMA wouldn't increase. We have modeled the response in Genstat using the new REML facility and fitted a spline which shows the expected asymptote and also a 1.st order time series. In R I have fitted a Gee model of the marginals also with a first order time series and found the expected very clear negative effect of B12 on MMA. What I would like also was to fit the nonparametric mixed model in some other environment that Genstat. Perhaps the sm covariance analysis might do it but would that accomplish a mixed model ? There is for a nonspecialist perhaps the problem with all the interesting ways in R to pick up the method you really need. Some kind of index to them all or search facility would be very helpful if possible, someday.

  Not many, but one small which shows exactly this sort of things

That _is_ the example from the Blue book: you will need to read the book
(very, very carefully in my experience) to understand the incantations in
the C source.

  Konstantinos,
  there is a bug in rw0632 which, essentially, reset the console
  to 'buffered mode' every time some input was requested. In practice,
  this means that you had to re-hit Ctrl+W after any other command you 
  type (and also after other interactions, e.g., with readline()). 

  I hope to have fixed this bug (signaled some time ago on r-help
  by K. Halvorsen) in rw0633. In this release, there are also
  a 'flush.console()' function which let to update the console
  on demand. So, I will suggest to update (only reason against:
  Brian Ripley and I hope to make available a Windows binary version
  of R0.64.0 during next week; hence, you can decide to wait for it).

Hi,

I'm running 0.64 using the gnome interface on a linuxppc.

The code configures and builds without problems. In using the non gnome

the PS output in demo(graphics) is normal. In the gnome version there is
no text.
The graphics are normal.

Other than this it appears stable.

Is this a known problem?

Yes. This is why the gnome entry in NEWS is labeled EXPERIMENTAL.
What's the business with PostScript?? Normally, it's: No text on the

You might want to try:
http://www.mathsoft.co.uk/splus/download/cfortran.pdf

There is an example in there which is reasonibly clear. 


The c/fortran bit of glm code in Splus, uses some special magic stuff with
frames and memcpys.  I've got some example code of that here is that might
be a better type of solution.  Although I have try this stuff in R, and it
might not work.

As the internals of R and S are different the frame/memcpy stuff can be
guaranteed not to work. It shouldn't even compile. 

Equivalent kinds of things are possible in theory, but require an
understanding of the undocumented internals of R, and in particular the
black art of pointer protection, to stop the garbage collector tromping
all over your data. In contrast to call_S you would be working with `live'
objects on the R heap rather than fixed-address copies. There are
currently at least two attempts in progress to do this (for nlme and
survival5).

Subject: [R] KS test from ctest package
Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.19990408224903.007a4ab0@pop3.demon.co.uk>


This question is mainly aimed at Kurt Hornik as author of the ctest package,
but I'm cc'ing it to r-help as I suspect there will be other valuable
opinions out there.

I have been attempting 2 sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests using the ks.test
function from the ctest package (ctest v.0.9-15, R v.0.63.3 win32).  I am
comparing fish length-frequency distributions.  My main reference for the KS 
test at present is Sokal & Rohlf, Biometry (2nd edn), pages 440-445).

The individuals in my samples are measured to the nearest 0.5cm and so in
most samples there are several identical length values.  It appears that the
KS test statistic D is being overestimated (and the p value therefore
underestimated).
I think this is best illustrated by a trivial (but extreme) example:

	> library(ctest)
	> x <- y <- rep(1,10)
	> ks.test(x,y)

	         Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 

	data:  x and y 
	D = 1, p-value = 9.08e-005 
	alternative hypothesis: two.sided 

Obviously when two identical vectors are compared the test statistic D should
be zero and the probability that the two vectors represent the same
underlying 
distribution should be 1.

If D is calculated using the first method outlined by Sokal & Rohlf (maximum
absolute difference between relative cumulative frequencies) then D is
indeed 0.
The method used in the ctest code is presented by Sokal and Rohlf as an
alternate (NB not approximate) computation scheme and attributed to Gideon
& Mueller (1978).  The pertinent code is the line:

        z <- ifelse(order(c(x, y)) <= n.x, 1/n.x, -1/n.y).

If the two vectors in the example above had been identical, but with no
repeated values, the result of order(c(x, y)) would have been along the
lines of

 [1]  1 11  2 12  3 13  4 14  5 15  6 16  7 17  8 18  9 19 10 20

(the essential point being that items in the result come alternately
from x & y).  D is calculated as max(abs(cumsum(z))), with the result that
the minimum D for identical vectors is min(1/n.x,1/n.y).  (It therefore
appears
to me that this computational method should be considered an approximate
rather
than alternative method.)

In the case of vectors with replicated values the problem 
is worse because values from one vector are grouped in the vector returned
by order.  In the case of the example above:

> order(c(x, y))
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

I don't think this can be considered a bug, but it is certainly a problem
for the method used in computing D.  Has anyone coded alternative KS test
computation methods in R/S?  It's obviously not hard, but could be slow unless
done elegantly!

Thanks

David Middleton

If the data are discretized the KS test does not have the standard
(distribution-free) distribution. `Distribution-free' here means
independent samples from a continuous distribution. So the KS test is 
not IMHO appropriate in your problem. My view is that the function should
warn you off, and not give a p-value if it finds ties. It might be good to
construct the exact statistic, though.

Subject: [R] manova in R
Message-ID: <370E143A.2749C646@stams.strath.ac.uk>

Dear R-users,

Does anybody know if analogs of the following S-plus functions are
available (or planned to be) in R:
manova - multivariate analysis of variance
faces - Chernoff faces plot
spin -  3D visualization of data

Another thing:  are there functions for solving linear programming
problems in R or Splus?

Thank you in advance,
Sergei

Many thanks for the rapid response.  Here are the inevitable follow
up questions!

>(distribution-free) distribution. `Distribution-free' here means

>not IMHO appropriate in your problem.

I am aware that the KS test assumes samples from a continuous distribution.
Fish length obviously is a continuous variable, though it is apparent that
measuring to the nearest 0.5cm (or 1cm in some cases) does introduce a
certain discretization.  In the case I'm considering lengths to the nearest
0.5cm are the highest precision available.  I wonder, therefore, whether there
are guidelines regarding the precision required before a continuous variable
yields continuous measurements?  Possibly some criterion based on the ratio
of precision to range?  In this case the fact that there are repeated values
for the length measurements suggests there has been inherent creation of size
classes.

Sokal and Rohlf do give an approximate KS 2 sample test for large sample
sizes.  Again D is the maximum absolute difference between cumulative
relative frequencies but the difference is only calculated once per
measurement class, rather than for each individual measurement.  Their example
has sample sizes of 400-500.  Is there any published guidance for the sample
size that is considered "large enough"?

I hope that these questions are not too general for the R list - unfortunately
my access to a statistical publications is somewhat limited at present.  I do
note with satisfaction that it will be relatively easy to code the approximate
test in R.

Thanks

You can use xgobi for spin (and much more) via the interface in hte
xgobi package.

The new version of ctest tries to be more intelligent about ties.  It
gives a warning and hopefully also the right differences between the two
ecdfs.

I do a moderate amount of R development on FreeBSD 2.2.8 ...

I haven't tried the distributed 0.64, but I am grabbing a copy from CRAN
to have a look.  All I've ever had to do is install Perl 5 from the
packages collection. 

I'll get back to you ...

Yes (and not stupid, and not easy to achieve).

To do this relatively easily you need

-- rw0640 (to be released today)
-- xgobi.zip from the contrib collection for rw0640 on CRAN (since
   yesterday)
-- XGobi for Windows, from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/SWin
-- An X server: see the above for free sources.

It is possible to use rw0633, but I wouldn't suggest you try.

a completely different model.
 
Can anybody help me with this?

This is already fixed in the latest release snapshots.

Geir,

I had the same problem and got it fixed by adding an additional argument
"bwf" to the "densplot" function like this: 

"densplot" <-function (x, combine.chains = F, bwf) 
{
        x <- as.mcmc(x)
# *** Argument bwf required        do.densplot <- function(j, i) {
#     Like the next line
         do.densplot <- function(j, i, bwf) {
                #NB Using R scoping rules
                #
                if (missing(i)) 
                        y <- as.vector(x[, j, , drop = T])
                else y <- as.vector(x[, j, i, drop = T])
                y.orig <- y
# *** R complains about the next line, "illegal use of missing"
                if (missing(bwf)) {
                        N <- length(!is.na(y))
                        bw <- 1.06 * min(sd(y), IQR(y)/1.34) * 
                                N^-0.2
                }
                else {
                        bw <- bwf(y)
                        if (bw == 0) 
                                bw <- 0.1
                }
... 

There are a couple of other bugs, too.
I have notified the author/maintainer of the package and according to
him, it may be due to changes in R between 0.62 and 0.63 and he is
trying to look at the problem. 

Regards,

ST

Hello,

If I type 
               link.html.help()
a
              1:

it seems that some input is required?

Message-ID: <85256752.005B4AB2.00@notespilot.hgsi.com>

Hi,
I am having trouble making the HTML help files for the installed packages in
version 64.0
For example in 63.3 this is expected behavior:

> version
           _
platform   Windows
arch       x86
os         Win32
system     x86, Win32

minor      63.3
year       1999
month      March
day        6
language   R
> make.packages.html()
>

However, in version 64.0, I am presented with the following:


> version
           _
platform   Windows
arch       x86
os         Win32
system     x86, Win32

month      April
day        8
language   R
> link.html.help()
1.
I am not sure what I am supposed to enter at this juncture. The behavior is the
same for
make.packages.html()

Anyone know what is happening?
Partha.

Well, it does say those functions are experimental. The problem
is that system.file has changed: the second arg needs to be named,
as in system.file("TITLE", pkg = i)

Same in make.function.html, make.search.html.

  Arghh!!! And then arghh!! The new 'platform independent file 
  handling' routines have broken link.html... and friends. 
  I apologize for the inconvenience. 
  I hope to make available a solution for tomorrow (I have one
  but this time I want to test it).

       Thanks,
       That fixed the problem. I guess this will be updated in the

       Also,
       for make.function.html(), I get the error Object "fun" not

       make.search.html() works without an error.

Sooner, as Guido say he will update shortly.

Apologies for the inconvenience: I did fix and test this once, but it seems
to have dropped out of the master set.

Depends where one installed them (packages)!  If in RHOME/library, yes.
And, if earlier than 0.63.3, yes as the HTML search depends on new
features. And if under Windows, yes if you want to use off-line help.

My solution is to install in /ext/R/library, and set RLIBS to that.
Then (modulo problems with R CMD check in earlier versions) I can use
the packages from that library with lots of versions.

   I have updated rw0640b.zip in a way which, at least for me, 
   solve all these problems. For the people who has already
   dowloaded the file there is a small (1k) file (rw0640p.zip)
   which must unzipped inside 'rw0640' (just to be sure:
   it must create .../rw0640/library/base/R/Rprofile).

  Now the new files are on my ftp server 
  (ftp://ftp.stat.unipd.it/users/guido/RWin). During the night,
  they will be mirrored to Wien and, from there, to the other
  CRAM mirrors.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990414061041.1583B-100000@cbe207.gcal.ac.uk>

I would like to have a function that inputs a file name, then reads that
data file and does various stuff to it.
Something like:

doit<-function(filename)        
{
x<-scan("~/rstuff/data/"filename)
#for example, if filename is a0.dat, it will scan("~/rstuff/data/a0.dat")  
...
}

Can someone please tell me how to do this?

Thanks for any help!

this Unix/Linux only? (I'm presuming it's some kind of function

       One (unrelated) question:Is there an R wishlist floating around

Yes sorry this is not documented.  It definitely works under Unix.
Usage is

	R CMD check [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n

where `pkg_i' is the file path to the sources of the ith package for
checking.  Currently, only the examples are checked for completion of
execution, more will be added in the future.

Yes, at present. What it does is to run all the examples on the help
pages of a package, which may be useful if there are any!  It needs the
package source as well (although in principle it need not).

I am working on a Windows equivalent.

Thank you very much Guido and Brian!

On my machine (with MikTeX installed), I use as helpPRINT.bat (building on
the proposed example):

@echo off
pdflatex \nonstopmode\input{%1}
start %1.pdf
rm %1.tex %1.aux %1.log
exit

to get help pages in Acrobat Reader and it works fine, but only after I put
the Rd.sty latex package (from CRAN) in the rw0640\bin directory and, in
the same directory, a Rhelp.cfg file with the command \usepackage{Rd}.

Is this the right thing to do?

Subject: [R] No LOGLM coefficients 
Message-ID: <3714E9BC.5555486F@gironet.nl>

Dear R-helpers,

Im trying to fit a Log-linear model on a dataset with bird counts from
60 sites over 14 years for 12 months each (factors for the models). One
of the aims is to predict the missing values in this dataset with model
predictions.
Ive first tried to work with GLM's, that worked fine except for models
with one or more interaction-terms. The GLMs run, run .. for hours. So I
switched to using LOGLM (MASS-library), and that worked swift. The
deviances were the same so that worked well. The only problem is that my
data contains both zero's (rarely) and  quite a lot of NA's. LOGLM
doesn't report the params in these cases (the help file reports this)
but I still want to use them for predicting my missing values.

Does anybody have a suggestion to by-pass this problem ?

Cor

It should include Rd.sty automatically. The problem is that the file

RHOME/doc/manual/Rd.sty

is missing from the binary distribution. If you put it there this should 
work without any files in the bin directory.

Apologies: of course I have never checked the final distribution, and this
works on a source build.  I wondered if anyone would ever use this,
so am actually pleased to find a bug report!

BTW, using PDF format for help files is one of the ideas under debate.
Another is to provide Windows-style help files.

What you want is the fitted values, not the coefficients, I think. You can
get those, I believe, from loglm/loglin.  If not, you know who to bug: the
author of loglm is WNV, although I made it work under R.

Gee, thanks a bunch Brian.  I was looking for something to do...

loglm (note: all lower case, even on that other OS) fits
log-linear models by iterative proportional scaling (IPS).  It
will give correct deviances and fitted values for all present
observations.  Structural zeros can be distingished from observed
zeros, too.  It will not automatically give fitted values for
missing observations, though, since the iterative scaling
algorithm provides no simple way to do this.  This is why no
predict.loglm function is provided, but one would not be all that
difficult to construct, in fact.  The idea is as follows:

Take the fitted values you have.  These have the the correct
multiplicative structure, so their logarithms have an exact (up
to iteration and round-off error) additive structure.  Fit the
corresponding ordinary unweighted linear model to these logged
values and the parameter estimates are the parameters you need to
predict the missing (or new) data.  Predict accordingly.  Bingo.

Well, nearly bingo.  What is lacking is any easy way to find
standard errors for such parameter estimates and hence for the
predicted values.  All the bits are there, but digging them out
is a bit of a chore, possibly as work-intensive as the very glm
procedure that loglm was intended to sidestep.

In summary, if all you want are predicted values, in principle
this is not too hard, but if you are a true statistician you
would never be happy with parameter estimates that do not have
at least some vague hint of error estimates attached.  That's why
I didn't bother writing it myself in the first place...

Added little note: Fitting the linear model looks as if you
would need to construct the same model matrix as the glm fitting
procedure would need, and if this were a large problem, as IPS
problems often are, it might pose a memory difficulty.  However
if you are really on the ball you could overcome this one by
using iterative *additive* scaling, aka Stephens' algorithm.  It
would be handy to have an IAS function in S+/R to handle large
linear models.  Does anyone have a spare long weekend coming up?
You could also accumulate the parameter estimates as the IPS
procedure progresses, but this would involve hacking into the C
routine and on S+ that is (I think) not part of the open code.

(There may be a note to JCGS here if anyone has the time and grit
to poke around.  It would make a good little Honours project.)

Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.3.96.990414230103.5882A-100000@ln.nimh.nih.gov>

Hi, all.

I'm trying to use some linear regression models in which both the
dependent and independent variables are measured with some error.  To
make things worse, while the errors in the dependent variable are uniform,
the errors in the independent (or explanatory, or "x") variables can be
heteroskedastic.  I've been looking at the book _Measurement Error Models_
by Fuller (1987).  I'm wondering whether anybody knows any other
references on the subject, and whether anyone has written S or R code that
handles these kinds of problems.  (As far as I can tell, the usual lm and
glm functions don't; if I'm wrong, that's great.)

Thanks for any pointers.

Well, there are of lots of other references, even one by me, but that is
the main book. If lm and glm did this they would be wrong: it is a
different statistical model. There are several Fortran solutions on statlib
in multi/leiv?

1.      Programs for best line fitting with errors in both coordinates.

2.      D. York, "Least squares fitting of a straight line", Canadian 
                 Journal of Physics, 44, 1079-1086, 1986.
        G. Fasano and R. Vio, "Fitting straight lines with errors on both
                 coordinates", Newsletter of Working Group for Modern 
                 Astronomical Methodology, No. 7, 2-7, Sept. 1988.
        B.D. Ripley and M. Thompson, "Regression techniques for the 
                 detection of analytical bias", Analyst, 112, 377-383,
                 1987.

and I have seen an S interface somewhere (multiv?). Today, I would take the
algorithm in the last of those papers and re-write it in S in a few
minutes. A project that has, several times, nearly made the MASS library
and one I set as a exercise in my linear models course.

Thanks to ShumTim for comments on the problems regarding CODA. 
As noted, the "missing" problem is not the only one in CODA, and
correcting this
only made CODA to crash at another place. It therefore seems best to
wait for
an updated version of CODA

This really has nothing to do with R (I don't think, anyway -- could it be done
with lme?), but we do this kind of thing all the time using the HLM program
(Bryk, Raudenbush and Congden). At level 1, the outcome is the measure divided
by the standard error, and a series of dummies, one for each type of measure,
divided by the standard error. The level 1 variance is fixed at 1.0. These
1/s.e.,  come down to level 2, where they can be considered ``true score''
estimates of the measures, as outcomes, or as predictors, if you use  the
latent variable regression capability of HLM. I believe this capability is in
the latest version of the HLM program (maybe not -- we use a pre-release
version here), and the procedure should be detailed in the 2nd edition of Bryk
and Raudenbush, _Hierarchical Linear Models_, to be published (by Sage again?)
this summer or fall.

For me, it's a cool feature: I use the standard help file when I know what
I want to do, but I don't remember that !?$* option I need.

But, to learn the details of a new (for me)  command I prefer the visually
pleasant and  typographically elegant (yes, I print sometimes...) pdf files
produced by pdflatex with this new feature (and so I can appreciate the
hard work of the R team in the developpement of the R help file format...)

Please be patient: rw0640 was only released very late on Monday, and
this is not my primary occupation!  In some cases you _need_ the
versions of pre-built packages for rw0640:  there is no version of sm
for rw0640 there, yet. I have one working, but not yet fully tested. (I
put one up briefly but removed it pending testing on the release
version of r0640.)  If you are in hurry, you need to build from source.

Please remember that 0.64.0 is quite a large architectural change
and as the contrib area README says:

`Very little testing has been done: please report problems but do not
expect quick repairs.'

And `report problems' means to me, not to R-help nor R-bugs!  One problem
for me is that many package authors do not provide any working examples
for even minimal testing to be done.

Oops. You put your packages in a library, I believe.

Downloaded the sources and built them yourself, I assume. (If not,
why not?)

The pre-built 0.4 versions on CRAN today both work for me.  Which
versions, which precise file dates, on which OS?  Because of problems
with missing files and with corrupt help files in the Lindsey 0.4 set I
have put up several successive versions.  I will re-build
tonight on a Win 95 machine and you can see if this resolves the
problem: if not, you should build them yourself.

As I said, you _need_ the 0.64.0 version that I have not yet put
up, and if you had compiled from source you would not have this problem.

If you want to send a bug report to me, I need very much more information:
the contents of the bug.report() form would be helpful.

Does R have something similar?

Well, shooting from the hip ... Something like the following ought to do
the trick.
 
"stamp" <-
function (string = date(), print = TRUE, plot = TRUE) 
{
    if (print) 
        cat(string)
    if (plot && .Device != "null device") {
        mar <- par("mar")[[1]]
        usr <- par("usr")
        plt <- par("plt")
        at <- usr[2] + (usr[2] - usr[1]) * (1 - plt[2]) / (plt[2] - plt[1])
        mtext(string, side = 1, adj = 1, line = mar - 1, at = at)
    }
}

It doesn't place the label in the plot identically, but this is the
spirit of the function.

[ This has also revealed a bug in the "date" function.  It leaves a
newline appended to the date string. ]

It is not a question of limits under Windows 98, It is a question of limits
under R.  Which version is this?  (You should be using 30M not 30
in a current version.)

The nsize limit is currently 20,000,000 in both Unix and gnuwin32 versions,
but you can increase it by re-compiling. You are trying to create a 488Mb
matrix (if real) and I would have thought heap space not cons cells was
your problem. That has a limit of 2048M.

If I try

 matrix(0, 8000, 8000) -> jj

I get

Error: heap memory (30720 Kb) exhausted [needed 500000 Kb more]
       See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.

Subject: [R] nested unbalanced ANOVA
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990416152511.697B-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>


Dear all,

is there a standard way to calculate a nested, unbalanced ANOVA with R?
I am glad for pointers, tips, ideas.

The problem that I am trying to evaluate is a comparison of (average) 
group sizes. The explanatory variables that I would like to include are
species which are nested within families and (partly) crossed with region,
i.e. some species occurr in several regions while others do not. For some
species I have several estimates of average group size in a given region
and, of course, not all families have the same number of species but each 
species only occurrs in one family.

I actually went back to Splus (5.0 R2 for Sun SPARC) because Splus has the
nested %in%, rsp. / which can be included in a formula, but the two models

res <- aov (gs ~ fam/spe + reg)
res <- aov (gs ~ fam + reg + spe)

calculate exactly the same ANOVA table. Am I completely wrong or they?

Is it ok instead, if I calculate aov (fam + spe + reg) but test the family
in that I divid its mean square by the mean square of species to get an
F-value or is this too crude? 

Thanks for your help. Regards, Lorenz

MDI seems much better (at least if we are to sell this to people who

Yes.  Some people don't know what zip files are, and I have had
to take time introducing zip files first.   But then again, if the

copies of R for free to researchers.

Many people I have introduced R to here in the Philippines have
been very, very impressed w/ what R can do.  But they find it very
hard to do the programming (and memorizing the syntax).
Many are just beginning at learning programming here (even
within the world of statistical practictioners).   We would very
much appreciate having a menu driven option similar for instance
to what I have seen in CODA.  Even just a crude kind of library
maybe.  Actually, some of us at the govt agency I work for --
the Statistical Research and Training Center -- are contemplating
the viability of working on developing a library w/c provides
menus at least for the benefit of those who are not very
computer literate and who may just want to enter data and
get some simple statistical analysis.

Thank you for all the valuable feedback so far. I will try to produce a
summary of views and suggestions early next week, so there is plenty of
time for more views.

There is a clear polarization between those who like Windows, and those who
use it under duress!  Fine: there does not need to be just one version.

Apologies in advance from an R newbie if this is a dumb question. Is it
possible to produce choropleth maps in R? I gather from some nice research
papers on the AT&T (sorry, Lucent) S web site that in S (and S Plus) there
is a map() function which uses arrays of polylines and regions to draw map
borders and then fill them with patterns or shades according to some scalar
quantity. We currently produce such maps (of disease rates) using PROC GMAP
in SAS/GRAPH which also uses the same sort of polyline format for definition
of the areas. The problem in SAS is that although the colours and sharding
can be precisely controlled, the means of allocating those colours to
regions on the map or ranges in the data stinks.

If the map() function hasn't been implemented in R, are there any plans?

I must say that we have been mightily impressed by the scope and stability
of R. We are using it under Win NT at present but we are about to set it up
on a Linux box. I am very much hoping that we can spend this year's
discretionary budget on a nice new and fast Linux box (stuffed with RAM) for
running R rather than spending the same amount on two S Plus licenses for
Windows (which are not exactly cheap since we are a government department,
although since we started paying for SAS each year nothing shocks us any
more...).

I am most of the way through porting the Becker/Wilks code to R and I will
be finishing this some time in the next few months.  Fritz Leisch has also
expressed an interest and I passed what I had along to him. The remaining
problems to solve are:

  1. Thinning the polygons which make up the map (so they will print in
      postscript).

  2. Assembling a reasonable collection of map projections.

There is nothing difficult in this, its just a matter of finding a few
days to do the job.

In addition I'm looking at putting a better set of maps together (I'm
expecting the US National Imagery and Mapping Agency 4 CD set to show up
on my doorstep at any minute).

If you have Java expertise available, you might also want to have a look
at Openmap from BBN <http://openmap.bbn.com>.  It looks like a pretty good
framework for doing high-quality mapping work. Now if we just had that
R/Java link which John Chambers and Duncan Temple Lang are working on ...

I know the feeling, though we fare a little better because we are
educational.  My department is however looking into getting SAS Data
Enterprise Miner -- which should effectively absorb any amount of budget
excess we might have.

Fantastic! I would be happy to assist with the preparation of map data,
especially for NZ, Australia, Sth Pacific and SE Asia.

Does anyone know what algorithm R uses in glm, family=binomial (i.e. a

I assume that it's in the source somewhere, but I wasn't able to find
it.  I'd like to know
what file it's in (in a unix distribution of R).

Thanks for your help.

src/library/base/R/glm.R, or just list the glm and glm.fit functions.
The `meat' is in glm.fit.

R uses the `standard' Nelder-Wedderburn IWLS algorithm for this problem.
That is explained in a number of places.  One Bill Venables and I
particularly like is

Firth, D. (1991) Generalized linear models. Chapter 3 of Hinkley, D. V.,
Reid, N. and Snell, E. J. eds (1991) Statistical Theory and Modelling. In
Honour of Sir David Cox, FRS. London: Chapman & Hall.

Perhaps the most elementary exposition is in

A. J. Dobson (1990) "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models"
Chapham & Hall.

which was previously

A. J. Dobson (1983) "An Introduction to Statistical Modelling".
  
It is a useful exercise (one I set our graduate students) to write out the
details in the logistic regression case, where some terms cancel.

You didn't say what distribution/platform you are using.  If you
are using Red Hat Linux/Intel or Red Hat Linux/Sparc or Linuxppc
then it is my problem. 

These files are generated by the post-install script. You should
see something like this when you install:

[root at hobbes i386]# rpm -Uvh R-base-0.64.0-1.i386.rpm
R-base                      ##################################################
updating LibIndex for library  /usr/lib/R/library ...
updating HTML index ...

If the script did not execute for any reason then I would like to
know why. Let me know what the error message was.  Also, you should
check that you are using a fairly up-to-date version of rpm. I am
using version 2.5.2.

The rpms for the contrib packages will be updated when I get a spare
moment (which may not be soon).

I am using windows NT 4.0 R0640, and click on the Rterm

I was wondering if it is my typing, but the same typing

It is your typing beating the command-line preprocessing: Rgui 
runs differently.  I had noticed this, but Rterm is really designed to
be used in BATCH mode.

This can probably be improved, but is a long way down the list....

Subject: [R] A couple problems installing 0.64 (under linux, redhat 5.2)
Message-ID: <371B83B7.338DE63D@enteract.com>

I'm encountering a couple problems configuring and making R 0.64 under
linux, redhat 5.2
These problems didn't occur when I build 0.63.2

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

(1) configure generates the warning:

"configure: warning: Cannot determine how to create shared libraries.
    Please set CPICFLAGS, FPICFLAGS and SHLIBLDFLAGS in `config.site'."

I'm not sure what's needed here.  The only flag I use to create shared
libs is '-shared',
but adding that to config.site not make the warning go away.

(2) Apparently there are some X headers that make is not finding.  Make
generates the
(terminal) error:

" ...
gcc -O3  -I../include -I../../src/include -ansi -c dataentry.c
In file included from dataentry.c:24:
dataentry.h:22: X11/X.h: No such file or directory
dataentry.h:23: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory
dataentry.h:24: X11/Xutil.h: No such file or directory
dataentry.h:25: X11/keysym.h: No such file or directory
dataentry.h:26: X11/cursorfont.h: No such file or directory"

Any idea where these headers are on a redhat system? I can't seem to
find them
in any of the usual places.

Thanks,

Both of these are the same path problem.  You need /usr/X11R6/bin in the
path for configure to find xmkmf, and you need /usr/X11R6/include for the
include files. Configure found

X_CFLAGS =  -I/usr/X11R6/include
X_LIBS =  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11
X_PRE_LIBS =  -lSM -lICE

for me once I had /usr/X11R6/bin in the path. I build on Linux remotely,
and have to ensure that the X bits are in my path (when they would
be automatically if I used the console, if that was not a terminal
in a locked room in another building, ....

I am doing a lot of graphs for a thesis at the minute, many of which need

It's a bug (apparently of the same flavor as using eval(x) to force
lazy evaluation - which works only if x is not an expression):

> title(xlab=expression(alpha*"-1-m")) # OK
> args<-list(xlab=expression(alpha*"-1-m"))
> do.call("title",args)
Error: Object "alpha" not found

Thanks for pointing it out. For a workaround, try plotting the boxplot
without the xlab, then add the xlab using title() directly.

Subject: [R] varcomp?
Message-ID: <199904210809.KAA08000@pandora3.localnet>

Hello R experts,

I haven't found anything like the S function 'varcomp' as described in
W.N. Venables & B.D. Ripley's 'Modern Applied Statistics ...' for R;
does something comparable exist for R, or is planned for future
releases? 

More generally, are there libraries with post-anova test procedures,
like Student-Newman-Keuls? Or do those of you who frequently use anova
for testing experimental results the necessary tests "by hand"? I
would be interested in information about such packages, as well as
about literature recommendations if you think I should learn more
about anova and R before asking silly questions in this noble list ;-)

And I beg your pardon if I simply overlooked something on CRAN ...

Many thanks,
Ulf

Subject: [R] trivial axis question?
Message-ID: <371DBE6C.324C71EC@epfl.ch>

Hi,

probably there's some parameter I don't know how to set.
Using R 0.64 on a Sun sparc, I use the following command

axis(1, at=xspos(times), labels=result, cex.axis=0.7)
where result is sth. like  c("May", "Jun" ,"Jul" ,"Aug", "Sep", ...)
Now it plots it fine.. but when two xspos are too (?) close together
the label gets dropped. That's probably a feature to save
the user from overwriting two entries. E.g. I have an x-axs May Jul Aug
(ommitting the Jun entry).
Can I manually force R -- to write all xais entries -- independent
of overlap, etc. -- or is there a vlaue where I can set the threshold
I can set to tell R when to write and when not to write?
Thanks for your time,

        Armin

Dear R users,

How do you set the color of the border in barplots?
On my screen
barplot(tN, col='gray', border='yellow')
looks like grey bars -- with black borders (not yellow).

Trying it with a postscript device gives the same result.

I'm new to R. I became interested in it because my friends at the Swarm

to work as a front end for HDF5 datasets.

>From looking at the RPMS for R, I got the idea they were compiled
without support for HDF5. Correct?

If you are interested in the HDF5 data format and R, on my page I have
RPMS for HDF5 and R-with-hdf5 support compiled in.  If they don't work
for you, I'd appreciate knowing.  These are compiled for Redhat 5.2.

The directory is:

A rather imprecise question!  aov with Error() terms may well do what
you want, as might the lme package.

Dear R experts,

R (0.63) does not seem to write me any text in a PS file.
Trying

x11()
plot(12)
text(5,5, "Hello World")

works fine.

Now I would like to have the same as a PS file.
postscript("foobar.ps")
plot(12)
text(5,5,"Hello World")
dev.off()

Gives me a PS file with the plot -- but without the
"Hello World".

Why? I'm completely clueless.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.9904211808430.4595-100000@tortoise.bio.indiana.edu>


R-helpers,

When I source("tmp.r") a file from within R, the code executes without
error. When I launch with 'R --no-save --no-restore < tmp.r', the code
sometimes appears to cause some type of buffer overflow and nothing gets
executed.

tmp.r contains:
myData<-c(1,0, ... long vector of numbers) followed by a new
line character and then some code to operate on myData.

It appears that when the vector is long, say 121 x 17 digits numbers, the
new line character is not recognized, because R prints a newline, but puts
the '+' continuation symbol on the next line, and does so for each
subsequent line, as follows ...

... 0.673485477583901, 0.492934866805126, 0.67+ 97955088067,
0.359755098747052, 0.734365384276714, 0.776102576892879, 1)
+ Dmatrix <- matrix (mydata, byrow=TRUE, nrow=11, ncol=11 )
+ result<-eigen(Dmatrix)
+ varEig<-var(result$values)
+ cat (c('variance of the eigenvalues:', varEig), fill=TRUE)
 
When the list is shorter, I don't get this problem.

Anyone have any ideas as to what is going on?  The reason I am doing this
is to call R from a PERL program.  

Thanks, Alex

Sorry -- that does indeed work (I'm getting tired),
if you put text(1,5) - you see it,
but I do have several problems generating PS files.

For what I do, I can't use the axis function - so I use
the text command to put the text under the x-axis.
i.e. x11(); plot(12); text(1,6, "test");

This works - fine in x11() mode -- but running
the same in postscript("foobar") mode - fails --
It simply doesn't get printed.

Playing with mtext instead of text -- I noted
that mtext appears in the PS file.
With mtext I can't set the y coordinate (right?),
so I change the margin par(mar=c(0.4, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1)) and
and the mtext with side=1 is close enough to the
x-axis to display the text under the ticks for
the x-axis. Doing the same in PS mode - I
do not seem to succeed to change the par(mar-c(..))
I get no error message, but looking at the output
nothing has changed, i.e. the "default margin size"
seems not to be changeable for the PS device?

Thak you very much for any help
    Armin, trying to make PS files.

Version? OS?  On my R-0.64.0 on Solaris I can do this with 1000 17-digit
numbers, so I think there is particular problem with your setup.

The NL is only used to break up input: this is saying that what it has seen
so far is syntactically incomplete.  Is this a standard Unix text file (if
you are on Unix)?

The obvious fix is to put the data in a separate file and use scan(),
which will be more efficient (as the input does not need to go through the
parser and you do not need to create R's dump format).

Subject: [R] Re: trivial axis question?
Message-ID: <371F1889.A0C18B37@ozemail.com.au>

Armin,

Here is the bare-bones routine for doing staggered labels.

staxlab <- function (xticlabels, ypos)
{
    if (!missing(xticlabels)) {
        if (missing(ypos)) {
            yrange <- par("usr")[3:4]
            ypos <- c(yrange[1] - (yrange[2] - yrange[1])/22,
                yrange[1] - (yrange[2] - yrange[1])/12)
        }
        axis(1, 1:length(xticlabels), rep("", length(xticlabels)))
        text(1:length(xticlabels), ypos, xticlabels)
    }
    else cat("Usage: staxlab(xticlabels [,ypos])\n")
}

Try this  for a basic test:

> plot(1:10,xaxt="n")
> staxlab(rep("Testing123",10))

The default 'ypos' will usually squeeze the staggered labels in, but you
may wish to pass specific values for 'ypos' and perhaps even adjust the
X-axis label by increasing the space
at the bottom of the plot;

>par(mar=c(6,4,4,2))    or (7,4,4,2)...

not letting 'plot' print an X-axis label;

>plot(...,xlab="",...)

printing an X-axis label below where it would normally be;

>text(5,-1.5,"Index")

and finally spreading out the tick labels;

> staxlab(rep("Testing123",10),c(0,-0.5))


Looking at your other questions, I suspect that part of your problem may
be your system.  I can't reproduce the errors on either of my Linux
systems, both running R v0.63.2.  I think I recall someone having
problems with the Postscript output on the Windows version of R 0.63.
Note that I've tested 'staxlab' on both of my systems as well.

Jim

I am using R-0.63.3 on linux-x86.

It is a standard text file.  If it were syntactially incomplete, sourcing
it from the R prompt would fail, but it doesn't.

What I have ended up doing is calling R from PERL or the command line
with the following:

echo "source ('tmp0.r')" | R --no-save --no-restore

This works.  

I am still not clear on why the command-line redirection did not work
(R --no-save --no-restore < tmp.r).  Is there a difference between how
R handles input received from a unix pipe versus from redirection?

No. But there are substantial differences between how it handles
source() vs. how it deals with redirected input. Try deciphering the
source function and you'll see. 

As to your original problem: From 0.63.3 to 0.64.0

BUG FIXES

    o   strsplit(), scan() and friends use a much larger char buffer
         (still fixed size; this will change again)

and 0.64.1 (out in a fortnight or so) will have


    o   load / save / data allow unlimited string sizes.

    o   strsplit() allows unlimited string size.

We here at HGSI have a consultant doing some statistical work for us.
HGSI bought and installed SAS, but our consultant insists that R and
Rweb is a better solution. I do not know either package so I do not
know, hence we are ditching SAS for R and Rweb. Any comments on this
are welcom.

Now for the real problem. Rweb is very expensive (time wise). The 
number of prereqs is way more than I thought when I agreed to this
project. The compiling tree looks like this

Interesting...

Not knowing what your applications are like, it's a bit difficult to
comment on, though.

Shouldn't be a big problem on Solaris.

The line for compiling dataentry.c is

        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(X_CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $<

and you don't seem to be picking up the  $(X_CFLAGS). These come from
the Makeconf file created by configure. Did you by any chance forget
to remove config.cache before running configure?

[for a pure Rweb application, you probably wouldn't need X at all, but
the --without-x switch doesn't actually work, I suspect]

ooops, he is not a consultant, he is a full time employee. it also seems
that we are not ditching sas. instead he will be using R in certain places
where sas would take too long.

well, there is also an oracle database on the machine and i also don't
exactly know what the DBA does. i just try to keep the machine up and
running as much as possible and tuned fast as possible.

removing the config.cache was the fix. i felt a little stupid so i
greped and finally reread the faq/readme/install and found nothing
on removing config.cache. must be some general knowledge thing about
config scripts that i did not know about.


thanks for all the help, now onto Rweb

That is not what I asked!

But the version read from the file is syntactically incomplete.... This
implies that something is going wrong in the read.

Not on my system, and as it does work for me on Solaris, the problem seems
to be specific to something in your version.

You're not the first one to get bitten by that. I suppose we really
should zap the old cache at the beginning of the configure script,
even though it's rather convenient for those of us who recompile on a
near-daily basis to have configure run through a bit faster.

Subject: [R] Summary: Future directions for R on Windows
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.9904222155260.24465-100000@auk.stats>

On Thursday 15 March I wrote:

We have had 25 replies, and congratulations to all but one person for
following the instructions on where to send them. They were very
constructive and raised a lot of points not taken up here but which we
will discuss amongst ourselves and R-core.

Here is a summary of opinion, and our current views.


   o   Use a standard MDI interface like MS Office's, say. Would you 
       prefer an MDI interface to the current one, and if so is the
       `standard' `look and feel' important?

RESPONSES:
  Pretty evenly divided between `be as standard as possible' and
  `happy to be different'.  For those who didn't know, MDI is
  `multiple document interface' and means lots of sub-windows in one
  large frame.	

PROPOSALS:
  Guido has been busy, and a MDI version is running as a
  prototype. The next rwxxxx will allow the current (SDI) or MDI
  styles via a configuration file / command-line flag.  We are looking
  at building a different front-end with the `standard' look, as an
  alternative.


   o   Replace the help system by standard Windows help files. Would
       you like this instead of text help, html help or both?

RESPONSES:
  Some of you want this, some of you hate it. Someone who hates them
  wants a help file system that allows full text searches, apparently
  unaware that Windows help files are the one choice that does allow them.

PROPOSALS:
  The hooks are now in, and I will work slowly on Rd -> hlp
  conversion scripts. Then those who want it can use it.


   o   rw0640 implements offline printing via latex.  Do you anticipate
       using this?  (It needs lots of extra files.)  Would printing from
       a Windows help file be an adequate replacement?

RESPONSES:
  A few people use it / or will use it. One thinks people who use
  Windows do not use LaTeX, but two high-quality freeware projects
  (fptex, MiKTeX) show otherwise. Some of you would prefer PS or PDF.

PROPOSALS:
  Keep distributing the latex files.  The future of help formats for R
  as a whole is under discussion.


   o   Build an R dll that can be linked into other applications to drive
       effectively an R command-line by passing input strings. Possibly
       versions without and without on-screen graphics.

RESPONSES:
  Those who saw a use were very enthusiastic.
       

   o   Implement inter-process communications, either
   
       -  Windows-style (DDE and ActiveX automation) or
       -  CORBA-style  (real standards)
       
       This might allow R to be called from a spreadsheet or Visual Basic 
       front-end, for example.

RESPONSES:
  Those who saw a use were very enthusiastic, and a few wanted CORBA,
  but most want to be able to communicate with the likes of Excel.

PROPOSALS:
  This is linked to the previous point and to the overall design of R.
  We will investigate what might be possible, but do not expect
  progress real soon.


   o   Would you prefer an installer as well as / instead of the 
       current set of smallish zip files?

RESPONSES:
  Many people said they don't want one but knew people who would like
  one.  Many people don't trust them! Many people want < 1 floppy chunks.

PROPOSALS:
  To build an installer like that used by GSView, that unpacks the zip
  files for you to a place you choose and allows you to select the
  parts you want. I think this might be helpful for installing
  packages too.  The pieces will remain in the 1Mb region.

   o   How important is it that R can be built from source with free
       tools?  (We are not contemplating requiring any new tools to
       install packages, but a Windows-standard interface probably 
       requires a commercial compiler with MFC.)

RESPONSES:
  Not much interest in building R from source from the respondents but
  some strong views from within R-core.  A few people said they
  thought this should be possible but would not actually do it.

PROPOSALS:
  We will experiment.  There are some concerns that the port should
  not depend on one or two people, but I feel requiring a serious
  developer of R itself to buy a particular compiler is not really an
  issue. (I have done this many times for other systems.  My time is
  much more expensive than compilers.)


  We would also welcome other suggestions.  Some of this appears easy,
  some rather hard, so there are no guarantees that anything will be done.

RESPONSES:
  There were lots of points. The most common requests were for

  o  Some sort of programmable menu system to add commands to menus.

  o  A spreadsheet-like data editor in R.

  o  Customizable graphics (I take this to mean editing graphics after
     they are drawn).

  o  Connections to external databases, ability to read/write Excel and
     dBase files, ....  (To some extent having ActiveX would avoid any
     need for this.)

  o  Ability to use VC++ to compile for R. [This one is already there:
     see the V&R2 `R Complements' for a worked example, and I have
     added that info to readme.packages.]

  o  Some of you want more optimized code. This might be possible via
     compiler options although we think the compiler we use is quite
     good and our version compares well with the Linux version on the
     same hardware. There are performance tuning issues for R, but not
     just this version and not yet.

and lots of not-specific-to-Windows things like gam(), flexible memory
management, three-dimensional and Trellis-like graphics.  Perhaps
unsuprisingly the first four points are common in other Windows
statistical systems, including the `R-like' one.


Some of those things are hard for us to see how to do, and we are not
enamoured of low-level Windows programming. We would appreciate help
on

  -- Examples of database connections / spreadsheet imports from open
     source packages we could use for inspiration, and any examples of
     open source/other code that already does that.

  -- Windows programming. Someone who is quite familiar with Windows
     programming could do many of these things rather quickly without
     knowing anything about R internals.


As before, private comments only please, and remember that you will only
get what the volunteers (guido + I + ...) want to work on.

Hehe. You've been doing too little Perl hacking, Brian! When a Perl
hacker says that he has 121 17 digit numbers followed by a NL, he
means that he has *one* input line which is over 2k long...

I can reproduce the behaviour with an old pre-0.63.3, the new versions
have improved:

> x<-c(0.2540311, -0.6709876, -0.3677535, 0.5153803, 0.08444575, -0.6793758..
...-1.476418, -0.5809392, 0.48Error: syntax error
Execution halted

Well, kind of improved...

I'm not sure this is very easy to fix. R_ReadConsole deals in 1024
byte buffers in several places. The workaround should be obvious,
though.

Gulp.  No I really mean GULP!

Without additional info it is hard to comment.  What is your
application?

Try leaving out the specification of where the X libraries are.
Autoconf is pretty good at figuring things like this out.

Most people I know are using X11R6 now, but I think that openwindows is
current enough for it to do the job.

The path to the X11 include files is not being set.  Try letting the
configure script discover the location of them.  If that fails, do the
configure and then try setting the correct lines in Makeconf.

My lines on Solaris look like

X_CFLAGS =  -I/usr/local/X11R6/include
X_LIBS =  -L/usr/local/X11R6/lib -R/usr/local/X11R6/lib -lX11
X_PRE_LIBS =  -lSM -lICE                                     
X_EXTRA_LIBS = -lsocket  -lnsl                               

which suggests that something like

X_CFLAGS =  -I/usr/openwin/include
X_LIBS =  -L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11
X_PRE_LIBS =                                 
X_EXTRA_LIBS = -lsocket  -lnsl                               

may work under openwindows.

Let us know what happens.  As a last resort we can get you binaries.

To, the contrary, I have been doing far too much recently, as you will see
when Rd2hlp gets released. To the point that I would never do that, and
precisely my point about the file: there had to be something unusual about
it.

Subject: [R] basic question about lm summaries
Message-ID: <371FDB52.22666F49@csi.com>

I'm very new to R and I'm having trouble doing something that should be
very simple (so I'm probably missing something quite obvious).  When I
run
> lm(data$CRIME~data$INCOME+data$HOUSING)
I get the correct coefficients.  However, when I try to get anything
else out of this I get a message about a missing argument, e.g.:
> summary.lm(lm.d1<-lm(data$CRIME~data$INCOME+data$HOUSING))
Error: Argument "n" is missing, with no default
None of the documentation mentions this argument "n", though I notice
that there is a variable "n" in the function definition.  My apologies
if this seems like too basic a question but any assistance is greatly
appreciated.
Regards,
Andy Bernat
P.S. I'm using the rw0640 binaries for windows 95.

You need to find out where that error message is coming from, by 
traceback(). The documentation for the function giving the error
probably mentions n.

I won't try to solve the problem (you need to send us an example to
reproduce), but I will try to help make using R easier.

-- use  lm(CRIME ~ INCOME + HOUSING, data=data). That is easier to read
   (it would be even easier without the capitals) and ensures that the
   variables are searched for in `data', which I hope is a data frame (but
   lists work too, I believe).

-- Don't ever call methods unless you mean to do something very unusual. Do
   summary(lm(CRIME ~ INCOME + HOUSING, data=data))

-- Unless you really need them, avoid assignments as arguments. They are
   hard to read and easy to miss when skimming code. In other words, use

   lm.d1 <- lm(data$CRIME~data$INCOME+data$HOUSING)
   summary(lm.d1)

-- Try the opposite convention, d1.lm. Names with a system name . something 
   are normally either methods or helper functions.  And surely it is the
   data that is important here, not lm.

-- Avoid names like `data'.  One guess as to the root of your problem is
   that another object named `data' (other than the one you meant) is 
   being found. Now, some analysis suggests that is unlikely, but if the 
   data frame had been called `UScrime' I would have had no analysis to do.

These header files are part of the XFree86-devel package. On my system (RedHat
intel 5.2) they are in /usr/X11R6/include/X11/. Anyway, why are you rebuilding
the packages? Why not just install the binary rpms?

Carl,

Your compiling tree looks like it is from an older version of Rweb.
I'm not sure the most recent version of Rweb is an improvement as far
as the requirements for supporting software go, but I tried.
The most recent version of Rweb is available at:

ftp://ftp.math.montana.edu/pub/umsfjban/RwebCurrentRelease.tar.gz

and it includes a configure and install script that will eliminate all
of your installation problems (and if you believe that ...)

Anyway, the current software requirements for Rweb are:

	R
	Perl (preferably 5.004 or higher)
	   Perl module CGI.pm (included in Perl 5.004 or higher)
	   Perl module Simple.pm (part of the LWP module which is part
           of the libwww module)
	Four functions from the NetPNM library
	   pstopnm, ppmtogif, pnmcrop, and pnmflip
	Ghostscript (required by the pstopnm function)

The pstoimg function from Latex2html is no longer needed so this may 
solve the problem you were having with the installation of Rweb.

Subject: [R] pictex
Message-ID: <3723228A.9CD8EF59@inreach.com>

Hi, I am very new to R and trying to bring my plot of residuals to my
LaTex document, and seems as I need some help.

I first tried the example from the help file, e.g.

pictex(file="model1.tex", width=5, height=4)
plot(1:11,(-5:5)^2, type='b', main="Simple Example Plot")
dev.off()

this worked fine in LaTex when I did :

\centerline{\input{Rplots.tex}}

However, with my residuals plot, which looks like :

pictex(file="model1.tex")
plot(fitted(model1),resid(model1),xlab="Fitted values",
ylab="Residuals", main="Residuals vs Fitted")

I can see OK the generated plot  in my Xwindow, but LaTex complains that
requires more memory. I am not a LaTex expert either, so I wonder if it
REALLY needs more memory or I should use some other more efficient way
of doing it in R, for instance instead of pictex ??.

I'll appreciate your feedback.

orlando

Subject: [R] Neophyte question re using dyn.load and accessing c functions
Message-ID: <372361E2.3BA7A9F8@enteract.com>

I'm have what's probably a trivial &| silly problem trying to access a
c-function in a shared
library ( R 0.64, under redhat linux 5.2).

    R COMPILE rctest.c
    R SHLIB -o libRC.so rctest.o

produce a reasonable looking shared library ('nm libRC.so' shows that
the function 'rctest' is present).

In R, the command

    dyn.load("/fullpathname/libRC.so")

returns without an error.  However, I'm unable to access the function.
E.g.

    is.loaded(symbol.C("rctest"))

yields FALSE.

    .C("rctest",x)

yields "Error in .C("rctest", x) : C/Fortran function not in load table"

There must be something I'm leaving out, but after searching the
documentation and
help archive, I'm stuck.  Does the .so have to be in an R package (if
so, where)?

Thanks,

I'm not sure what you mean by "catch". I don't think that repeat catches
anything. If you want to know where you were when the error occured then
traceback(), immediately after the error will provide you with the call
stack.
You can use debug and browser to try to track it down.

If on the other hand hand you're asking about a "real" error catching
mechanism, then the answer is no. I am working on improving the current
state of affairs somewhat and there is some potential for error
catching but it may involve a large amount of rewriting of the code
to make it safe to do so though.

If you could provide a concrete example of what you want it would
be easier for people to help you.

Well when this happens to me it's usually because R configured incorrectly
and decided to either prepend (or not) an underscore when it wasn't (or
was) needed. 
Stepping through the code using a symbolic debugger will let you know
what's going on (or you could try recompiling with
HAVE_NO_SYMBOL_UNDERSCORE, set to the correct value for your machine).

Just to point out that tests almost nothing (at present). You can have
a library that loads with unresolvable symbols that will throw you out of
R when you try to use the symbol.  About the only think it tests is the
presence of the library file.

You can test if the configuration is right by

library(mva)
example(cmdscale)

If that fails it is the system configuration: if it works it is your
example, about which we will need to know more to help....

(This is such a common system for R it is hard to imagine that
configure did not work, but there is always a first time.)

Bump tex's memory up a tad:

first - find the texmf.cnf file (use kpsewhich if you have it:)
$ vi `kpsewhich texmf.cnf`

find the lines that deal with main memory.  You can get a clue as
to what needs the bump by looking in the log after trying tex.
I would bump both the "main_memory" line and the "extra_mem_bot"
line.  

After you have finished editing the file, run "texconfig init" and 
you should be good to go.

Subject: [R] random sequence
Message-ID: <0FAS00HIDRIZW5@hermes.ucd.ie>

Dear All,
How can I get the same stream of random numbers in R and S?

I know one of the generators in R is Super-Duper also used in S-plus,
but the .Random.seed's are set differently. I tried to re-exrpess 
that in S-plus into two seeds according to the formula in VR,
but I can't get the same random stream in R. 

Thanks,

Sorry, but no, it isn't quite the same as I understand them. S-PLUS
skips members of the sequence occasionally. But it depends what you
mean here: S-PLUS != S and I very much doubt you have S.

I don't know why you want to do this: if you use any of the built-in
operations (such as rnorm) you will get different answers as different
algorithms are used.  If all you want is a stream of runif() type,
implement your version on both systems to be sure.

Subject: [R] building packages under NT - missing headers? 
Message-ID: <3724CB37.D975D319@ucsd.edu>

I'm attempting to build an R package for some of my own code (using NT
x86, rw0640, cygwin b20.1)

The problem is that some header files required to build libR.seem to be
missing from the distribution

$ make libR.a
dataentry.c:20: Defn.h: No such file or directory
dataentry.c:21: Print.h: No such file or directory

These files were not part of the rw0640s archive,  but I note that they
exist in the 'official' R source -  and I had no problems building the
package with the previous  release  (633)

Any ideas what I have missed?

Thanks for the help

The code to support this is present in main.c.  To compile this in,
place the line

	#define SHELL_ESCAPE

at the top of src/main/main.c.

Using "!" in this way is syntactically ugly and it was a general decision
to not make this a standard R feature (but I left the code in because I
"knew" someone would ask ...).

To build libR.a you need the rw0640sp (not rw0640s) distribution: it is the
latter that is intended for package builders, as the readme.packages says.
This was true for rw0633 too. rw0640sp.zip should include the include files
and R.exp, which is what is trying to be built here.

Let us know privately if you have any further problems.

You can do this faster in C/Fortran, of course, but the load/save of the 
seed is slow from compiled code and in pure S I get over 1000 unifs/sec.

Janusx,
thanks for your help.as you suggested I am including 2 files, one with the .R code I
am using, the other with the latex example. I hope you have better luck.

In any case, I am now suspecting my R is not working well, because I was not able to
workout this example using the

> source("test1.R")

my version only wants to accept interactively commands ....therefore, whatever your
luck with this file, I wonder how to upgrade to 0.64 if it is worth....I dont find
much info on how to actually do an upgrade, is it the same as a fresh installation
??....do I have to delete 0.63 or what ??.

My 0.63 for Linux I took it from the binaries, I have never used the sources, so I am
a bit sceptical, but if is easy enough, and I get the "recipe" to do it , I may !!.

thanks again for your feedback !!.

Subject: [R] Memory management 
Message-ID: <3725B83E.59A5C93E@durham.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I don't get it:
First of all, the help doesn't say what are the memory limits of
R. Say, what's the max heap size for instance ????

Secondly,  I invoke R with the following commands each time:

rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 1000K
rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 2000K
rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 3000K
rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 4000K

I try to open a matrix 8000x8000 by issuing

x<-matrix(nrow=8000,ncol=8000)

I  always get the following message:

Error: heap memory (20480  Kb) exhausted [needed 250000 Kb more]

It's always 250000 Kb less. Although gc() reports the memory management
as
expected (correctly ?), increased every time I invoke R with greater
vsize,nsize
params. My matrix should hold roughly 1 Meg of memory.
Is this correct ?

When I issue :

rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 5000K

R hangs up and have to kill the session.

I am using R on a 333 Celeron Pentium PC with 128Megs of memory
under windows 98. I don't think I should have a problem there. Hardware
seems ok...

Would the interpreter normally use the swap disk to
create a ramdrive for extra memory needs ? When I use
large vsize, nsize params there is an awful lot of disk swapping...
This is more obvious on slower pentiums.

I'd hate to recompile R to enlarge the heap. Is there another
way out of it ? Anything undocumented ?

Thanks for your time and attention.

Best regards,
Costas

it's --vsize that controls the heap...

I get 8000*8000*8 = 512000000 bytes, alias 488Meg...

Subject: [R] C wrapper syntax?
Message-ID: <000701be90c7$35421f10$23709fc1@fenris>

I would like to make a windows version of "dataentry" which should be a
simple dialog box with one of the available MFC based grid control.
This got me interested in the wrapping code used to call C functions.
Although most of the syntax can be derived from existing code, I would be
interested if there is a more formal specification.

Peter's arithmetic is correct.  By default R stores numeric values
in double precision (32-bit integers are the other possibility).

There are 8000*8000 elements in the matrix, each occupying 8 bytes
(the size of a double).

This is a very large matrix.  R isn't designed to handle problems on this
scale (not many interactive systems are).  If you really want to try
problems of this scale, you'd be better off trying Fortran or C.

rm config.cache perhaps? configure should check whether you have
__setfpucw and conditionalis accordingly.

Thanks, Peter! It worked ok, also 'make check'. I had a config.cache
from the old times with RH5.2 hanging around. This suggests that there
are differences between RH5.2 and RH6.0 that matters for us  R  users
(or that I missed something in the installation of RH6.0).

Another beginner's question. Still trying trying to read and and plot a simple

	See my problem? Chron has thrown the 1900 bit away.
	Is there a way I can prevent this?

> julian(months(x[1]),days(x[1]),years(x[1]))

	Now. julian is that negative monstrosity iso 10224.

How do I cure this problem

Um: there is no such version. R 0.64.0?

That is a logical error. Because Martin M put backwards compatibility code
in, all initial .Random.seed of length 3 are taken to be mistakes for the
earlier specification of the Wichmann-Hill generator. Although the 
help page does not say so, both "Marsaglia-Multicarry" and "Super-Duper"
need seeds of length 3.  However, this does not apply if you have
already successfully set the RNG kind. So the work-around is

> RNGkind("Marsaglia-Multicarry")  # or .Random.seed <- 1
> .Random.seed <- c(1, 1:2)
> runif(5)
[1] 0.5641106 0.2932388 0.6696743 0.9174765 0.1490988

The rest of the examples I think come in the same way: it depends
on what has been set before. I'll look into it, but I don't think
anyone anticipated that one would swap generators during a session.

[Martin: I am about to commit some fixes.]

Subject: [R] R-0.64.0 installation on SGI IRIX 6.5  machine
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.96.990429144645.14968A-100000@cs>

Hi,

I am trying to install R-0.64.0 version on SGI machine running
IRIX 6.5.

Machine details:
319 <mind.krasnow.gmu.edu:R-0.63.3> uname -a
IRIX64 mind 6.5 07271714 IP27

Configure script runs fine and the output at the end of configure is:

R is now configured for mips-sgi-irix6.5

  Source directory:         /usr/local/R-0.64.0
  Installation directory:   /usr/local
  C compiler:               gcc -g
  FORTRAN compiler:         /usr/local/bin/g77  
  Gnome support enabled:    no


I am using gcc (egcs1.1.1) and g77 combination.
I use the GNU make(version 3.77) rather than the sgi make.
I went through your help mailing list and found that
I have to edit the Mathlib.h file in src/include directory
to undefine certain definitions which conflict with sgi's
definition.

When I run "gmake test", it fails; the details are given below.

....................

gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/R-0.64.0/tests'
gmake: [test-All] Error 2 (ignored)
***********************************

The test that fails from the simple-test.Rout file is

> Meps <- .Machine $ double.eps
> abs(1- .Machine$double.xmax * 
       10^(-.Machine$double.max.exp*log10(2)))/Meps < 1e3

According to the file the test should return true but get a false on this
machine.

I ran R and printed the list of objects:

.....
.Machine 
List of 14
 $ double.eps           : num 2.22e-16
 $ double.neg.eps       : num 1.11e-16
 $ double.xmin          : num 2.23e-308
 $ double.xmax          : num 1.80e+308
 $ double.base          : int 2
 $ double.digits        : int 53
 $ double.rounding      : int 2
 $ double.guard         : int 0
 $ double.ulp.digits    : int -52
 $ double.neg.ulp.digits: int -53
 $ double.exponent      : int 11
 $ double.min.exp       : int -1022
 $ double.max.exp       : int 1024
 $ integer.max          : int 2147483647
......

All these outputs match with the numbers I found on the help mailing list.

Can someone tell why the test returns false? Should I be using some other
combination (sgi cc instead of gcc) to make this test work?

Thanks,

Jayshree Sarma

The interesting bit of information missing from your post is what the 
actual value of the left hand side of that comparison is. On
Linux/i386 I get 560. If you get 1001 (say), I wouldn't worry too
much, but if it's some wild number, then you may be in deeper trouble.
(e.g. if log10(2) is not calculating the right value).

Subject: [R] Question on the idiom: start <- coef; start[fit$pivot] <- coef
Message-ID: <37295D9B.564100A0@enteract.com>

I wonder if someone could  explain how the following R idiom works (it's
used in
glm.fit).

    start <- coef
    start[fit$pivot] <- coef

coef is a vector of coefficients, set by  .Fortran("dqrls", ...).
fit$pivot is a vector of integer indexes (indicating how dqrls permuted
the columns
of x).  If coef has n elements, fit$pivot is a permutation of seq(1,5).

start[fit$pivot] is simple enough, but the assignment performs a futher
permuation
that I don't understand.  For example

> pivot <- c(1,3,4,2,5)
> a <- c(100,200,300,400,500)
> b <- a
> b[pivot] <- a
> b
[1] 100 400 200 300 500


I guess there must be a replacement function for [], but I haven't
been able to dig up any documentation on it (and I'm not quite sure
where
to look in the source code).   I'd like to understand what R does when a
vector
is assigned to another vector in this way.

Thanks,
(and thanks for all the other help I've gotten from member of the list
lately)

Subject: [R] Graphs

I am trying to use the Windows version of R to do the following:
-	Have a Delphi front-end which gets the user input
-	Delphi will produce a R script, do a system call to R to 	
	calculate the statistics.
	Is there a better way? Maybe a library one can use in Delphi or 
	Visual C?
-	How do one see a graph? A graph is plotted in a window which 
	IMMEDIATELY closes afterwords so that one can't see 
	anything. How can one get the graph to show until user 
	presses a key.

I wouldn't try looking in the source code for something as fundamental as
this. It is simple:

b[c(1,3,4,2,5)] <- a

replaces the first element specified on the lhs by the first specified on
the rhs, etc. So it means	

b[1] <- 100; b[3] <- 200; b[4] <- 300; b[2] <- 400; b[5] <- 500

and this permuting (or reversing a permutation) is the key idea.

Understanding indexing in S is one key to unlocking its power: section 2.8
of Venables & Ripley might be a good place to look for a full description.

Not yet! If you look back in the recent R-help archives you will see
a report on future plans for R for Windows.

You did something to make the window close, for example had EOF in the
script. If my guess is right, don't do that. Two ideas:

(1) call locator(1) at the point you want a wait. Then the user has to
click on the graph to continue.

(2) run R at the end of a pipe. Then you can send EOF when you are done
with R, or dev.off() when you are done with the graphics window. I have
no idea if Delphi supports pipes correctly. The --ess flag in R is
designed to simplify its use at the end of a pipe from NTemacs.

I have problems compiling R (both 0.63.3 and 0.64.0) on a DEC-UX 4.0E alpha

given in PLATFORMS, without any significant improvement...

I have included the config.cache aswell.

Any suggestions on how to solve this ?

Thanx!

I plan to do something similar.  I will use Tcl/Tk as a user interface
front-end to R.  The program will interact with the user via a Tk user
interface and send the appropriate R commands to R using expect.

Unfortunately, expect runs only on Unix and WinNT, as far as I know.
My platform is Sparc/Solaris.

This wouldn't happen using expect because there would be two processes:
the Tcl/Tk/expect user interface program and a separate R process.

  Given below is the output from R.  I do not get 560 but a rather large
number.  I ran the individual pieces too so you can compare the output
with the output from your machine and maybe tell me which is one that is
wrong. Is the code within abs()  correct?

In legend() is it possibly to mix lines and boxes?  I would like to do
something like 

  legend(locator(1), legend = c("al", "ben", "chris", "dave"), lty =

to indicate that "al", "ben" and "chris" have lines, and "dave" has a gray

Not quite, currently.

1) the fill colors currently must be integer (indexing into palette()).

2) Currently, either you get no or all boxes, <<--- to be improved by volunteer!
   since the 'fill' argument is only treated as scalar.
   Whereas this is easy to extend,
   much nicer (and more tedious) would be to NOT use "space" for a non-box
   and to NOT use space when there's no line

   (you probably understand what I mean, when looking at the following example).

Something *like* the above is possible with, e.g.,

	  plot(1)
	  legend(1,1, legend = c("al", "ben", "chris", "dave"),
	         lty = c(1, 2, 3, -1), fill = c(NA, NA, NA, 3))

Subject: [R] Memory management 
Message-ID: <3725B83E.59A5C93E@durham.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I don't get it:
First of all, the help doesn't say what are the memory limits of
R. Say, what's the max heap size for instance ????

Secondly,  I invoke R with the following commands each time:

rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 1000K
rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 2000K
rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 3000K
rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 4000K

I try to open a matrix 8000x8000 by issuing

x<-matrix(nrow=8000,ncol=8000)

I  always get the following message:

Error: heap memory (20480  Kb) exhausted [needed 250000 Kb more]

It's always 250000 Kb less. Although gc() reports the memory management
as
expected (correctly ?), increased every time I invoke R with greater
vsize,nsize
params. My matrix should hold roughly 1 Meg of memory.
Is this correct ?

When I issue :

rgui --vsize 30M --nsize 5000K

R hangs up and have to kill the session.

I am using R on a 333 Celeron Pentium PC with 128Megs of memory
under windows 98. I don't think I should have a problem there. Hardware
seems ok...

Would the interpreter normally use the swap disk to
create a ramdrive for extra memory needs ? When I use
large vsize, nsize params there is an awful lot of disk swapping...
This is more obvious on slower pentiums.

I'd hate to recompile R to enlarge the heap. Is there another
way out of it ? Anything undocumented ?

Thanks for your time and attention.

Best regards,
Costas

This is where the trouble starts. Other systems get a small number:
PD> 10^(-.Machine$double.max.exp*log10(2))
[1] 5.562685e-309

This underflow is probably no big deal, just an indication that your
system might not do perfect IEEE-standard arithmetic. Martin Maechler
may have more information on this.

Er, in what sense is Solaris not a Unix variant??? Or did you refer to
Geldenhuys being on W95?

Anyways, Guido Masarotto has a nice little "proof of concept" thing on
how to set things up so that you can call R commands directly from
Tcl/Tk code. You may want to check it out. 

[There's a silly bug (in glibc) preventing it from working
on Linux machines (at least RedHat5.2) if you use localization
features (LC_CTYPE & friends), but that's probably getting cleaned up
in the near future with glibc 2.1, and perhaps portability need not
concern you for now]

Dear Alan, here's how to define a simple nxn Identity matrix:

n<-c(5)
 I <- matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=n)
I[row(I)==col(I)] <- 1
