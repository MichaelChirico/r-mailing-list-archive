I'm using R (0.62.3) with SuSE 5.3 without problems.

You can find my R- (and other stuff) RPMs prepared for SuSE 5.3 on my
Web server:

http://www-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/RPMS/uni-klu-suse/RByName.html

This RPM repository is generated with rpm2html, so it should help you
finding required packages (my R version needs libblas, this needs libF77
... and so on)

This is ok because libdxml does only exist on Digital Alpha machines. The
above message just illustrates the way "configure" works to determine if
a specific library exists: it tries to run a "cc -ldxml" and then parses
the error messages.

The include path -I/usr/X11R6/include was missing in your commandline. 

But more likely you have not installed the "xdevel"-RPM from your SuSE
CDs -- it contains these header files.

Dear R core, 
one small complain:
the output of pbinom (and pnorm too) is
not easy to read when the numbers are in the exponent
form due to lack of spacing between numbers.

Try pnorm( (-10:10)/2 )

>> ... problems with R and SuSE ...


I should have mentioned that I am using a different approach to build my
RPM packages of R (available at http://www-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/RPMS):

+ I put every additional library in an extra package.
+ All packages are split into a "binary" and "source tree" part
  (R-somelibrary.i386.rpm and R-somelibrary-devel.i386.rpm)
  So if someone does not need the sources, he can omit the
  "devel"-packages.

I do so because this makes it easier for me to maintain  the
campus-wide R installation and to stay up to date.

A minimal R installation with sources needs the packages "R-0.62.3" and
"R-devel-0.62.3" and additionally "blas-dynamic", "f2c-shared" and
"readline-shared". 

Albrecht

PS:
We have also an RPM repository for Digital Unix freeware:
ftp://ftp.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/uni-klu.ac.at/rpms/osf1/alpha/RPMS/
It contains the same R-RPMs for DEC Alpha machines. But of course you will
need to install many other packages first to get rpm up and running on DEC
Unix (4.0D).

Subject: R-beta: dyn.load() on a Linux Red Hat 3.0.3 system
Message-ID: <m3pvccwgn6.fsf@sade.uio.no>

I'm trying to install R on a Red Hat 3.0.3 system, but cannot seem to
get dyn.load() to fuction.

The configure script says:

    checking for dlopen in -ldl...  no

And compiling fails at 

    ../lib/libunix.a

Any suggestions?  What should I do to be able to use dyn.load()?  I
cannot upgrade the system to a higher version of Red Hat, but I will
probably get away with installing some new libraries.

Thanks for any help.

The binary format for RedHat 3 was the "a.out" format, I believe.
Since RedHat 4 the binary format has been ELF.  The dlopen and related
functions depend on the ELF format.  I don't think you have a chance
of using dyn.load() in R unless you re-write all the dynload utilities
in the src/unix section of the R source code to use the older style of
dynamic loading under Linux.

  FG> I cannot upgrade the system to a higher version of Red Hat, but
  FG> I will probably get away with installing some new libraries.

Upgrading to a later version would be the easiest way of getting
dyn.load().  All the other methods of trying to use dyn.load() are
very difficult.  Mixing ELF libraries with a.out libraries on the same
system is quite tricky.  You would need to install new compilers, a
new loader, a new ld.so, ... to be able to use the new libraries.  You
would end up doing as much work as is involved in the upgrade.  It is
easy to make your system unusable while trying to use an ELF ld.so on
an a.out system.  (I know because I've done it. I had to reinstall
from scratch.)

If the reason that you do not want to upgrade is because you have
programs compiled for "a.out" libraries that you need to continue to
run, you should realize that it is possible to do that on ELF
systems.

I think RedHat 3.0 uses the a.out executable format and so
won't support the dlopen interface. If this is the case I don't
know what to recommend short of a complete reinstall.

I will do so, but first I should restructure my ftp server a little bit,
because there are many other RPMS not related to R in the same directory:

   ftp://pc02-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/RPMS/i386

Another problem could be, that my SuSE installations are 80% SuSE and 20%
self made RPMs, that means I should check my RPMs on 100% SuSE machines.

Yes, of course. It can be found at

   ftp://pc02-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/R/contrib/make-R-spec

I added a new command "R LIBINDEX" to $RHOME/etc:

   ftp://pc02-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/R/contrib/R-LIBINDEX.patch

This makes it easier to write the post install/uninstall scripts. May be
this could go into future R versions? 

Usage:

  make-R-spec package version release
 
e.g. "make-R-spec tripack 1.0 1"  generates R-tripack-1.0.spec

The resulting spec file has to be edited a little bit: 
+ Insert the contents from the TITLE file as description. 
+ Some packages have Makefiles, so you can use "make clean", others have
  not.
+ The prefix (usually /usr/local) can be changed.
 
It works for most libraries at CRAN, but for the VR packages I had to
create several subpackages manually, see my SRPM at

   ftp://pc02-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/SRPMS

I did not make any tests for speed, may be I should. I installed blas and
lapack libraries for other reasons and started later using them for R,
just because they where found by "configure".

This kind of thing is normal. Just configure's way of finding out that
you don't have that lib.

This, however, indicates that you're not set for compiling any X11
program, including R. I don't know SuSe very well, but I'd suspect that
you're missing an "X11-devel" package or something like that.

(R doesn't have the proper #ifdef's in to compile without X11,
although it probably should get them at some point.)

Jorge,

Puedes leer ingles?  Hay una introduccion a R entre los archivos en CRAN.  El
processo de escribir un programa y correrlo es demasiado cumplicado explicar
con email.  Este introduccion, llamado "Notes on R: A programming environment
for data analysis and graphics", presenta como utilizarlo en una manera muy
facil.  Se puede encontrar aqui.

http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/doc/Rnotes.ps.gz


Buena suerte,

Matt
P.S.  Yo creo que este listo (r-help) es oficialmente en ingles.

Subject: R-beta: R0.62.3 installation on RedHat 5.0
Message-ID: <199810070908.MAA14124@cc.oulu.fi>

I have R-0.62.3 and RedHat 5.0 with fort77.

At the office R is running but when I install a package, eg. 'akima'
I get a message
        make: f77: Command not found
'R INSTALL library' does not accept fort77, but R installation checks
f77/g77/fort77. Is there an easy way to edit some file and replace
f77/g77 with fort77?

At home I have the same R and Linux versions, but when installing R a
fatal error occurs after
        /lib/libmath.a -ISM -lICE -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -ldl -lm
        /usr/bin/fort77: Illegal option: -export-dynamics
        make[3]: *** [R.binary] Error 255

The fortran compiler to use is defined in the file $RHOME/etc/Makeconf
(Type "R RHOME" to find the R home directory). If you change the line
FC=f77 to FC=fort77 this should work. The value of FC is set when
you compile R, so you should only get this problem if you have copied
your R installation from another machine, or you have installed the
R RPM.

Fort77 isn't really a fortran compiler, but a perl script which acts as a
frontend to f2c. In principle it should recognize the -export-dynamics
option and pass it onto gcc, but it doesn't.  If you remove fort77
("rpm -e fort77") and rerun configure, R compiles quite happily with f2c.

So, the configure script probably shouldn't look for fort77. It
was never really needed (mea culpa) and now that it doesn't work
at all, should probably be taken out.

I had the same problems, by default the rpm egcs-f77 (or something to this
effect, I did a search on f77 in all RPM files) does not get installed so
it used fort77 and died with the error you mentioned. Install the f77 RPM
and the build should go painless(it did for me).
Hope this helps.

Looks like you need to install 
a) the X development package
b) ncurses

cf.:

$ rpm -qf /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so
XFree86-devel-3.3.2-13
$ rpm -qf /usr/lib/libncurses.so.3.0
ncurses3-1.9.9e-5

It seems R does not install completely with fort77. I am able to run
a demo, but when I study more carefully $RHOME/bin is empty: there is
no R binary or a shell script?

Last night I istalled g77 and I had no problems with the installation
procedure with g77.

You need to install the package ncurses3-1.9.9e-5, as stated in
the README file.

Between 5.0 and 5.1, RedHat changed the ncurses library from version 3.0
to version 4.0. In order to produce an rpm which runs on both RedHat
5.0 and 5.1, I linked R binary against the earlier version of ncurses.
This means that if you are running RedHat 5.1 you must install the
ncurses3 package, which is provided for backward compatibility.

The version of libncurses you found is another library provided for
backward compatibility with programs that were linked against libc5,
which was used in version 4.x of RedHat.

As to why ncurses 3.0 is linked to ncurses 1.9.9e, this is a long
story. You are not the only one who is confused.

Dear all,

Many thanks to those prompt and helpful replies, which immediately
bring me to the final stage.

A minor problem now:
I got the following message for smooth function during compilation on
both DEC-alpha and RedHat5.1.  Although the compiling went through, it
does not have the function of 'smooth' which is quite useful for me.
Any ideas?

These are only warnings from DEC ld when it creates shared objects. You
can supress them with LDFLAGS containing "-expect_unresolved *", you have
to find out how to mask the star * properly, may be you have to insert
"\*" or "\\\*" in your config.site file.

But you should simply ignore these messages. After loading the eda library

It works on my Alpha (Digital Unix 4.0D)

I haven't found a way to store projects. 
In Splus I know where things are stored

You cannot use attach to attach

Any help will be appreciated.

R objects are held in memory.  All data objects are saved to a disk file
when you exit from R [you will see a little message asking if you want
to save them].  This is holdover from an original desire to have R run on
Diskless Macs.  I am looking into fixing it now.

You can use the "save" and "load" functions to save groups of data
objects and then reload them.

Doing this like attaching directories (and other kinds of data objects
(such as NetCDF etc) are planned, but don't hold your breath.

In-Reply-To: <Pine.GSO.3.96.980917063426.11242A-100000@localhost>

Hi,

It has been recently reported that dyn.load doesn't work on Win95a but
does on b and c (see Prof Ripley's quote below).  I originally had
version a but it did dyn.load, although occasionally complained.  During
this time I could build R and all demos etc worked fine, plus could make
new Fortran and C DLL's and interface OK (this being my main interest
with R).  Inexplicably though, dyn.load suddenly stopped working (with
the reported error below).  I used Guido's R0.62.3 throughout.

I had been intending to upgrade hardware and Win95 anyway so this seemed
a reasonable time.  I am now running Win95 4.00.950 B and my hardware
upgrade is to 333MHzK2 (was 100MHz Cyrex), 64MBRam (was 16MB), HD1.5GB
unchanged.

Now that I am running version B, the problem remains.

1) With build using Mumits Mingw version 1.02, R starts OK but when
attempting to dyn.load results in the following error...

        demo(dyn.load)
        ---- ~~~~~~~~

Type  <Return>   to start : 

> dyn.load(paste(getenv("RHOME"), "demos/dynload/zero.dll", 
            sep = "/")) 
Error in dyn.load(x) : unable to load shared library "C:\R-
0.62.3/demos/dynload/zero.dll"
> 

(Other demo's work ok)


2) With build using Mumits Mingw version 1.1, R fails on startup with...

The graphics window doesn't open in this case.

Typing demo(dyn.load) results in the same error message.
If demo(graphics) given, graphics window opens, no output to it, and
same message.

I agree with the comment that the cross-compiled version supplied by
Guido in the binary distribution works OK.

To see if Mingw32 v1.1 didn't have the dyn.load problem, I took the DLL
built with Mingw1.1 locally and substituted it for Guido's cross-
compiled version.  I then ran the full binary distribution cross-
compiled R.exe with the locally built DLL (Mingw ver 1.1).  This
resulted in the "cann't load" error as before.




In conclusion it would seem...

a) dyn.load does not work (on all) Win95 version B systems (and I
suspect version C as well). Dyn.load did work inconsistently on version
A with me but suddenly stopped.  Therefore it is probably correct to say
that later versions of Win95 do not cure the dyn.load problem.

b) building with Mingw32 version  1.1 results in an additional error,
and has been reported by Prof Ripley, dyn.load still doesn't work

c) only the cross-complied version works properly

You need to install the emacs package "ESS" (= Emacs Speaks Statistics).
(works under both Emacs & XEmacs).
You find it at any CRAN site, under   src/other/ess/.
Installation instructions are included.

There's a mailing list for ESS,  ess-help at stat.math.ethz.ch,
in case you have problems in installation or usage of ESS.

Subject: R-beta: dyn.load update
Message-ID: <Ez5xcRAvl7H2EwKk@dsteele.demon.co.uk>

Hi Guido,

As you may have seen from my other message, I am now running Win95 B but
am still getting the dyn.load failure already reported.  So far as I can
see, the problem is in the DLL files, not the R.exe.

I have two versions, your version built with the cross-compiler, and one
built with Mingw32 version 1.02 (1.1 has an additional problem).  Your
cross build version works fine.  My locally built one results in the
following previously reported error...

        demo(dyn.load)
        ---- ~~~~~~~~

Type  <Return>   to start : 

> dyn.load(paste(getenv("RHOME"), "demos/dynload/zero.dll", 
            sep = "/")) 
Error in dyn.load(x) : unable to load shared library "C:\R-
0.62.3/demos/dynload/zero.dll"
> 

When I substitute your cross-built zero.dll into the binaries I have
built locally, it (demo(dyn.load)) works OK.  Conversely when I insert
my locally built zero.dll into your binary distribution, the error is
then reproduced.  (When library dll's are similarly exchanged, same
result).

Therefore the problem seems to be the DLL's

The zero.dll files are the same length; 4096.  However, if one obtains a
od -c on both files, and then looks at the diff, the files are clearly a
"bit" different.  The following is an extract from the beginning of the
diff output...

At which point I come to a halt due to my lack of knowledge on compilers
and DLL's etc.  

(Are the discrepancies at the termination of strings or lines.  Given
the unix/dos difference in string termination, I was wondering if this
might be the problem)

What do you think ?

Subject: [R] SuSe does not like more.
Message-ID: <98101310503002.00264@for>

In R "help(package=pkg)" or "library(help=pkg)" seems to behave
like 'more' or 'less' or something that looks like one of these.

Under RedHat this behaves normally: at the end of help it reverts
automatically to the R prompt '>'.
In SuSe it doesn't jump back to the prompt automatically:
I see something like "line 1/28 (end)" and then I have to type
a 'q' just like with 'less'. The result is that the help text
disappears.

This is rather irritating. Can somebody explain what might be
happening so that I can attempt to fix it if possible.

Subject: [R] Assembler messages?
Message-ID: <98101310274500.00264@for>

Up to now I have got the base R and about half of the packages
working on SuSe Linux 5.3 using gcc, g77 and xdevel.

The other half, for example: pspline, logspline, KernSmooth, akima,
tripack, ppr, principal.curve, cluster, funfit, repeated, event, etc.,
just won't install.
Some of them give warnings at expressions in subroutines (repeated,
event, pspline,etc.. I will ask about this in another mail) but a number
give 'Assembler messages'.

Of these I will quote an install log for 'akima' in full:

...........................................................................

I am using akima_0.2-3.tar.gz downloaded from 'tuwien'.

Sounds as if SuSE is having more aliased to less (or sets the PAGER
env. variable)? The screen clear "feature" of less can be disabled by
the LESS environment variable.

Try 

LESS=-XE R

This is a bug in g77 from SuSE 5.3 (I already reported it to the SuSE
mailing list, but there was no useful answer)

You can circumvent the errors and change them into "assembler warnings"
with "-O2" added to your CFLAGS (in site.conf)

You get now warnings like

g77 -fpic -O2  -c dgedi.f 
/tmp/cca27296.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/cca27296.s:172: Warning: warning: unrecognized characters
`@GOTOFF(%ebx)' in expression
... repeated many times

But the resulting shared object works!

It is the combination of -fpic and -g that causes the error, this was also
the case with some older versions of SuSE, but with SuSE 5.2 and "-fpic
-O2 -g" no errors and no warnings were produced.


May be, we (SuSE users) should change to egcs? 


Albrecht

PS:
It occurs not on every Fortran file, one example is dgedi.f from netlib.

Hello!

I had just the same "Assembler" Messages during the Installation of the 
cluster-Package by Kurt Hornik. It seems to be a Bug in the g77 code resp. 
somebody told me that there is a bug in some program in sbin which causes these 
messages. I fixed the problem by using f2c instead of g77 -- that works fine! 
So I would recommend users with SuSe to use f2c for installing R.

Yours Winfried Theis

Albrecht,

I am sorry to have to trouble you again but I looked in 'config.site'
(I take it that you mean 'config.site' where you say 'site.conf') and
this is what I found with respect to CFLAGS and FFLAGS:

# Debugging and optimization options for the C compiler.
# Use this to specify CFLAGS for the version of the C compiler specified
# above.  If unspecified, defaults to "-g -O2" for gcc, and "-g" in all
# other cases.
# CFLAGS=  

# Options for the FORTRAN compiler.
# Use this to specify FFLAGS for the version of the compiler specified
# above.  If unspecified, defaults to "-O2" for g77, and "" otherwise.
# FFLAGS=                                                            

So I think this means that the default values for both gcc and g77 are
already set to "-g -O2".

Would specifying them anyway make any difference or am I misunderstanding
you completely?

Thank you for the reply.
You were right of course, SuSe sets PAGER=less.
So LESS=-XR R works perfectly.

So I take it that R uses 'more' to pipe output to the screen?

More precisely: $RHOME/cmd/pager which in turn looks at $PAGER:

$ more cmd/pager 
#!/bin/sh
pager=${PAGER-"more -s"}
if [ "$1" != "" ]
then exec $pager < $1
else exec $pager
fi
# For the curious: "pager $1" doesn't work in batch, because "more" will
# eat the rest of stdin. The no-argument version is intended for use 
# at the end of a pipeline.


[If you want less -XE as default for R - e.g. to be able to scroll
back - you might add 

PAGER="less -XE" 

to the bin/R startup script]

Yes, you are right -- sorry. You have to change the FFLAGS, not the
CFLAGS in config.site: 

    FFLAGS="-g -O2"

So now for the $100.000 stupid question:

After having installed half of the contrib packages using g77
can I expect any problems if I try to install the other
half using f2c?

After mucking around with this compiler/linker/assembler and
what have you stuff for a couple of weeks I am becoming very
suspicious :-)
Give me mathematics any day.

I tried it last night and this is the result:

This is what I got first when FFLAGS was the default (remmed out):

This is what I get when using FFLAGS="-g -O2" in config.site:

libs
f77 -fpic -c idcldp.f -o idcldp.o
/tmp/cca00570.s: Assembler messages:

/tmp/cca00570.s:891: Error: operands given don't match any known 386 instruction
make: *** [idcldp.o] Error 1

Other errors but still no result!
As I don't understand exactly what is happening I don't know if there
is any progress.

Not likely. Unless of course the packages installed with a broken g77
start acting up on you. They'd do that anyway of course.

I'd consider a reinstall of egcs/g77/binutils from scratch.

...at least there you can stare people in the face and claim "this

Message-ID: <199810141249.IAA28771@sirocco.cc.mcgill.ca>

Hi, I am relatively new to R programming. I have Guido's version on a 
Win95 Pentium with 32 Mb RAM.
I tried to compile the Package MIXREG of Rolf Turner in S to R
almost everything works OK but he has a function po = partial outer 
product as follows:
po <- function(a,b) {
array(apply(b,2,"*",a),dim=c(dim(a),dim(b)[2])))   }
in S-Plus given
x = ( 1 1
      1 2
      1 3
      1 4 )
po(x,x) gives
[,,1] = 1  1
        1  2
        1  3
        1  4
[,,2] = 1  1
        2  4
        3  9
        4  16
ie a collection of flats of outer products, now in R the same 
function gives an error for un conmensurable arrays. I have to re-
write po as
po <- function(a,b) {
  bb <- array(0,dim=c(dim(a),dim(b)[2])                
  for (i in 1:dim(a)[1]) {
     bb[i,,] <= outrer(a[i,],b[i,]) }
  bb
}
Am I missing something? . The help files for 'apply' in R and is S+ 
are exaclty the same, but the implementations obviously are 
different. . .

Another, tring again to port FUNFITS i get a lot of errors for 
missing i-o something, I deleted all the 'write(*,*)' from the 
fortran sources but there remain some 'write(2,*)...' writings to 
temporary files which the compiler library does not like. I am using 
MINGW32 1.02
Is there a way to bypass this error and add the proper library to the 
link list?
Thanks to all.

Hello R-ists

Have been lurking on the list for a while, I have noticed recently two
problems:

1	There seem to be problems with installing R on SuSe Linux
version 5.3.  As the list only gets problems and doesn't log the
successes, has anyone successfully loaded R on SuSe 5.3?  Is this a
feature of 0.62.3 only or do the problems apply also to earlier versions.

2	There was a list of outstanding problems from Jim Lindsey that
have appeared in 0.62.3 that were not there on 0.62.1.  

I need to upgrade from RH4.1 Linux and was proposing to use SuSe once the
YasT English problem is solved.  Upgrading is always quite a
time-consuming affair, particularly as I will copy /usr/local, /home and
/etc and rebuild completely.

So my question is, what R to load?  I still have 0.50 on my system and
need to upgrade, given that I will use SuSe 5.3.  Would you suggest I:

a	Load 0.62.3, the latest version
b	Load 0.62.1, which works with Jim's libraries
c	Wait a little for 0.62.3+x next release which will have these
fixed.

BTW can I suggest, after the recent RSS News article, that all
publications should reference the software used.  This should help to
promote R and to ensure that the valuable support from all the
institutions is retained since citations indexes would show how much it
was used. The correct reference for R was on the list a little while ago.

Hmmm.... R is a bit stricter than S when it comes to creating the
array slices in apply(). It seems that where S is doing x[,1]*x, R has
array(x[,1],4)*x which is not allowed in either language. 


I'm not sure which language has the bug and which one has the feature,
but a way out is

po <- function(a,b) {
array(apply(b,2,function(x,y)c(x)*y,a),dim=c(dim(a),dim(b)[2]))}
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Can you give us a bit more information about the RSS News article?  I
may have missed some messages but I don't recall previous reference on
this list to such an article.

It's a feature of SuSE only. Apparently it only affects some of the
contributed stuff and compiling with f2c solves it.

What's wrong with RH5.1?? You still need to rebuild /usr/local because
of the glibc thing, but most everything else upgrades quite smoothly.

For each new bug reported by Jim, there are tens of bugs fixed between
the two versions. Most of the items on his list were either his
*opinion* on things that he wants us to do differently, annoying
features that have been there all along, or items introduced for
S-plus compatibility. You don't want the bugs of 0.62.1, believe me.

You'll wait a long time for 0.62.4. Next version will be 0.63,
complete with its own set of nasty bugs brought about by internal
restructuring...

Actually, the correct reference for R would be the manual for the
relevant version. Unfortunately that's not a publication. As soon as
it get somewhere near complete, I hope that we can make sure that
each version (or at least the major ones) gets an ISBN number, etc.

I've downloaded rsept31.zip, unzipped it and have been able 
to run it under OS/2. When I start it I get an error (error 
no. 6) but the package seems to run just fine using OS/2 
Warp 4's Win-OS/2 version of Windows 3.1. (I always have to 
tell it wherre the rprofile is. Is that normal?)

I've tried to run the same Windows 3.1 version of R on a 
computer running Windows 3.1 (actually Windows for 
Workgrouops). But everytime I try to run it I get a message 
saying that the program is only for Windows NT. Does R need 
win32s?

Does anyone have a idea what is going on here? I don't 
understand why it would work under OS/2 and not under 
Windows.

Exactly.

There's a win32s somewhere in OS/2?

Thanks for straightening this out.

OS/2 either includes win32s or you can add one. (One problem is 
that Win-OS/2 only "supports" a win32s up to about version 1.25, I 
believe. This of course limits the programs that will run, like 
S-Plus Version 4.5 will not run because it requires a newer 
win32s.)

The NEWS file for 0.62.3 has a far longer list of outstanding problems in
0.62.1 that are fixed in 0.62.3, some of which are much more serious IMHO.

This does not come close to working with my libraries, and has (literally)
dozens of known errors that have been corrected by 0.62.3. (Even one of the
Lindsey examples, seq, is also wrong in 0.62.1, but in a more insidious
way.) 

I suggest you go for 0.62.3: it has the fewest known bugs of any version
(and the next version, 0.63, is not yet stable enough to surplant it, at
least for my tests).

Actually I had obviously mis-filed something in the RSS News brain
department - apologies to my good friend Frank!  Having scoured the
recent RSS News I couldn't find it either!

I was actually alluding to a brief discussion on Allstat about software at
the end of September started by a comment by John Nelder about a
statistical scandal.  Examples were given of analyses which referees could
not repeat either because they didn't have the data or the software or
both as well as the mis-use of packages. 

It is always possible to mis-use a program but I think it should become
mandatory on all Journal editors for articles to reference the software
used (and packages developed for the software).  Unless commercially
confidential, the data and procedure/macros should be publicly available.
This way, the excellent GPL and similar packages such as R and Octave that
are produced by people who care about the product rather than the profit
will get cited and the kudos will filter back to their (generally)
academic institutions. The other way of course is to publish a book but
that requires (a) time and (b) a final version of the program.

A year or so ago I was singed (a sort of lower case flame experience)  on
this list for suggesting that a financial mechanism could be set up to
channel funds to people like the core R team and the Octave developers.  I
use Linux not because it is nearly free but because it is reliable and by
far the best OS I have come across.  The same with R and Octave etc.  They
are actually (in their own way) as good as or better than the commercial
equivalents and the users are not paying for the road-shows, hotel bills,
marketing junkets etc that we all see at every conference.  Quality counts
in the end.

I don't know what the answer is but maybe citations is one way to keep the
products in focus.

Just a thought.  Apologies for being off-topic.

John

As John says, the RSS article was actually an Allstat article
attributed to John Nelder.  The precise www reference is

        http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/allstat/1998-09/0132.html

If you agree with John's philosophy (and on this point I
certainly do) it makes a useful point.

I have my own opinion on what the statistical package with the
"four letter acronym" name might be, but I could be wrong.

Subject: [R] scan with special separator and returns
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.981015144855.320B-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

I would like to run the follwing command in R 0.62.2:

all.scanned <- scan ("all.txt", what= character (), sep= ";")

Now my Problem is that the character fields separated by ; also contain
tabs and returns which I would like to conserve. The tabs are properly
translated into \t but the returns are taken to be field separators too.
When I change the returns into \n in the text file they become \\n after
being scanned. 

Is there some way around this?

By the way, are the r-lists archived?

Thanks and regards,

There's a reason why even the commercial guys (including Microsoft)
are dropping support for win32s...

It may be win32s version dependent (Guido's 0.61.3 port depended on
the *build number* as well! As far as I remember you need 1.30.172 for
that one and 1.30.166 won't work...)

I'm feeling kinda stupid right now, but I'm actually having problems

I'd be happy if someone could point out for me where to look to fix the

Hmm, haven't seen that variant before... There really is a bakslv in
appl/bakslv.c and in appl/uncmin.f which looks a bit unhealthy, but on
my RedHats, they should generate distinct symbols.

Which f77 is that? The egcs one or an f2c wrapper script or something
completely different? 

You may want to try one of

a) make distclean ; ./configure --with-f2c ; make

b) make distclean ; LDCMD=gcc ./configure --with-g77 ; make

or modify config.site accordingly. Not sure whether you need to set
the LIBS to include -lf2c as well in the latter case.

From wsimpson at uwinnipeg.ca  Fri Oct 16 20:02:23 1998
From: wsimpson at uwinnipeg.ca (Bill Simpson)

Subject: [R] mean and sd of each serial position
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.981016122938.5528A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I want to do something like this in R. If I have three vectors
> a1
[1] 1 2 3
> a2
[1] 4 5 6
> a3
[1] 9 10 7

I want to compute
1. A vector that is the mean at each serial position of a1, a2, and a3.
so in this example it would have the contents
4.667, 5.667, 5.333333

2. A vector that is the SD at each serial position of a1, a2, and a3.
so in this example it would have the contents
 4.041452, 4.041452, 2.081666

Can anyone tell me a good way to do this in R? The only thing I can come
up with is

meanvec<-function(a1,a2,a3)
{
temp<-numeric(3)
for(i in 1:3)
	temp[i]<-mean(c(a1[i],a2[i], a3[i]))
return(temp)
}

sdvec<-function(a1,a2,a3)
{
temp<-numeric(3)
for(i in 1:3)
	temp[i]<-sd(c(a1[i],a2[i], a3[i]))
return(temp)
}

If this simple-minded approach is the way to go, I wonder how to modify
these functions so I don't need to know the number of vectors ahead of
time. That is, make the same function do mean on 3 vectors, 10 vectors,
etc--just include all the vectors in the function call.

Thanks very much for any help.

 I think "apply" is what you're looking for ...

apply(rbind(a1,a2,a3),2,mean)
apply(rbind(a1,a2,a3),2,sd)


or making it into a function:

tmpf _ function(...) {
  x _ rbind(...)
  list(mean=apply(x,2,mean),sd=apply(x,2,sd))
}

Use apply():

cbind(a1,a2,a3) makes matrix

apply(cbind(a1,a2,a3),1,mean) computes the mean of each row of the matrix

In general you can do

    meanvec<-function (...) 
     	apply(cbind(...), 1, mean)

and then 
R> a1<-1:10  
R> a2<-2:11
R> a3<-3:12
R> meanvec(a1,a2,a3)
 [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11

This doesn't check that all the vectors are the same length. A more
sophisticated version is 
meanvec<-function (...) {
 if (length(unique(sapply(list(...),length)))!=1)
        stop("not all same length")
 apply(cbind(...), 1, mean)
}

R> meanvec(a1,a2,a3)     
 [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
R> a4<-1:3
R> meanvec(a1,a2,a3,a4)
Error: not all same length

These are the "parallel mean" and "parallel standard deviation"
functions that should be part of standard R.  There is already a
"parallel maximum" function, pmax(...), for example.  In fact
there should be quite a few of these available, such as psum,
pprod, pcumsum, pdiff, ..., so if anyone has the time, feel free.

Here are two versions of pmean().  The first should be good
enough if the entire structure fits into memory; the second,
pmean.large() might be better when dealing with truly huge
vectors.  pstddev() is left as an exercise...

"pmean" <- function (..., na.rm = FALSE)  {
  args <- do.call("cbind", list(...))
  nargs <- ncol(args)
  if (na.rm) {
    OK <- !is.na(args)
    args[!OK] <- 0
    n <- as.vector(matrix(as.numeric(OK), nrow(args), nargs) %*% 
                   rep(1, nargs))
  }
  else n <- nargs
  as.vector(args %*% rep(1, nargs))/n
}

"pmean.large" <- function (..., na.rm = FALSE) {
  elts <- list(...)
  k <- max(unlist(lapply(elts, length)))
  total <- rep(as.vector(elts[[1]]), length = k)
  if (na.rm) {
    n <- !is.na(total)
    total[!n] <- 0
  }
  else {
    n <- length(elts)
  }
  for (each in elts[-1]) {
    work <- rep(as.vector(each), length = k)
    if (na.rm) {
      m <- is.na(work)
      work[m] <- 0
      n <- n + !m
    }
    total <- total + work
  }
  total/n
}

Since the base language for R is C, I think it would be difficult to
call a C++ constructor or method directly from R.  R wouldn't know
about name mangling and things like that.

I have been successful dynamically loading C++ code on some systems by
ensuring that the function I will call is wrapped in

 extern "C" {

 }

then using .C(...).  That is, make sure the function you will call
from R is a standard C function then have it construct C++ objects,
invoke methods, etc.

Here is an earlier message in which I described this

 Message-ID: <6r3eo4soc3.fsf at franz.stat.wisc.edu>

 I have tried linking C++ code using the Template Numerical Toolkit
 version 0.8.3 (see http://math.nist.gov/tnt/) with R-0.50-a3 (see
 http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html).  I expected this to
 be very difficult.  It was very easy.  I was pleasantly surprised.
 Nice work by the developers all around.

 A bit of background for the R crowd: TNT, being developed by Roldan
 Pozo at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, is the
 successor to lapack++

 As the name indicates, all the representations in TNT are templated.
 The advantages of using it with R would be that one could obtain the
 execution speed of compiled linear algebra code without the
 corresponding hassle of keeping track of all the dimensions associated
 with matrix representations in Fortran.  All of us really love to
 write those calls that require
  A, LDA, M, N
 for each matrix being passed but some of us in the baby boomer
 generation are getting on in age and we lose track of the calling
 sequence at about the 12th argument :-)

 TNT creates all matrices as copies of the original content.  Because
 it is written in C++, it gracefully handles the releasing of the
 storage when the identifier goes out of scope.

 Here is a sample run on a Linux system
 $ cat R_link.cc
 // An example of linking the Template Numerical Toolkit 0.8.3 with R-0.50 
 // 
 #include "tnt.h" 
 #include "vec.h" 
 #include "fmat.h" 

 extern "C" { 
   static double * 
     copy_contents(double *dest, Fortran_matrix<double> A) 
     { 
       double *dd = dest, *src = &A(1,1); 
       int nn = A.num_rows() * A.num_cols(); 

       while (nn--) { *dd++ = *src++; } 
       return dest; 
     } 

   void my_mat_sum(double * A, double * B, long int * dims) { 
     Fortran_matrix<double> 
       AA(dims[0], dims[1], A),  // creates a copy 
       BB(dims[0], dims[1], B), 
       CC = AA + BB; 

     cout << "A on input: " << AA << endl; 
     cout << "B on input: " << BB << endl; 
     cout << "Sum: " << CC << endl;  
     copy_contents(A, CC);

This is not guaranteed to work on all systems because C++ may need
functions that are not available in the standard C libraries.
Especially the constructors and the destructors in C++ tend to require
some special run-time routines.

Subject: [R] Frequencies- and Crosstabs-Output like SPSS ???
Message-ID: <19981019214000.A207@debian>

				[Delayed and reposted by list maintainer

Hello,

I am looking for two R-functions that could generate an Output like SPSS.


1. An equivalent function for (SPSS) FREQUENCIES which generate
   something like this:
   
   
                            Valid     Cum
   Value Frequency Percent Percent   Percent
       1         1     5.3   5.6      5.6
       2         4    21.1  22.2     27.8
       3        11    57.6  61.1     88.9
       4         2    10.5  11.1    100.0
       0         1     5.3  Missing
              ----   -----  -------
       Total    19   100.0  100.0


Valid cases 18; Missing cases 1



2. An "extended-table-function" like SPSS CROSSTABS.
   The R-table-function shows only the observed values:
   
   > table(exam$sex, exam$tutor)
                   jane john
	  female    4    4
	  male      6    6
  
  
   The "extended-R-table-function" should also shows 
         - the expected values
	 - the row percentages
	 - the column percentages
	 - the total percentages
	 - the residuals
	 
   Maybe a function like: 
   
   table.extended(exam$sex, exam$tutor, expected=TRUE, row.perc=TRUE) 
   
   etc.
  
  

Who can help me?


Thanks,

Hello folks,

I can't make R use the GNU-Readline-library.

However,
- I have run configure with --enable-readline and
- configure *has found* the library.

My Linux distribution is SuSe, July 1998. I'm using
Kernel 2.0.25. I was told by Douglas Bates (r-devel),
that this problem between R and (probably) SuSe was
discussed before on this list.

Can someone tell me how I can make R use readline?

Karsten,

I have a function which might be too simple, but could be modified to
what you requested.  It is called "xtab" and appears to run okay on my
version of R (0.61.2).  The tar.gz file includes text coding for "xtab"
and "padding" which is called.  I set up empty functions and read the
text code into the editor, although there is probably a better way. 
Hope it helps.

There may be a version problem. R requires readline v.2.1 (shared
libname 3.0) or higher. Check the configure output where it looks for

rl_callback_read_char in -lreadline

If it doesn't find it, you probably need to upgrade readline.

I have downloaded the package modreg for R but when i doing  "R INSTALL modreg"
 I get_ errors.

With the packages akima, funfits, acepack,KernSmooth and othes i have the same
problem. Why??

I need R for working with calibration curves, and i dont know what is the best

I need some packages for fitting nonlinear models.

I would like install thes fuctions: rreg(); lmsfit(); l1fit(); and loess.
How i can download and install it?


Please help me.

Hello folks,

the problem with R not using GNU-readline is solved.
Thank you very much for your help!

Peter Dalgaard gave the hint that made it possible
for me to diagnose the problem:
...rl_callback_read_char in config.cache was set to =no

SuSe is normally a very fine Linux-distribution, but
readline 2.2 has to be installed manually

tapply() gets you a long part of the way:

> data(warpbreaks)
> attach(warpbreaks)
> tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),mean)
         L        M        H
A 44.55556 24.00000 24.55556
B 28.22222 28.77778 18.77778
> tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),sd)
          L        M         H
A 18.097729 8.660254 10.272671
B  9.858724 9.431036  4.893306
> tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),length)
  L M H
A 9 9 9
B 9 9 9

The tricky bit is printing it in a nicer layout. Something in the
right direction might be:

x<- tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),function(x)c(mean(x),sd(x),N(x)))
a<-array(c(x,recursive=T),c(3,2,3))
dimnames(a)<-c(list(c("Mean","SD","n")),dimnames(x))
aperm(a,c(1,3,2))

which gives:

, , A

            L         M        H
Mean 44.55556 24.000000 24.55556
SD   18.09773  8.660254 10.27267
n     9.00000  9.000000  9.00000

, , B

             L         M         H
Mean 28.222222 28.777778 18.777778
SD    9.858724  9.431036  4.893306
n     9.000000  9.000000  9.000000

Or you can play around with formatC like this:

> t.sd<-formatC(tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),sd),2,10,"f")
> t.mean<-formatC(tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),mean),2,10,"f")
> t.n<-formatC(tapply(breaks,list(wool,tension),length),0,10,"d")
> print(aperm(array(c(t.mean,t.sd,t.n),c(3,2,3),dimnames=
+ c(rev(dimnames(t.mean)),list(c("Mean","SD","n")))),c(3,1,2)),quote=F)
, , A

     L          M          H         
Mean      44.56      28.22      24.00
SD        18.10       9.86       8.66
n             9          9          9

, , B

     L          M          H         
Mean      28.78      24.56      18.78
SD         9.43      10.27       4.89
n             9          9          9

(If you don't grasp the dim and dimnames magic, don't despair: Neither
do I, I just fiddled with them till it worked... There's probably also
a more systematic approach.)

Probably due to the lack of a Fortran compiler: we need more infomation
on those errors.  Please send fuller details to R-devel (and I guess you
have a Linux box and I do not, so I will not be able to help you much).

I should say that modreg is not a public, supported package but a
test-release of code I have written intended for incorporation into R.
I was not aware that its existence was known to R-help: I only
sent information (once) to R-devel asking for comments on installation etc.

> With the packages akima, funfits, acepack,KernSmooth and othes i have the same

Probably because you have no functional Fortran compiler: all those and modreg
use Fortran.

> I need some packages for fitting nonlinear models.

Not much in R as yet: you could try minimizing the sum of squares or
maximizing the likelihood directly with nlm().

> I would like install thes fuctions: rreg(); lmsfit(); l1fit(); and loess.
> How i can download and install it?

Those are S-PLUS functions (except lmsfit: you probably mean lmsreg)
and are not part of R.  I know of no implementation of l1fit for R, nor do
think it would be worthwhile to make one.

loess is part of modreg.

rreg and lmsreg are provided as compatibility functions in my experimental
package lqs at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R. As this only uses C
you may be able to use it.  Note that I think the main functions there,
rlm and lqs, are much to be preferred to rreg and lmsreg, both in terms of the
statistics and in terms of the interfaces.

PLEASE: modreg and lqs are experimental, so feedback direct to me or to
R-devel only. In particular, lqs is not finalised yet.

A final comment: if you want so much of the `plus' of S-PLUS, why not
use it?  As I understand it, it is not a design goal of R to clone the
`plus', and there are serious copyright and other issues in trying to
do so.  (loess and rreg are part of S, AFAIK.)

As usual, it is available from the Auckland repository as of a few
minutes ago, but it is preferred if you wait until it trickles out
into your nearby CRAN site in a couple of days.

Yes, I know I said there wouldn't be any more 0.62's, but there's
still some way to go before 0.63 and it turned out that at least some
of the bugs could be fixed for the release version fairly easily.

There are still quite a few bugs (mainly memory handling ones) that
are fixed only in the development version, but unfortunately some new
ones have been added too. We're trying to get a stable version of 0.63
out in a couple of weeks.

Subject: [R] Installing a "package" of my own functions
In-Reply-To: <01bdfcdc$7115ca20$680e4c86@wreich>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.981026152223.11365A-100000@solzhenitsyn.ens.gu.edu.au>

I've just moved from R 0.49 to R 0.61 and I'm trying to get the functions
I've made to work as a package.

I created a directory called ~/mine/R and put all the functions I wanted in
as files called  name.R
I created files DESCRIPTION and TITLE in ~/mine 

Then as root I ran R INSTALL mine from ~
This gave :

solzhenitsyn:~king# R INSTALL mine
Installing package `mine' ...
R
DONE

No man pages found in package `mine'

On starting R I get the message 
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : syntax error on line 260

and the library doesn't seem to be there

What am I doing wrong?

Hi, I am trying to install R on my Ultra-10 running Solaris 2.6.1. and got
following massege when i configure.

# ./configure

The path of my C and FORTRAN complier is /opt/SUNWspro/bin. The path for
perl and bison, gcc(not sure if it is working) is /local/usr/bin, my dvips
and latex are mounted from
SUNOS machines. What should I do? Thanks in advance for your helps.

Subject: [R] Request for help with getting R to work on a DEC Alpha
Message-ID: <D0D9AB571768D211AA150008C74CF8E4027943@MERCURY>

I am currently attempting to install R on our DEC Alpha computer, and am
having a little trouble.

I have f2c installed in lieu of a Fortran compiler, and have installed
libf2c in a subdirectory below where f2c lives, although as you can see
below, libf2c is not being found during configuration. I'm not sure what I
would need to do to rectify this.

However, my main problem is with the 'make': I get the message "Don't know
how to make %.f", as you'll see below. I'm afraid that my Unix skills fail
me here.

Looking forward to receiving any help you can give. Please reply to:

Hi Everyone

Hope this is the right forum. I am sure it's obvious but .....

How do I get some sort of pattern on a boxplot? I have three groups
that are easy to give different colours but of course this isn't much
good for printing in black and white. Anyone written a clustered
boxplot (ala SPSS) which is the effect i'm after? 

Of course a pattern is what I'm really after as the clustered effect
is pretty easy to get

Thanks

Subject: [R] Unix R core dumps if $HOME is not set.
Message-ID: <199810271836.KAA23014@desire.rt.cs.boeing.com>

One of my colleagues was/is trying to run R via a WWW perl script.  The way 
our system is configured (and I have no control over this), he ends up 
in a process where the HOME environment variable is not set.  When he 
tries to run R all he gets is a core dump.

A regular user can verify this by just unsetting the HOME variable and 
trying to run R.

The problem is in the  system.c  file, in the following lines, 
  if (LoadInitFile) {
    if ((fp = R_fopen(".Rprofile", "r")))
      return fp;
    sprintf(buf, "%s/.Rprofile", getenv("HOME"));
    if ((fp = R_fopen(buf, "r")))
      return fp;
  }

I won't suggest a fix (because everyone has their favorite ways of 
dancing around error returns from system calls), but I think there 
needs to be a small test for a null return from getenv.

(Once I discovered this we "solved" the problem by setting the HOME 
variable in the perl script which calls R).

The following example is from `S Poetry', page 78-79.  It
seems to indicate some error in lapply, sapply, 
or both? [It does, and below the solution is given also.]



> jjalist <- list(matrix(c(1:4),2,2),

+                 matrix(c(2,5,8,4),2,2))
> jjblist <- jjalist  # data for example

> debug(sapply)
> debug(lapply)
> sapply( seq(along=jjalist), function(i,x,y) 
+    {x[[i]] %*% y[[i]]}, x=jjalist, y=jjblist)
debugging in: sapply(seq(along = jjalist), function(i, x, y) {
            x[[i]] %*% y[[i]]
}, x = jjalist, y = jjblist)
debug: if (is.character(FUN)) FUN <- get(FUN, mode = "function") else if
(mode(FUN) != 
            "function") {
            farg <- substitute(FUN)
            if (mode(farg) == "name") 
                    FUN <- get(farg, mode = "function")
            else stop(paste("\"", farg, "\" is not a function", sep =
""))
}
Browse[1]> n
debug: answer <- lapply(as.list(X), FUN, ...)
Browse[1]> n
debugging in: lapply(as.list(X), FUN, ...)
debug: if (is.character(FUN)) FUN <- get(FUN, mode = "function")
Browse[1]> FUN

[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] 2

[[3]]
[1] 3

            # FUN has captured the value of X???

Browse[1]> mode(FUN)
[1] "list"
Browse[1]> x

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4

[2,]    5    4

Browse[1]> X

Browse[1]> 

.
.
.

Playing around a little, seems to be variable capture, because

> sapply( seq(along=jjalist), function(i,xx,yy) 
+    {xx[[i]] %*% yy[[i]]}, xx=jjalist, yy=jjblist)

works as expected!  And indeed, from the source:

> sapply
function (X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE)  ...

but

> lapply
function (x, FUN, ...) 

so the argument to my FUN was captured here?

And indeed, after redefing:

lapply <- 
function (X, FUN, ...) 
{
            if (is.character(FUN)) 
                    FUN <- get(FUN, mode = "function")
            if (mode(FUN) != "function") 
                    stop(paste("\"", FUN, "\" is not a function", 
                         sep = " "))
            if (!is.list(X)) 
                    X <- as.list(X)
            rval <- vector("list", length(X))
            for (i in seq(along = X)) rval[i] <- list(FUN(X[[i]], ...))
            # keep `names' !
            names(rval) <- names(X)
            return(rval)
}
 everything works out nice.  

 [The same change should be made in tapply, while apply is good.]

I don't know why the 'make' is failing, as it seems to give no clue. I have

[short summary: sapply() calls lapply() which has its first argument
 called "x" matching the "x=jjalist" via "..." and things go crazy]

Yup. The *apply() functions should be consistent in the argument
naming for this reason. Of course, that doesn't guard against people
using X as an argument name in their functions, but it'll be a bit
more obvious what goes wrong. Fixed for 0.63.

There's a conspicuous lack of X11 libraries in that command, perhaps
configure couldn't find them (or you never installed them)?

Thank you, Jim.
seq(.) did contain much better tests in some cases, but I've overlooked
that one.

Here is the patch to be applied in   
R-0.62.4/src/library/base/R/ :

Hi
Is there a way to call R-Functions from C directly ? Is there an API

Any comments are welcome.
Thanks

Yes. The call_R mechanism (also known as call_S for compatibility).

Probably, the quickest way to see how it works is to look at the
demos/dynload example.

Thanks to Vin Everett and David Clayton <david.clayton at mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>,
an RPM package of R-0.62.4 for Red Hat Linux/SPARC 5.1 is now available
on CRAN. This means that RPMs are available for all three platforms
(Intel, Alpha, SPARC) currently supported by Red Hat.
