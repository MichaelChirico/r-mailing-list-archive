Subject: [R] Voice coding R?
Message-ID: <94c8e86c-bb84-4526-afe9-db719128cc24@gmail.com>

Is anyone using voice coding to work with R?? I need to give my hands a 
rest and would like to hear anyone's experience.

I'm currently using Rstudio but could change IDE if necessary. I'd 
strongly prefer tools that work under Linux.

More specifically, Serenade seems like a possible solution.? It does not 
support Rstudio directly but does support VS Code, which is supposed to 
support R.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks

I don't have any experience with this personally. I asked ChatGPT5.2.
Here is its answer, FWIW.

=============================================================

For Linux with full voice control (hands-free editing, navigation, and
coding) the landscape today is mostly powered by voice-control systems
that work across editors/IDEs, rather than an IDE that natively
supports voice as the primary input method. Here are the best options
you can realistically use:

________________________________

?? 1) Talon Voice (hands-free control + voice coding)

What it is:
A full voice-control system that lets you dictate text, control the
OS, edit code, navigate your editor/IDE, and issue complex commands by
voice. It works on Linux alongside tools like VS Code or RStudio.

Highlights

Voice control + dictation + custom commands.

Programmable and scriptable using Talon ?.talon? scripts.

With community command sets (e.g., knausj_talon), you get extensive
code-oriented voice commands and symbol insertion tricks.

Works on Linux (X11).

How it integrates:

VS Code / RStudio / terminal / browsers ? you control them via voice,
not by typing.

You can say things like ?insert parentheses?, ?select next word?, ?go
to line 42?, ?copy that?, etc. (command sophistication depends on your
voice command set).

? Talon is the gold standard for hands-free coding on Linux but comes
with a learning curve and requires installing Talon + a command set.

________________________________

? 2) Serenade (voice-to-code assistant)

What it is:
A voice-coding assistant that runs side-by-side with your editor
(e.g., VS Code) and lets you speak commands like ?create function
called foo? or ?insert for loop?. Serenade is available for Linux.

Highlights

Designed for programming languages, including code structures.

Uses either cloud or local speech recognition (configurable).

Works with VS Code and other editors via plugin.

?? Not as comprehensive for system-wide control as Talon, but more
focused on generating code snippets by voice.

My non-core vote is to discard this suggestion. 

FWIW R-Core doesn't pay much attention to this volunteer helpers list anyway... I suggest to OP that you spend a little more time with the official documentation before suggesting significant changes.

R-Core does. Several R-Core members are reading this list carefully.

install.packages() installs from CRAN and BioC standard repositories by 
default and allows for more CRAN-style repositories optionally.
If other kinds of repositories are requested, one can easily provide 
code in add on packages such as the pak package which already happened 
for the mentioned problem below, apparently.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Subject: [R] Split apply combine in data.table
Message-ID: <DM3PPF9A5B544E03A627A9171F34ED96B14FA98A@DM3PPF9A5B544E0.NAMP223.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>


In this code, I want to create and store an interpolation function for
each date.  It seems that data.table saves the same interpolation
function (for the last date) for all three dates.  How can this problem
be fixed?

Thanks,
Naresh

mydt <- list(data.table(date = as.IDate("2025-01-01"), x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(3, 4, 5)), data.table(date = as.IDate("2025-01-15"), x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(9, 8, 7)), data.table(date = as.IDate("2025-01-31"), x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(10, 12, 9)))
mydt <- rbindlist(mydt)
myapprox <- mydt[, list(yfunc = list(approxfun(x, y, rule = 2))), by =
list(date)]
testdt <- data.table(date = as.IDate(c("2025-01-01", "2025-01-15",
"2025-01-31")), x = 2)
testdt <- merge(testdt, myapprox, by = "date")
testdt[, let(yapprox = yfunc[[1]](x)), by = .I]
testdt <- merge(testdt, mydt, by = c("date", "x"))
testdt
Key: <date, x>
       date     x         yfunc yapprox     y
     <IDat> <num>        <list>   <num> <num>
1: 2025-01-01     2 <function[1]>      12     4
2: 2025-01-15     2 <function[1]>      12     8
3: 2025-01-31     2 <function[1]>      12    12

Using split function, it is possible to get the desired result.
mydtsplit <- split(mydt, f = mydt$date)
splitapprox <- lapply(mydtsplit, function(dt) dt[, approxfun(x, y,
rule = 2)])
newdt <- data.table(date = as.IDate(c("2025-01-01", "2025-01-15",
"2025-01-31")), x = 2)
newdt[, let(yfunc = splitapprox[as.character(date)]), by = .I]
newdt[, let(yapprox = yfunc[[1]](x)), by = .I]
newdt <- merge(newdt, mydt, by = c("date", "x"))
newdt
Key: <date, x>
       date     x         yfunc yapprox     y
     <IDat> <num>        <list>   <num> <num>
1: 2025-01-01     2 <function[1]>       4     4
2: 2025-01-15     2 <function[1]>       8     8
3: 2025-01-31     2 <function[1]>      12    12

Yann,
For those of us who are not as knowledable about the inner workings of R may I request that you give us more information:
(1) What is the problem with the current version of install.packages?
(2) What do you want install.packages to do that it currently does not do?
Thank you,
John

P.S. I looked at your Bluesky post, but it did not answer my quesitons.

The grouping operations in data.table reuse the same objects 'x', 'y'
with different contents when evaluating the expression for different
groups. As a result, the same objects end up being captured by
approxfun() for different groups:

myapprox$yfunc |> sapply(\(.) environment(.)$x |> address()) |> unique()
# [1] "0x562038fdbd88" # <-- only one address instead of three

Ideally, data.table should notice that its internal object is captured
instead of blindly reusing it for the next group, but it doesn't
currently do that. As a workaround, you can copy the otherwise-shared
objects explicitly:

myapprox <- mydt[, 
 .(yfunc = .(approxfun(copy(x), copy(y), rule = 2))),
 by = .(date)
]
myapprox$yfunc |> sapply(\(.) environment(.)$x |> address()) |> unique()
# [1] "0x562039b93238" "0x562039b92d38" "0x562039b92888"

Dear Mr. Wagman,

About 10 years ago I experienced some real difficulties with my hands. At that time, I tried to use my computer, including coding, by means of voice commands, but it didn't work well for me. It is possible that voice-control software have improved since that time, I cannot know.

My computer runs on Windows, not on Linux, so I am not sure whether the following suggestions would work on Linux.

Years ago, there were two resources that helped me quite a lot to decrease the use of my hands:

1. I found that the single most aggressive movement to my hands was the mouse click. So, I started to use the mouse only for positioning the cursor on the screen, but the "click" was performed by means of a foot switch (a pedal). This, below, is the one that I have used for many years, USA made, really sturdy, advertised as Windows and Mac OS compatible, sold in USB versions with either 1, 2 or 3 pedals, each pedal can be programmed to act as we wish:

[At the manufacturer] Savant Elite2 Dual Pedal
https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/savant-elite2-dual-pedal/

[At Amazon] Kinesis Savant Elite2 Programmable USB Foot Switch with 1, 2 or 3 Pedals
https://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Savant-Elite2-Programmable-FP20A/dp/B00QYRTTHI

2. To write, I have used (much less now, but very often at the peak of my hand impairment) the software Dasher, a tree-like way of writing any character on the screen, whether letters, numbers or punctuation characters. This was originally developed by Prof. David MacKay at Cambridge University in the UK, and is a free software. It has a learning curve, but it does work. It allows us to write without any mouse click, just by continuously positioning the cursor on the screen.

The last working version of Dasher is Dasher 5.0 beta, at the address below (on that page, it is said that Linux users must compile from source code):

https://github.com/dasher-project/dasher/releases

A version 6 of Dasher seems to be under development, but I think it actually has not been released yet.

On YouTube, you can get a feeling about how Dasher works. The first video is a one-hour-long 2007 Google Tech Talk by Prof. MacKay himself, explaining the concepts behind Dasher. The other two videos are well shorter, just demonstrations of the software.

Dasher: information-efficient text entry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie9Se7FneXE

Ada Majorek Introduction - CSUN Dasher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsSrClBwPM

Dasher alternative input software - review and how to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z7fr4pZhmQ

Please note:

(1) At least on Windows, Dasher can send its output (the written text) directly to any other active window, so you could write directly to your text editor, word processor or web browser.

(2) You will notice in the videos that, as the writing progresses, whole words appear on the Dasher screen, which can very much facilitate the writing of text. Dasher uses a background file of saved text (anything, like pieces of newspaper news, etc.), and we can add our own "dictionaries" to that backgroud file, anything we wish, anything that seems to be frequently used, like our own name or home address. In my case, I have added to that background file the most common R functions, a lot of them, like log, sqrt, data.frame, read.table, glm, and so on, and also functions used by some R packages, and other pieces of R code frequently used; this really makes it easier the writing of some R code.

(3) Dasher allows one to write in many different languages, not only English, as there exist background files (each with the proper "dictionary") in really many languages. In the Dasher settings, we can define which will be the background file of our choice.

I hope this will be of interest to you.

Best regards,

Paulo Barata

Good comments, Paulo.

I had serious hand and wrist problems years ago. I moved to supporting 
my arms on the table and going to a touch pad. Many of my problems were 
solved. I then moved to working on my neck and back problems by standing 
and speaking to capture my audio.

I then reviewed my audio and took notes of coding that mattered. I 
separated thinking from typing at the same time. The result has been 
increased physical health and?increased typing productivity.

Your mileage may vary.

Message-ID: <CAK4zTkbKLOpw3jvA_5S5JZxxkznNRVSpsZe4utu13=rG9wxXLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R Users,

I am looking for a roadmap to learn advanced functional programming in R.

I have already read *Functional Programming* by Thomas Mailund, and I have
been studying base R functions to understand how they are written and to
learn from their design. I have analyzed and rewritten dozens of base R
functions, and this process has been very instructive. However, I still
find it difficult to write more complex and robust functions on my own.

I would be very grateful for any advice you might have ? whether in the
form of recommended books, learning strategies, advanced resources, or
suggestions for progressing toward more advanced functional programming
skills in R. Additionally, I was wondering if there are any official
workshops, teaching sessions, or training initiatives focused on advanced
functional programming within the R ecosystem.

Kind regards.

Which part of functional programming in R do you find hard to understand?
Thomas Mailund's book has a lot of focus on R4 but functional
programming is so much more.

Have you looked at the purrr-packages and the family of apply-functions ?
If you want to make your own packages I suggest you read about vctrs:
https://vctrs.r-lib.org/

But it sounds like you already have read a lot of materiale including
source code so maybe you should not focus on reading.
I suggest that you instead just start writing a lot of code yourself.

And once every month look at your old code and improve it.

Maybe solve some of the many fun problems at https://adventofcode.com/

You can also learn a lot by trying to solve issues with existing
packages. Just find the source on github and
look at the issues eg. https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues

Martin

Saad,

To add a bit to the previous excellent advice,...

I think your query may be too vague to elicit helpful responses. A better
strategy might be to give a few **simple** examples of the sorts of
problems that demonstrate your concerns and your code for how you
approached them and reasons why you think these approaches need
improvement. To maximize your chance of useful responses, keep your code
snippets **short** (less than a dozen lines, say). For must of us, our eyes
glaze over when confronted with pages of code that we are supposed to
analyze and diagnose.

Cheers,
Bert

If you're solely focused on functional programming, try Structure and
Implementation of Computer Programs [1] or How to Design Programs [2],
but be ready to learn some theory and an unfamiliar language (Scheme).
For purely functional programming, you can try learning OCaml or
Haskell, but it's not a task for the faint of heart. Once you're done,
you'll be saying things like "a monad is just a monoid in the category
of endofunctors" and not understanding why people are giving you
strange looks in return.

If you'd like to make your programs more complex and robust, you need
to study software architecture. The Architecture of Open Source
Applications [3] is a free resource on the topic. Clean Architecture by
Robert C. Martin is a more fundamental book, very much worth obtaining.

As for learning software development in R... R is an environment where
you can interact with data; it only moonlights as a programming
language when you develop packages in it. To this end you can read
Extending R by John M. Chambers, Writing R Extensions
(RShowDoc("R-exts")) and many other free resources on the Web.

Finally, Functional Programming by Thomas Mailund predates the native R
pipe (|>) and the currently experimental tail call support (Tailcall(),
Exec()), so it's probably worth spending some time to learn the new
tools as well.

If you want to learn cdunctional programming, you?ve been given some
wxcellent advice.  R is not the best place for that.  If you want to become
excellent at R programming,  functional programming is one tool in the box.

FP has a few key ideas.  Working with immutable data is one.  Functions as
values is one.  And composition is a very important one. Designing
computations so that they are built out of reusable pieces that can be
combined using a handful of combinators.

A lot of R code, some of it extremely useful, has been written by people
who ae expert statisticians but poor programmers.  A lot of useful R
packages have been designed by people who weren?t thinking in terms of
making reusable pieces that could be easily combined.  Functions with
oodles of optional keyword parameters.  Interfaces with obvious gaps.

So don?t just think about rewriting code.  Think about redesigning whole
interfaces.

Others have told you how to learn functional programming.  I'm just 
writing to say I suspect you may not have used the jargon correctly: 
"functional programming" is a particular style of programming, and I 
suspect you may just want to know about programming in R (which involves 
writing functions, but that doesn't make it "functional programming").

Whether or not that's the case, I hope you follow Bert's advice, and 
show us more concrete examples of what you are really asking.  Without 
those it'll just be by luck if any of the responses are helpful.
