Subject: [R] Installing ncurses3 for R in Linux

A few weeks ago I installed ncurses3 and R for Linux (Red Hat 5.2). Since then I
messed up the boot sequence when I installed OS/2's Boot Manager (added some
partitions and could not boot from the boot floppy - by the time I figured out
what I should have done to boot from Boot Manager I had re-installed Linux). I
have Boot Manager booting Linux and OS/2 now but cannot re-install R in Linux.
When I originally installed ncurses3 I had gotten some error messages about
ncurses-4. something already installed but somehow I had managed to install
ncurses3and then R and it worked. Now I cannot get ncures3 re-installed even
though I'm using the same binary (I had saved everything to tape before screwing
up Linus). I've checked the RPM's and everything is OK. If I don't use --force I
get an error message saying ncurses-4 something is already installed. If I use -U
--force there are no error messages but ncurses3 is not installed and R won't
install. -i --force doesn't seem to work either.

Who's bright idea was it to link R and ncurses3?!  Does anyone have an idea why I
can't re-install ncurses3? Previoiusly I had seemed to have both ncurses and
ncurses3 installed. It shouldn't be this hard. I thought I understood how to use
the rpm command.

`Whose', perhaps?

Nobody AFAIK. My guess is that you are trying to use a binary distribution
of R, and the particular one you have uses ncurses3 (I seem to recall a
repsonse here from Martyn Plummer about it).  On Linux we recommend that
you compile from source: it is very easy (all of ten minutes on RH5.2 on a
PII-300) and will make optimal use of your system. Just one caveat to that:
ensure that you have egcs-g77 installed.

...or f2c but *not* fort77 for that matter.

The thing with ncurses3 is that that is what shipped in RH5.0, so for
a single binary to work for all RH5.x, one can link against that
one, which is what Martyn does. 

To run the binaries, I think it's sufficient to 

rpm -i /path/to/it/ncurses3-1.9.9e-7.i386.rpm 

on a RH5.2 system. (Perhaps include a --force)

Peter,

I've done

rpm -i --force etc.

It gives an error and says that ncurses (not ncurses3) with a version number
like 4.1.2 (I'm away from the machine and working from memory) is already
installed. I've tried -U --force with the same result. I had a similar result
the previous time (before I ended up re-installing RH5.2) but somehow ncurses3
was installed (along with ncurses). When I reinstalled RH5.2 I chose the same
options but obviously something is different.

Would it be safe to remove ncurses and install just ncurses3?

What about re-installing R and ncurses3 from the backup tape? Would that cause
some sort of problem with rpm's database of installed packages?

Before I would be able to compile R I would have to get the c compiler installed
and I'm very short on disk space at the moment.

As to the previous message (not from Peter) about "Who's" instead of "Whose",
let me say I see many more typo's and I don't comment on them. I usually re-read
my messages before sending but it was 1 o'clock in the morning.

Subject: [R] legend()
Message-ID: <372AF17C.DB3B847A@ozemail.com.au>

Jon,

It's fairly easy to get empty boxes and only some lines, e.g.

> legend(6,4,legend = c("al", "ben", "chris", "dave"),lty = c(1, 2, 3,
-1),
+ fill = c("white","white","white", "gray"))

If you really want to get box or line only, try replacing line 133 in
the function 'legend' with the following:

        for (boxcount in 1:length(xt)) {
            if (is.numeric(fill[boxcount]))
                dobox <- !is.na(fill[boxcount])
            if (is.character(fill[boxcount]))
                dobox <- nchar(fill[boxcount])
            if (dobox)
                rect2(xt[boxcount], yt[boxcount] + ybox/2, dx = xbox,
                  dy = ybox/2, col = fill[boxcount])
        }

Not very elegant, but it does the job.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.04.9905010827540.17724-100000@liberty.ddns.org>

ncurses3 is already on a 5.2 system in the 486 libs directory ( or
something like that). I just did a symlink from it to /usr/lib and
installed R with the --nodeps option (the RPM database does not know it is
installed). Once I tried to run R, I got another library error and had to
make another link, which I dont remember and all works fine now.

The option Peter needed for ncurses is --nodeps and --force I think, but I
didnt want to try it and have it remove something I needed, so I got it to
work using the symlinks to the actual files

May not be the right way, but it did work for me.

Neither

nor

    tar -zxvf R-0.64.0.tgz

would work due to an "Unexpected end of file" error, which seems to
occur after the 'fourier.c' file.  I have previously had no problem with
such files from CRAN.  Anyone else had this problem?  Or even better,
found a solution?  Thanks.

Hi again !

Thanks for the info on updating the config.site file which I 
have done. I have also added -lm in the Makeconf manually
because this is needed explicitly for DEC cc.

However, there are still a few problems when linking some
of the files as you can see from the enclosed log.

I think that you can safely ignore these warnings. When you link the
shared libraries using "library" or "dyn.load" the symbols will be
resolved.  It's really just the DEC linker being a bit over helpful.

I think you have a working R.  Try it out ...

Yes, btw,
one recommended way to ``try it out''  apart from the real first

    R
    demo(graphics)

is to run

   make check	(from the same place where you ran "make").

If it fails, please send the relevant info to  R-bugs (not R-help)!

This implicitly even provides a small timing benchmark of how fast R run's
on your machine:

   grep '^Time elapsed:' tests/Examples/*-Ex.Rout

Message-ID: <372D768B.DE3BC669@iarc.fr>

Dear Richard,

I am sorry that you are having problems with my R rpms. As explained
by Peter (and as stated in the README file) I link the R binary
against libncurses.so.3.0 in order to provide compatibility across all
5.x releases, since Red Hat changed from ncurses 3 to 4 between release
5.0 and 5.1 (but provide the ncurses3 package for backward compatibility).
The "bright idea" was to provide maximum utility to Red Hat users.

The bottom line is that RPMS are provided as an extra service for Red Hat
users to make life a little easier.  If they don't make life easier then
you should install from the source, which is not hard, just slower.

Richard A. Bilonick wrote:

Never use the --force flag. Forcing an rpm installation is the road to hell.
I take the attitude that I must work with the rpm database, not against it. If
I overrule it, I should not be surprised if it is no longer useful to me.

I have managed to get though the libjpeg mess on RedHat 5.1, two incompatible
versions of the gtk+ library and all the rpms released during the development
stage of GNOME without using force, so it is possible.

You should never get this error message: ncurses and ncurses3 are different
packages which provide different libraries and other files. Most likely your
rpm database is corrupt.  Another (extremely unlikely) possibility is
that your ncurses3 rpm has the wrong name and is really ncurses, although how
this could happen I don't know.
 
> Would it be safe to remove ncurses and install just ncurses3?

No. Most packages on RedHat 5.2 require ncurses 4.

Yes it would.

This may be the key to your problem.  Have you ever filled up the partition
which contains the rpm database? If rpm tried to write to the rpm database
when the disk was full, you may have a corrupt database.

My suggested strategy
1) Check that your ncurses3 rpm is really ncurses3 
   rpm -qi /path.to.it/ncurses3-*.rpm
1) rpm -e ncurses3
2) rpm --verify ncurses
   rpm --verify rpm
   Reinstall if you find missing or corrupt files. Do this with any other
   packages you installed recently.
3) rpm --rebuilddb
4) rpm -Uvh /path.to.it/ncurses3*.rpm
5) rpm -Uvh /path.to.it/R-base-0.64.0-1.i386.rpm

This is as much help as I can give you.
Good luck.
M.

I was indeed referring to "Geldenhuys being on W95."  I have been using
Tcl/Tk/Expect on Solaris, a variant of Unix, for several years now.

The poor wording of my statement above confused several people.  One
of the risks of non-verbal, non-interactive discussions.  I should
have said:

   Unfortunately for Geldenhuys and others running on Win95, expect
   runs only on Unix and WinNT, as far as I know.  My platform is
   Sparc/Solaris, so I'm able to use Tcl/Tk/Expect as a GUI front-end
   to R.

Subject: [R] bug

This is not a bug but a documented feature. If I do that in source, even
in Linux I do not get output from the summary call. Why? Because
you did not print it. Inside a function (and source is a 
function) autoprinting is turned off. You need to print
explicitly.  The function of summary() is to compute a summary,

Subject: [R] Pre-release of R-0.64.1 for Windows
Message-ID: <19990504081308.A1389@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

A pre-release of R-0.64.1 for Windows is available at 
CRAN/bin/windows/windows-NT/pre-0.64.1.
Since there are a lot of Windows specific changes (see below for a list), 
we hope that many Windows users of R will test this version and make comments. 

REMARK: I am posting this message on r-help hoping to reach a larger number
of Windows users. But, please, replay or directly to Brian D. Ripley 
(ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk) and me (guido at stat.unipd.it) or to r-devel.


CHANGES:
~~~~~~~~

An installer (rwinst.exe).

There is a choice of interface for Rgui:

o  SDI, single document interface. This is like the previous version,
   with separate windows for the console, graphics and pager(s).

o  MDI, multiple document interface.  Here the console, graphics and
   pagers are subwindows of one main `frame' window.

You can set your preference (and details of the MDI) in the Rconsole
file: this can also be overriden on the command line by --mdi or
--sdi.

If you use multiple files in a single SDI pager, the (row) positions
are remembered and re-used when you switch views in the pager.

For MDI pagers, the pager size is chosen by the system, and only
multiple pagers are supported.

When pagers are re-sized the strategy is now to keep the middle line
in the middle.

The option `setwidthonresize' in Rconsole automatically generates an
internal call to options("width") if you resize the console and change
its width.  This is the default, but we suggest you do not resize
while R is outputting.

The console, pagers and graphics devices now have right-click popup
menus, and you can paste from a pager to the console directly.

There is a new console menu item to show a file in a pager. This is
intended to allow lines to be selected in an script file displayed in 
a pager and submitted to the R engine.

`Busy' cursors are used where appropriate: a cross-hair cursor is
used on a graphics device to indicator that locator() (or identify())
is in use.

The file HOME\.Renviron is now read. This can contain environment
variables in NAME=value form, one per line. This is useful for setting
R_VSIZE, R_NSIZE, RLIBS and R_PAPERSIZE, for example.

You can now paste in more to the console: the limit (which was 2048
chars) is now that of the clipboard. Pasting can take place whilst
the console is busy.

The command `make pkgcheck-pkgname' will do the equivalent of `R CMD
check', that is run all the examples in the help pages for that package.

unlink can now handle wildcards and a vector argument of length more than
one.

R for Windows source is included in the main R distribution.

Subject: [R] contour and persp help please
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990504114737.8044A-100000@cbe207.gcal.ac.uk>

I have data saved in files on disk in following format
x	y	z
------------------
1	1	1
1	2	2
2	1	3
2	2	4

Normally I read the file into a data frame, but suppose I do it this way:
x<-seq(1,2)
y<-seq(1,2)
z<-seq(1,4)
data<-data.frame(x,y,z)
image(unique(data$x),unique(data$y),data$z, col=gray(0:19/19),
xlab="x", ylab="y")

I was helped at some point in the past on image().  However I can't figure
out how to make a contour plot or a persp plot. The help pages don't give
an example similar to mine.  Unfortunately Venables & Ripley don't discuss
contour or persp either (and maybe S-Plus differs from R anyway).

Thanks very much for any help!

OK I think I have it, sorry to have bothered you:

data<-data.frame(x,y,z)
x<-unique(data$x)

contour(x,y,z,xlab="x", ylab="y")
persp(x,y,z, col="gray")

Now I just have to look back in my notes to find out how to make this work
for 1600 z values--currently R runs out of memory.

Dear R-help,

How do you interpret the suffixes .L  and .Q  in the  summary? I tried
redefining overall$age_ordered(.... labels=c(...)), to no avail. When the
factors are unordered, the suffixes are the labels, but the fitted model is
different.

Any help is much appreciated.

For an ordered factor polynomial contrasts are used by default (this can
be set with options(contrasts=)).  Polynomial contrasts decompose the
effect of a variable into orthogonal linear, quadratic, cubic,... terms.
Based on the analysis above you might argue that all the quadratic terms
are relatively small and not statistically significant and that the linear
terms capture most of the variation.

You can see what the contrast matrix looks like by typing eg
R> contr.poly(3)
                .L         .Q
[1,] -7.071068e-01  0.4082483
[2,] -7.850462e-17 -0.8164966
[3,]  7.071068e-01  0.4082483

to get the polynomial contrasts for a three-level ordered factor.

For an unordered factor we use treatment contrasts by default (that is,
indicator variables for all but one level of the factor).  Any full rank
set of contrasts gives the same model, but the coefficients are different,
and allow you to answer different questions.  The choice of contrasts
depends on which questions you want to answer.

Message-ID: <199905041846.UAA06851@stat.math.ethz.ch>


I didn't see any mention of this in the material on CRAN.  The two S.h
files define R_problem_buf as a real symbol rather than simply
declaring its existence. As a result, a shared library that links two
or more files that include this will get duplicate symbol complaints.
Since it is not defined elsewhere in the code, someone has to define it.

A secondly thing is the documentation for .C() and company. It omits
what type list() objects have when passed to a C routine. It should
read void *, which is actually a SEXP * in this case. (I know, I
should be using .External but I am trying to keep the code for the
different S's and R's together until I have to abandon things.)

I am plotting data in logarithmic scale and I find that R (0.63.2 on
Linux) and Splus (Unix v3.4 & NT v4.5) behave differently. 

In R if I use the following I get the expected (correct) behaviour

   > plot(10^(1:5),8^(1:5),xaxt="n",yaxt="n",log="xy")
   > axis(1,at=10^(1:5))
   > axis(2,at=10^(1:4))

However in Splus I get errors forcing me to use log10 for at in axis.

   > plot(10^(1:5),8^(1:5),xaxt="n",yaxt="n",log="xy")
   > axis(1,at=10^(1:5))
   Line segments out of bounds X= 10 Y= 0.7585956
   > axis(2,at=10^(1:4))
   Line segments out of bounds X= 0.84 Y= 10

Which one is considered normal behaviour?

Thanks

For ordered factor the natural contrast coding would be to parametrize by
the succsessive differences between levels, which does not assume equal
spacing
of factor levels as does the polynomial contrasts (implicitly at least).

This requires the contr.cum, which could be:

contr.cum <- function (n, contrasts = TRUE) 
{
    if (is.numeric(n) && length(n) == 1) 
        levs <- 1:n
    else {
        levs <- n
        n <- length(n)
    }
    contr <- array(0, c(n, n), list(levs, levs))
    contr[col(contr) <= row(contr)] <- 1
    if (contrasts) {
        if (n < 2)

Why is this not part of the standard R distribution ?

What is `natural' is a matter of opinion, of course, and does not
facilitate reducing the number of dfs given to the factor.  If the levels
are known not to be equally spaced, and it is know how they are spaced then
I suggest you have rather more than an ordinal varaible, which is what
ordered factors are designed for. In that case, use poly on a set of scores
for the levels.

Well, there are lots of things we could add, but this one is 
precisely (as far as I can see) contr.sdif in the MASS library.

Hi

I've tried and tried and I presume it is very simple but .....

I want some varying titles for plots using greek symbols
eg using an expression like

for (true in c(0:5))
   plot(...,main = expression(paste(phi," = ",true,sigma)),...)

where phi and sigma are greek symbols.  Instead of \phi=2\sigma I get
\phi=true\sigma as true is taken as a text string - not a variable.

Any help much appreciated

Thanks

Problem is not in plot but in the fact that expression takes
everything inside literally: 

> expression(paste(phi," = ",true,sigma))
expression(paste(phi, " = ", true, sigma))

Try creative uses of substitute:

> substitute(expression(paste(phi, " = ", true, sigma)),list(true=5))
expression(paste(phi, " = ", 5, sigma))

and then

> plot(0,0,main=substitute(expression(paste(phi, " = ", true, 
+ sigma)),list(true=5)))

...which doesn't quite work, because the result is an object of mode
"call" (namely to the primitive function "expression"), not the result
of such a call (which is of mode "expression", although it prints
identically -- yes, this is confusing!). 

What does work is either to evaluate the call, yielding an object of
mode "expression":

> plot(0,0,main=eval(substitute(expression(paste(phi, " = ", true,
+ sigma)),list(true=5))))

...or to use the fact that an object of mode "call" is also allowed for
math graphics and dump the expression bit:

> plot(0,0,main=substitute(paste(phi, " = ", true, sigma),list(true=5)))

I read them into a data frame and do the plot.
data<-read.table("~/r/rt/data/unif/6cbcif2d.out",header=TRUE)
x<-unique(data$lag1)
y<-unique(data$lag2)
z<-matrix(data$cif2d,length(y),length(x))
image(x,y,z, col=gray(0:19/19),xlab="Lag 1 (s)", ylab="Lag 2 (s)")

Then I did:
> z

[1,]   17   16    8   11   12   10   13
[2,]   16   17   14    8   11   12   15
[3,]    8   14   17   14    7    3    1
[4,]   11    8   14   17    5    4    2
[5,]   12   11    7    5   17    5    6
[6,]   10   12    3    4    5   17    9
[7,]   13   15    1    2    6    9   17

I find this quite strange, since I expected to find numbers from the cif2d
column in the data table above. Is there something funny going on with
matrix()?

Thanks very much for any help.

I changed the NaNs to NAs and now it works.
There is such a thing as is.nan, so I thought NaNs were used OK by R.

Maybe this has been fixed in a more recent R version (I am using 63.0)

Hello everybody,

shame on me if I have overlooked something (CRAN, StatLib), but I think
I've searched carefully. Maybe it's just too obvious to see for me
(happens frequently).

Is a function available that extracts multiple comparison of means from
objects produced by "aov()" ? Sorry if the term is not correct, I
translated from german word by word ("Multiple Mittelwertvergeiche"). 

What I mean are procedures like the Student-Newman-Keuls test or Scheffe
test, that allow to test selected pairs of factor combinations after
applying an ANOVA to a set of data. 

I'm somewhat surprised that this seems not to be a topic of discussion
among R-users since great emphasis is put on these procedures in most
(german) textbooks on applied (bio)statistics.

Many thanks ...

translated from german word by word ("Multiple Mittelwertvergeiche"). 

What I mean are procedures like the Student-Newman-Keuls test or Scheffe
test, that allow to test selected pairs of factor combinations after
applying an ANOVA to a set of data. 

I'm somewhat surprised that this seems not to be a topic of discussion
among R-users since great emphasis is put on these procedures in most
(german) textbooks on applied (bio)statistics.

Many thanks ...

Subject: [R] image weirdness
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990506123621.10381A-100000@cbe207.gcal.ac.uk>

I am using R 63.0.
Now let's try this simple image plot.
Here is the data file:
============================
lag1 lag2 cif2d
1 1 11
1 2 12
1 3 13
2 1 21
2 2 22
2 3 23
3 1 31
3 2 32
3 3 33
====================

data<-read.table("~/r/rt/data/unif/junk.out",header=TRUE)
x<-unique(data$lag1)
y<-unique(data$lag2)
z<-matrix(data$cif2d,length(y),length(x))

At this point, see the z matrix:
> z
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   11   21   31
[2,]   12   22   32
[3,]   13   23   33

This is correct.

Now, the image plot should have cell values  in this layout:

y
3 	| 13	23	33
2	| 12	22	32
1	| 11	21	31
---------------------------
	1	2	3	x
But when I do:
image(x,y,z, col=gray(0:19/19),xlab="Lag 1 (s)", ylab="Lag 2 (s)")

The resulting plot has the values
31	32	33
21	22	23
11	12	13

In other words it seems image() has reversed the x and y values.

So I do:
image(y,x,z, col=gray(0:19/19),xlab="Lag 1 (s)", ylab="Lag 2 (s)")

And the plot is exactly the same!!
What is going on, and how to fix?  Thanks very much for any help.

(BTW, it seems that persp() works correctly in this example, assuming the 
x axis is the one in the front of the drawn cube, y is the axis going
into the page, and z is the height)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990506132235.10432A-100000@cbe207.gcal.ac.uk>

I think my problems are coused by a fundamental R incompatibility in how
matrices are stored and the usual way of specifying Cartesian coordinates.

When I do
data<-read.table("~/r/rt/data/unif/6cbcif2d.out",header=TRUE)
x<-unique(data$lag1)
y<-unique(data$lag2)
z<-matrix(data$cif2d,length(y),length(x))

This z matrix is printed apparently correctly from a Cartesian point of
view
> z
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   11   21   31
[2,]   12   22   32
[3,]   13   23   33

But if you look at the numbers on the top and side you see that the row
and column indexes have been reversed!  By that I mean in Cartesian system
you do (x,y) which is equiv to (col,row); matrix() prints the numbers
above in accord with (col,row) but they are actually stored as (row,col).

> z[2,1]
[1] 12
whereas I would expect 21.

If this is standard for you stats people that is too bad, in my opinion.
I always think in terms of x,y,z = col, row, height.

So I need to use:
z<-matrix(data$cif2d,length(y),length(x), byrow=TRUE)

How do you avoid getting mixed up when making an image plot of a matrix?

I like the way persp() is set up, which is NOT the way image() is set up.

It is somewhat standard. It probably comes from having to work with only
two-dimensional data structures, which makes it logical to have one
dimension indexing records and the other indexing variables.  Spatial data
would then be stored with columns x,y,d1,d2,d3 for multiple data fields
d1-d3. 

For data observed on a rectangular grid it might well be better to use a
3-d array with d1-d3 on slices of the array. But even for spatial data if
they are observed on some other grid (like the triangular equal area grids
used for some global-scale satellite data) or at irregular points it
doesn't help at all.

There may, on the other hand, be a good case for having image() work the
other way, though you could just do image(x,y,t(z)) to transpose the z
matrix.

This is standard not just for 'stats people', but also in Fortran, 
which by default assumes  numbers are read column-wise.
(In computer memory column-wise numbers are contiguous.)

In matrix algebra we always refer to the row of the matrix first
e.g., (x,y)-element refers to row-x-and-column-y element. 

So the mismatch between the matrix reading/printing/referencing
and the Cartesian plot as in image() is not unique of R. The
geometric mismatch is actually necessary so we can still refer
to the same (x,y) element in the matrix and in the plot.

x and y in image will only affect the axes, the image itself is 
determined by matrix z, i.e., you could do > image(z).
To fix? well, just remember rows of a matrix are image()'d 
column-wise.

Subject: [R] Model building ...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990505114841.9416A-100000@mercury.quantex>

Hi

Are there any functions that de-convolute data into a given number of
clusters, rather like the NPMLE GLIM macros from Murray Aitkin and Brian
Francis?  Basically I would like to code into R the same approach but
include the possiblility of some data being censored.  In principle the
formulae are the same (just replace the likelihood function) but I haven't
managed to get my head round the model building problems.

I am looking for an elegant way of doing the following:

Consider a model where the variables are partitioned into two groups -
call them fixed and random.  I have these as data frames - each can be a
mixture in principle of vectors and factors.  Then I want to fit:

Y~fixed+F:random

where Y is the response (possibly including the censoring indicator), F is
a factor.  The response, the factor F and the random and fixed data frames
are stacked N long for N mass points. F indexes the mass point. 

I have been trying to build up the model and use gnlr() except the
complexities are beating me at the moment.  Should I use a list or a model
frame?  Can anyone advise?

John

That's not released until tomorrow!  I guess you have the pre-release,
prerw0641, which is actually of 0.64.0.

What's that? The response ought to be a factor, according to the docs:

 formula: A formula of the form `groups ~ x1 + x2 + ...{}'
          That is, the response is the grouping factor and
          the right hand side specifies the (non-factor)
          discriminators.

It is an R issue. Only logical, integer and real variables are allowed
in R model frames, for as the code says

    /* Sanity checks to ensure that the the answer can become */
    /* a data frame.  Be deeply suspicious here! */


But that is not the `right' way to do this in either. Use either

lda.out<-lda(sarich.na[,4:32], sarich.na[,3])

or

lda.out<-lda(somename ~ ., data=sarich.na[,3:32])

where somename is the name of column 3, and that had better be a factor.

I haven't delved deeply into R internals yet.  I just started experimenting
with it as I was learning SPlus in parallel.  So at the present time, even
though sarich.na[,3] *is* a factor but with alpha levels, are you saying
that R won't allow this?

Deeply suspicious of what?

>But that is not the `right' way to do this in either. Use either

Either?  Are you saying that the formulation above isn't correct in
*either* R or SPlus?  It works fine in SPlus (and sarich.na[,3] is coded as
a factor with levels "AINU", "BUSHMAN", etc...).  But, SPlus also allows
sarich.na[,3] to be on the left side even if it isn't an explicit factor.
Even if it is coded only as a character variable, SPlus allows it, lda
calculates the results, and gives the correct answers.  Presumably if this
isn't the "correct" approach, SPlus or lda is coercing the character
variable to a factor.  This also works in aov and other functions that take
a formula.

>lda.out<-lda(sarich.na[,4:32], sarich.na[,3])

This works fine in Splus, not in R, at least not with this data set.

Also works in Splus, but not in R.

However, *this* works:

attach(sarich.na)
lda.out<-lda(as.factor(populati)~., data=sarich.na[,4:32])

This puzzles me.  The variable "populati" *is* a factor already.  Why would
I have to coerce a factor to a factor to get this to run?  But, following
the logic above, the next variant ought to work, but it doesn't.


lda.out<-lda(sarich.na[,4:32], as.factor(sarich.na[,3])

This emits an error message telling me I can't have negative length
subscripts, an error message that leaves me without a clue at the moment.

It will allow factors: they get coerced to integers. I think from the
evidence later that sarich.na[,3] is not a factor, even if it looks like
one.

Of things that look like factors? (I don't know, I didn't write this.)

I am saying that it is legal in S-PLUS but poor style, and likely to cause
methods (e.g. for prediction) to fail. In neither dialect is it what the
designers intended.

Yes, S-PLUS coerces character vars in model frames to factor, and I
believe R does not allow them. Here is a simple experiment.

R:

> data(iris)
> names(iris)
[1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"     
species <- as.character(iris$Species)

> lda(species ~ . - Species, data=iris)
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras,
extranames,  : invalid variable type

> lda(Species ~ ., data=iris)
> lda(as.matrix(iris[, 1:4]), species)

works fine. It looks like R is having problems with data frames here
that I will have to look into. In R a data frame is not a matrix, and
much less coercion gets done.

I believe that is a very old comment (probably by Ross)... I think
that the point is that there are cases that are easily overlooked,
such as the fact that a "column" of a data frame can actually be a
matrix. 

The important thing that gets ruled out is string vectors (whether
or not that is a good idea...), which is probably exactly what Marc F.
has where he thinks he has a factor.

No actually I *had* a factor.

This is why I was perplexed by the behavior after Brian suggested the

Strange things may happen if the "factor" class gets set by unorthodox
means. E.g.:

> d<-letters[1:3]
> class(d)<-"factor"
> d
NULL
Levels:   
> unclass(d)
[1] "a" "b" "c"
> is.factor(d)   
[1] TRUE
> factor(d)
Error: invalid labels argument in "factor"

Another possibility is that it is the indexing in itself that is
confusing the model formula parsing code. Perhaps it may work to put
in I(sarich.na[,3])?

This file was dumped directly from S-Plus.  This is what I get if I use the
levels() function from within R.  Nothing untoward there that I can see.

levels(sarich.na[,3])

Subject: [R] Solaris/Linux difference
Message-ID: <199905071209.OAA27834@ac5.sci.kun.nl>

Hi all,

I have a library in which some BLAS fortran files are compiled. Running it
on Linux (R 0.63.0) works fine, but if I run the same library on Solaris (R
0.63.2) I get the error

ld.so.1: /vol/acfiles1/rwehrens/R-0.63.2/bin/R.binary: fatal: relocation
error: file /vol/acfiles1/rwehrens/R-0.63.2/library/mclust/libs/mclust.so:
symbol __i_dnnt: referenced symbol not found


I grepped both R sources and library sources, but nowhere is something like
"i_dnnt" present. However:

Solaris:
> is.loaded(symbol.C("i_dnnt"))
[1] FALSE

Linux:
> is.loaded(symbol.C("i_dnnt"))
[1] TRUE

Any idea what could be wrong here? I use the standard settings in building
R; that is on Linux compilation is done using gcc and f2c and
Solaris uses cc and f77.

When I try to install R-0.64.0 on my SUN (

I get after "./configure --disable-readline" and "gmake" the following

};


Is there anything I can do to get around this?

Subject: [R] using text() to write into left margin
Message-ID: <NABBLIOAJNIMENKGLDDGCEHACMAA.twestley@buffalo.veridian.com>

In version 0.63.0 for Win95, I can use text() to
write into the left margin (to the left of the axis)
as follows:

> plot(0:10,0:10,pch="+")
> text(c(1,0.5,0,-0.5,-1),1,"O")

I see 5 "O" symbols at the expected position, two of
which are left of the left axis.

However, in version 0.64.0 for Solaris 2.5.1 on a
Sparc/Ultra2, I only see three "O" symbols.  Those
that are to the left of the axis do not appear.

Is this an expected result?

I am using text() instead of mtext() because I want
the labels to appear at Y co-ordinate positions as
normal text, not rotated 90 deg.  These are text
labels rather than numbers, so I'm suppressing the
left axis and using text() to write the labels.

Even if I can get text() to work as I've come to
expect on the PC, maybe there's a better way I've
missed?

This is due differences in clipping strategies.  If possible, graphics
primitives are supposed to clip their items to the plot window, but
hardware (and sofware) differs in its ability to do this.  If you want to
turn the clipping off use the "xpd = TRUE" option.

You could try using the "srt" (string rotation) and "adj" (text
adjustment) options to mtext.  Using
	 mtext(..., srt = 0, adj = 1)
will produce unrotated strings with the text right adjusted.

These options have probably not been exercised as much as some
of the others and may have the odd bug.  If you find any, we'll
fix them.

Subject: [R] format backslash behaviour
Message-ID: <199905100528.PAA08216@dylan.tip.CSIRO.AU>


The following seems weird:

> format("\pm2")
[1] "pm2"

> format("\\pm2")
[1] "\\\\pm2"
> 

i.e. it seems impossible to set up a x so that "format(x)" returns 
"\\pm2", and in turn "cat(format(x))" prints "\pm2".  ("\pm" is latex for 
"plus/minus").

R is version 0.64 for win95.

I want to add a row of headings to a matrix of character objects, then 
use "format" on each column to make the matrix less ragged (not 
essential), and cat the result for use as a latex table.

Splus 3.4 does the same, and I currently regard compatibility with Splus 
as a very convenient feature, so I suppose it is not a bug.

I would appreciate any explanations for the behaviour, and any hints 
about neat workarounds.

Thanks, and thanks for R

No such version, that I know of. I assume you have 0.64.0 for
Windows (rw0640)

If M is your matrix,

M[] <- gsub("\\\\\\\\", "\\\\", M)
write(M, ncol=ncol(M), file="whatever")

does the trick for me. (That turns "\\\\pm2" into "\\pm2" that write
then prints as "\pm2". Beware: print prints it as "\\pm2".)

Hello out there,

there has recently been a posting of Uli Flenker with a question about
multiple comparisons etc. of means after anova, and I posted a similar
question earlier. So far, I haven't seen any replies on the list. It
would be nice if somebody could give me a hint whether the silence
meant "no", "don't know", "no interest", or simply "question
irrelevant or stupid". Especially the last would ideally be
supplemented by a short literature recommendation ;-)

Might be, that I'm overlooking something, but for non-mathematicians
it is sometimes a little bit hard to find your way through the R help
files, partly, because popular books or articles about statistics read
by, say, simple biologists, use a slightly different language (or
explain things a little bit superficially).

However, even if R is intended for more professional "users", I must
say that I learned a lot from and with R, and I think, it could be a
very valuable tool for "beginners" in statistics, too (much more than
click-and-believe-what-I-say packages used in some institutes I know).
The serious drawback of this for you is, that people like me ask silly
questions on R-help ...

Thank you for patience & sorry for wasting your time,
Ulf

Subject: [R] dotted contour line for negative values?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990510113625.353A-100000@cbe207.gcal.ac.uk>

I have a contour plot where the surface can take on positive and negative
values.  I would like to use solid contour lines for positive values and
dotted contour lines for negative values. I saw a plot like this produced
by S-Plus before.  Is there a way to do this with R? If not, can anyone
suggest a way to make interpretation of the contour plot easier? (Right
now, it is not clear if a set of "tree rings" in a plot indicate the
presence of a peak or a trough)

I am thinking that it might be possible by making one plot of the positive
contours with lty="solid", add=TRUE, then superimpose the negative
contours with lty="dotted". The snag is: how to get only the positive or
negative contours?

Thanks very much for any help.

  [ multiple comparisons question ]

  In my opinion a multiple comparisons test is certainly worth having.  I
think it's just that no-one has gotten around to coding one.  (I do know
as well that multiple comparisons tests are sometimes frowned on by "real"
statisticians as being on the slippery slope leading to fishing
expeditions.)

  I know one of the students around here looked in Zar's Biostatistics
book and coded up a multiple comparisons test for himself; if I get around
to it I will get it from him and post it.  The hardest part of the job,
the distribution of the test statistic for (? I forget which one: Tukey's
LSD ?), is already incorporated in R as qtukey() and ptukey().

On the contrary, I feel that they are very effective in *preventing*
people from going on fishing expeditions when they see how their
evidence vanishes in thin air as corrections are applied...

The problem in relation to programs like R is that the tests are
typically not very general. A good many of them really only work for
comparing means from a balanced design with equal replications per
factor level, with constant variance and (perhaps not all that
important) Normal error distribution.

Thus, they won't fit into lm() or any such general framework, which of
course shouldn't necessarily keep anyone from coding a special-purpose
function for the standard case including the 20-odd variations on the
multiple comparison issue. 

However, since I hardly ever see a "standard case" analysis (except
when teaching....), I'm not highly motivated to write a function for
it. 

Of generally applicable techniques, there really isn't much beyond
Bonferroni correction and elaborations of it. Thomas Lumley posted the
following a long time ago (perhaps we should include them in base?).
The Holm method is the one that makes most sense to me.

Here is code for three p-value based post hoc tests: bonferroni, holm, and
hochberg. Holm is better than Bonferroni under all circumtances. Hochberg
is more powerful than Holm, but under some slightly pathological
situations it can exceed the nominal Type I error rate.

I haven't looked at this code for a long time, but I think it works
correctly. Refeerences for the methods are in "Adjusted p-values for
simultaneous inference" by S. Paul Wright in Biometrics some time in
the early 90s (I'm in the wrong country at the moment so I don't have the
full reference).

Tukey's *H*SD (also known as the Studentised Range), LSD is Fishers
Least Significant Difference, i.e. uncorrected t tests, HSD for
"*Honestly* Signif. Diff."....

We don't seem to have the many-one t distribution ( max(X_k - X_1)/s,
X_1,...,X_n ~ indep. N(0,sigma), s^2 ~ sigma^2*chisq(df) ), though.
Anyone have an algorithm?

As the Debian package maintainer I'm apologize for not responding to
you earlier.  I was travelling last week and away from my e-mail.

The general way of using the .tex files created in the latex directory
for each package is to go to /usr/lib/R/doc/manual and run latex on
the file Reference.tex.  I see that it doesn't work with the current
Debian package.  I'll try to fix that when I upload the package for
R-0.64.1

That binary version of that package will be uploaded to the unstable
or potato distribution but the source version should be able to build
on a slink system.  Once I get the package generated I will send you
instructions on how to build it from the sources.

This can be done automatically from the source,  but with a binary
package of R (or if you have deleted the source) it looks like you
have to do it by hand.  The following procedure works for R 0.64.1.

If you look in $RHOME/doc/manual - assuming you have this - you will find
the relevant LaTeX files.  Copy these files to another directory where
you have write access and do something like this:

export RHOME=`R RHOME`
for pkg in base eda mva lqs modreg stepfun; do
   cat ${RHOME}/library/${pkg}/latex/*.tex > pkg-${pkg}.tex
done
latex Reference.tex
latex Reference.tex

Latex will complain about a missing Version.tex file.  Strictly speaking
(and we do like to speak strictly here) this is the "R Reference
Index". The "R Manual" is created with "latex Manual.tex". Again, the
file Version.tex is missing.

I hope this helps.

Adding the xpd option to text() works great.  Thanks.

Here is a small example.  The trick is to specify the levels
and to use the add= argument.

	x <- seq(-1, 1, length=21)
	f <- function(x,y) (x^2 + y^2) / 2 - 0.5
	z <- outer(x, x, f)
	contour(z, levels = seq(-0.5, -0.1, by = 0.1), lty = "dotted")
	contour(z, levels = 0, lty = "dashed", add = TRUE)
	contour(z, levels = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1), add = TRUE)

-------------------------

Many thanks.  In fact I'm trying (perhaps misguidedly) to keep programs 
interoperable with Splus 3.4, and have settled on the following "format":

formattex <- function(x){
# pads  character vector x for equal nchar of elements with leading spaces
# doesn't double backslashes (but interprets \12 etc)
        zl <- nchar(x)
        bl <- "                    "
        zs <- substring(bl, 1, max(zl) - zl)
        paste(zs, x, sep = "")
}

Leading padding also suit some numerical columns better than the 
trailing padding of "format()".

It would be nice to have some bonferroni-like correction in the base, 
in my opinion. It could be useful also for other purposes - matrix of 
correlation coefficients, for example.

Not answering the original question,
however
just adding a hint : 
Since R 0.64.x,  there's the very nice useful function

     filled.contour(.)	   {by Ross himself!}
     -----------------

Consider

   x <- seq(-1, 1, length=21)
   z <- outer(x, x, function(x,y) (x^2 + y^2)  - 1)

   filled.contour(z) ## for color output
# or
   filled.contour(z, color.palette = function(n)gray(1:n/n) ## for (gray) output

Also look at the beautiful

    example(filled.contour)

((which needs an

	x11(colortype = "pseudo")

 if you have just 8-bit colors as I do))

Is there a simple way of getting the legend in the margin as a row of text
with pch etc. instead of a column -
like
* - Case 1 (pch chars) - Case 2 etc.
as opposed to
* - Case 1
(pch chars) - Case 2 etc.
?

I have had a problem with stripplot. Documentation does say that method
="stack" is only appropriate for granular data, but I don't think that
means it should fall over.

> difference
 [1]  2.0  1.3  2.8 -2.6 -0.4 -0.4 -1.2 -1.4 -1.0  1.2 -2.6 -1.9
> stripplot(difference)
> stripplot(difference,method="jitter")
> stripplot(difference,method="stack")
Warning in y + (unlist(xo) - 1) * offset * csize : longer object length
        is not a multiple of shorter object length
Error: x and y lengths differ

Here is the code to check it.

difference<-c(2, 1.3, 2.8, -2.6, -0.4, -0.4, -1.2, -1.4, -1, 1.2, -2.6, -1.9)
stripplot(difference)
stripplot(difference,method="jitter")   
stripplot(difference,method="stack") 

I have had the same result on 0.63.2 for windows and 0.63.3 for Sun.

Subject: [R] R manual - S manual
Message-ID: <3739A492.68081853@omega.ien.it>

I just started working on R, and lacking a manual I saw that the advice
is to use som S or S-plus manual.
Where can I find it online?

P.S. I already downloaded and read "notes on S-plus" by Venables/Smith:
now I'd need something
deeper.


P.P.S. please, reply even by email to magni at omega.ien.it

the dataframe was a problem, I think it might be something to do with
internal representation of numbers:

Works!!!

The bit of code inside stripplot that is playing up is intended to
determine where there are repeated values, and create a sequence
numbering the values:
    f <- function(x) seq(length(x))
    for (i in 1:n) {
        x <- groups[[i]]
        y <- rep(i, length(x))
        if (method == 2) 
            y <- y + runif(length(y), -jitter, jitter)
        else if (method == 3) {
            xg <- split(x, factor(x))
            xo <- lapply(xg, f)
            x <- unlist(xg)
            y <- y + (unlist(xo) - 1) * offset * csize



Here is the data in the file (it is also attached):
supplier1       supplier2
3.8     1.8
3.5     2.2
4.1     1.3
2.5     5.1

3.2     4.2
3.7     2.5
2.8     5.4
2.7     4.6


And a copy of the necessary bits of code:
impurity.df<-read.table("impurities.dat",header=T)
supp.diff<-impurity.df$supplier1-impurity.df$supplier2
stripplot(supp.diff,method="stack")
supp.diff<-c(2, 1.3, 2.8, -2.6, -0.4, -0.4, -1.2, -1.4, -1, 1.2, -2.6,
-1.9)
stripplot(supp.diff,method="stack")

Subject: [R] Legend in the Margins of a plot
Message-ID: <373ACC0D.9C5D60D2@ozemail.com.au>

Partha,

If you mean the style of legend below or above the plot as often seen in
charting programs, this might be what you need.  You may have to set the
margins to get this to work - e.g.

>par(mar=c(7,4,4,2))

> plot(1:10,xlab="")
> legend.mar(legend=c("First","Second","Third"),lty=1:3,pch=1:3,col=1:3)

The function is as follows:

> legend.mar
function (side = 1, xpos, ypos, legend, lty, pch, col)
{
    if (!missing(legend)) {
        oldpar <- par("adj","xpd)
        par(adj = 0, xpd = T)
        legendwidth <- strwidth(legend)
        markwidth <- strwidth("MM")
        totalwidth <- sum(legendwidth) + 3 * markwidth * length(legend)
        if (missing(xpos)) {
            xlim <- par("usr")[1:2]
            xcenter <- (xlim[1] + xlim[2])/2
            xpos <- xcenter - totalwidth/2
        }
        if (missing(ypos)) {
            ylim <- par("usr")[3:4]
            yoffset <- (ylim[2] - ylim[1])/6
            if (side != 1)
                ypos <- ylim[2] + yoffset
            else ypos <- ylim[1] - yoffset
        }
        if (missing(col))
            col <- rep(1, length(legend))
        for (i in 1:length(legend)) {
            if (!missing(pch))
                points(xpos, ypos, type = "p", pch = pch[i],
                  col = col[i])
            if (!missing(lty))
                lines(c(xpos - markwidth, xpos), c(ypos, ypos),
                  type = "l", lty = lty[i], col = col[i])
            xpos <- xpos + markwidth
            text(xpos, ypos, legend[i])
            xpos <- xpos + legendwidth[i] + 2 * markwidth
        }
        par(oldpar)
    }
    else cat("Usage: legend.mar([side=1] [, xpos] [, ypos], legend [,
lty] [, pch] [, col=1])\n")
}


Bit rough, but I hope it helps.

This must be a version compatibility problem, I guess. Is there a
fix for that (short of compiling R)? Thanks in advance. FC.

That symbol is a holdover from bygone days when, by default, a program
run on Linux set up the floating point hardware in a
non-IEEE-compatible way.  With recent versions of the glibc that
routine no longer exists.

I don't think you will be able to install the prepackaged RPM file
easily.  You may want to try a compile from the sources instead.

Hum. The current logic is to use __setfpucw if it is there, but I
suspect it isn't actually doing anything useful on versions younger
than RedHat 4.2... Perhaps we should just dump it? Very probably,
Martyn could do that for the official .rpm version, right?

There might be a workaround involving the linking in of a dummy
__setfpucw, but it'll be major brain surgery compared to the simple
operation of a recompile.

If I may be so bold, I offer RPMs for R that will run under RH6 (if you
install the hdf5 data format as well).  These have been prepared for the
Swarm user community because we use the hdf5 data format along with R.
SO, if you want to try the RPM for R on a RH6 system, I have it.  In
order to use this, you will also need to install the hdf5 RPM that is
available in the same place.  TO find them, go here

http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/Swarm

and look in a subdirectory that has a name like RPMSforRH6-glibc2.1.

Good luck, these are for R0.64.0, and soon I'll upgrade to 0.64.1.

The current set of RPMs are for RedHat 5.x. You have RedHat 6.0.  I
can't guarantee binary compatibility across major releases of RedHat
Linux.

You might try installing  compat-glibc-5.2-2.0.7.1.i386.rpm
and anything else beginning with "compat-" to see if that helps,
but this is just a guess.

I will produce RPMs for RedHat 6.0 just as soon as I get hold of it,
but since it only started shipping on Monday, it is a bit early yet.

Message-ID: <OFDB5D1911.1495808D-ON85256771.005BE056@hgsi.com>


Jim,
Thanks for the code. That is what I meant when I talked about legends in
the margin. My situation was to put 4 plots on one page and then put the
legend at the bottom as they all shared the same legend. I finally used the
layout function with a fake 5th plot containing the legend.
PS: If anyone is using this code, please correct the minor typo on the 3rd
line of the function.

Partha,

If you mean the style of legend below or above the plot as often seen in
charting programs, this might be what you need.  You may have to set the
margins to get this to work - e.g.

>par(mar=c(7,4,4,2))
> plot(1:10,xlab="")
> legend.mar(legend=c("First","Second","Third"),lty=1:3,pch=1:3,col=1:3)
The function is as follows:

> legend.mar
function (side = 1, xpos, ypos, legend, lty, pch, col)
{
    if (!missing(legend)) {
        oldpar <- par("adj","xpd)
        par(adj = 0, xpd = T)
        legendwidth <- strwidth(legend)
        markwidth <- strwidth("MM")
        totalwidth <- sum(legendwidth) + 3 * markwidth * length(legend)
        if (missing(xpos)) {
            xlim <- par("usr")[1:2]
            xcenter <- (xlim[1] + xlim[2])/2
            xpos <- xcenter - totalwidth/2
        }
        if (missing(ypos)) {
            ylim <- par("usr")[3:4]
            yoffset <- (ylim[2] - ylim[1])/6
            if (side != 1)
                ypos <- ylim[2] + yoffset
            else ypos <- ylim[1] - yoffset
        }
        if (missing(col))
            col <- rep(1, length(legend))
        for (i in 1:length(legend)) {
            if (!missing(pch))
                points(xpos, ypos, type = "p", pch = pch[i],
                  col = col[i])
            if (!missing(lty))
                lines(c(xpos - markwidth, xpos), c(ypos, ypos),
                  type = "l", lty = lty[i], col = col[i])
            xpos <- xpos + markwidth
            text(xpos, ypos, legend[i])
            xpos <- xpos + legendwidth[i] + 2 * markwidth
        }
        par(oldpar)
    }
    else cat("Usage: legend.mar([side=1] [, xpos] [, ypos], legend [,
lty] [, pch] [, col=1])\n")
}


Bit rough, but I hope it helps.

Jim

Has anyone succeeded in using HDF5 in R?

Using Solaris R version 0.64.0:

1) R was configured in this way:

  cd /home/westley/R/R-0.64.0
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/westley/HDF/lib
  ./configure \
     --prefix=/home/westley/R \

     --x-lib=/usr/openwin/lib \
     --with-hdf5-libs=/home/westley/HDF/lib

2) But, when I attempt to load an HDF file, I get this message:

   Error in hdf5load(file, load) : HDF5 support unavailable

R doesn't have this configure option.  However, if you pass
LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS to configure, you can get the same effect:

CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/HDF/include LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/HDF/lib ./configure

Subject: [R] vsize and nsize
Message-ID: <v04003a19b3621057eb2e@[128.200.28.182]>

I am running R version ??? under Redhat 5.2.  It seems as though the
--nsize object has no effct on the size of the allocated Ncells as
determined using gc().  Yes, I have that much data....

That is if I envoke R with

R --vsize 100 --nsize 5000000

then type

gc()

I get

	free		total
Ncells	92202		200000
Vcells	12928414	13107200

Well, we do need to know what ??? is (is it so hard?: it appears on the
start-up banner, or use Version()). There are limits to both nsize and
vsize, but they are currently 20000000 and 2048M.  If you try to specify
more than the limit, you will get a warning about the limit being ignored.
(Have you overlooked that as well as the start-up banner?) Given that a
recent version of R will object to --vsize 100 (it should be 100M), I
surmise yours is not 0.64.1 and suggest you upgrade.

The limits are OS-specific compile-time settings: look in src/unix/system.c
to change them for Linux. The real limit on vsize is LONG_MAX, slightly
greater on a 32-bit machine, and I guess the limit on nsize is chosen to be
comparable (it is harder to need lots of ncells).  However, as Ross has
said here, R is not designed for very large computations so the current
limits may be rather academic.

Brian (and group):

	Whoops.  I wrote the message meaning to look at the version number
and fill it, but then somehow forgot.  I am running version 0.63.2 (and
with the compile-time settings below was not getting and error message) --
so an upgrade is in order.  The other advice (regarding compile-time
settings) is also very useful.  Much appreciated.

	I agree that R is not "designed" for large calculations.  On the
other hand it is nice to have one statistical package to use for all
calculations.  I mostly deal with Drosophila and DNA, as such I  am an
amateur statistician and would like to avoid learning a number of
statistical languages.  With a big Linux box, I can often power through
things.  In the past I have found it frustrating to do a bunch of stuff in
SAS only to hit a snag and then have to write (time consuming) "C" code to
finish the job.  So although not designed for large calculations, R is so
flexible and logical that it is very attractive to use it for such...I
think that many other people may be similarly attracted to the language.  I
would appreciate dialog, as I think that much more may have been
accomplished in R than was intended by the founders.

The maintainer is Lyndon Drake, who is a computer science graduate
student here at Auckland.  Most work on R here goes on in the (southern)
summer break: Nov - Feb.

We do plan a much more complete Gnome interface.  This is being held
up by some lack of features in Gnome.  One major problem is that we
would like to use the anti-aliasing facilities of of Gnome graphics,
without the overhead of the Gnome Canvas.  My understanding is that
this requires more work on the Gnome printing model.

We would also like an interface to the Gnumeric spreadsheet.

That is specified as giving:

cxy=c(x1,y1)    character size (width and height) in usr coordinates.

When I needed this (V&R2, p.74) I used for the height yinch(par("csi")).
The width is a lot less clearcut, since R (and indeed S-PLUS) allows
variable-width fonts. I would use strwidth() to find the actual width.
There is also strheight(), but I think that computes the actual
height rather than the nominal height given by par("cxy").

I think that  (0.57*xinch(par("csi")), yinch(par("csi"))) is a reasonable
substitute, 0.57 coming from some experiments I did when I first
encountered this.

The NEWS file says: 

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.0

    o   Support for handling embedded '\n's in text strings
        handed to low-level graphics functions has been added.
        Some changes to the PostScript graphics driver were
        needed to support this, so there may some minor change
        in the appearance of plots produced in PostScript.

but this does not work for me even on postscript devices on Unix.
e.g.

plot(1:3, 1:3)
text(1, 2, "test1\ntest2\ntest3")

This does however work on R-0.65.0, so you might like to compile up the 
current development version. (Can someone explain that comment? Is it
just premature?)

It's a problem... possibly with gnome, though. I'm not going to try a
compile at this moment (although I do have access to Sol2.6, there's
no gnome on that machine), but the offending lines read:

    25  extern char *dcgettext(const char *, const char *, const int);
    26  extern char *dgettext(const char *, const char *);
    27  extern char *gettext(const char *);
    28  extern char *textdomain(const char *);
    29  extern char *bindtextdomain(const char *, const char *);

Errors like the ones you're getting generally comes from having
dcgettext() and friends previously defined as macros. This doesn't
seem to be happening anywhere in the R sources, so I'm suspecting
gnome.h... 

If you run the exact same gcc command but add the -E flag, you'll be
able to see exactly what the C preprocessor is doing to your code.

Subject: [R] installing under IRIX 6.3
Message-ID: <37402042.51F396AF@closun.snv.jussieu.fr>

Dear All:

I'm new to R, though I've used S+ on Windows. Since now I'm working on a
SGI, I would like to switch to R.

I'm trying to install R v.0.64.1 on a Silicon Graphics R5000 under IRIX
6.3, 180 MHz, 128 Mb RAM, but ran into some problems.
When I do the ./configure everything goes well, but when I do the make I
get the following error:

ld: ERROR 33: Unresolved text symbol "__builtin_alignof" -- 1st
referenced by errors.o.
ld: INFO 60: Output file removed because of error.
make[2]: *** [../../bin/R.binary] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/abiusers/people/erocha/RHOME/src/main'
make[1]: *** [R] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/abiusers/people/erocha/RHOME/src'
make: *** [R] Error 1

I have switched from my native make to GNU make, I use gcc, and have
also made the changements suggested by George White in the Mathlib.h
file (the so-called SGI madness ). Nevertheless I cannot pass through
this point...

Does anyone have an idea on how to correct this?

Thanks in advance,

Eduardo Rocha

PS- I also tried the version 64.0, but had the same error.

R's poor handling of large datasets is half the reason I have
not moved more of my work from S(plus) to R (the other half
being the absence of trellis).  I love its lexical closures, but
they're not worth the memory penalty if you have huge datasets.

Maybe someday R will get something akin to Perl's 'tie'
mechanism that would allow practical analysis of huge
datasets.  Maybe that's not possible.

Hi, everyone, I was downloading the rm0641b.zip etc.
(thanks to Guido Masarotto and Brian Ripley) 
I noticed rw0641sp.zip there, which do not seem mentioned
in the News file. 

My guess is that it is not a binary file?
Is is a source patch file(?) for compiling on Wintel PC?

[Moved over from R-devel, because I think it belongs here - MTP]

I don't know about problem 1, but problem 2 is caused by you mixing
libraries compiled with gcc and egcs. So you should either
1) Remove egcs-1.1 and any other bleeding edge stuff you have installed
   and go back to a standard RedHat 5.2 installation, or
2) Upgrade to RedHat 6.0.

There is a known hack for this problem which involves preloading a small
shared library containing __register_frame_info, __deregister_frame_info
__unregister_frame_info as null functions. I wouldn't do that myself
though.

Um, I wonder how I've been running EGCS 1.1 for the last six months
then... I just put /home/sfe/pd/misc/EGCS/bin at the beginning of my
PATH. Isn't it more likely that Michael has an installation problem or
needs to compile g++/g77 along with gcc?

  It is mentioned in the README. It is the minimal
  set of files that you need to build (compile) new
  packages (alternative is downloading all the R source

To amplify that a little, there is no longer a source patch file for
Windows. Everything needed to compile on Windows is in the standard source
distribution as of R-0.64.1.  See the readme, readme.packages and rw-FAQ
for fuller details.

Well, I have suggested R-Linux is needed, somewhat in jest, as R-help

Ditto (for less time, but with RH 5.2). I can confirm that the problem 1
occurs with an mal-functioning compiler setup: it happens to me on Solaris
unless the library paths are set up specially.

I think you need compatible gcc/g77, but both from egcs 1.1.2 works for me.
As R is linked with g77, the messages suggest that an older g77 was used.

Thanks for all the replies.  Some of them (with my info added) follow.

This has crossed my mind.  I do not know which packages on my system
(if any) depend on a particular version of libstdc++, so I have not
removed any of them.

Maybe when it reaches 6.2 :)

Maybe... But many other packages using the
	./configure ; make all check install
sequence have installed without problems, e.g. Python, Tcl, Ocaml.
Most importantly, my prior R version ( R-63-? ) installed cleanly.

> needs to compile g++/g77 along with gcc?

They were all compiled together.  From g77 -v:
	g77 version egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release) (from
	FSF-g77 version 0.5.24-19980804)
Similar output from gcc and g++

I've written just such an interface.  It ties proxy objects (subclassed from
data.frame) to postgres tables (it should be easy to write drivers for any
rdbms).  The library needs a bit of cleaning up and documenting before I release
the package.  I did run into some significant problems trying to subclass the
data.frame type, but I think they can be fixed (the current version knows nothing
about R internals).

Both of these things are being worked on for R 1.0, but I can't give
any timeframe, sorry.  I have a design for the memory changes and have
begun implementation experiments.  Paul Murrell and some others are
thinking about a ``lattice'' graphics package -- the name ``trellis''
begin trademarked :-)

My "large" datasets generally consist of high-time-resolution
energy consumption data.  One example is a dataset of electric
utility distribution feeder measurements I analyzed a few years
ago.  It was two years worth of half-hourly data (about 17,500
rows) from over 3000 metering points (columns).  At double
precision, that's almost a half-Gig of data.  I've had other
datasets that totalled several Gigs.

In S I can't put all that into a data frame, but I *can* create
3000 independent (but parallel) vectors and toss them in a
separate directory that I attach as needed.  Since I tend to
analyze the columns sequentially (or a few at a time) rather
than all at once, the memory penalty for having lots of columns
in the dataset is basically negligible.  R, on the other hand,
wants to hold everything in memory unless I really work hard
to break up the dataset into smaller chunks.

I'm very glad to hear that the R developers are working on a
mechanism to get around R's memory hunger.

Jim:

	So now I am confused.  I have two vectors: var and pow.  var has a
dozen or so "levels".  (I can not apply factor to var either)  Here is a
sample of my R session:

length(var)
94429
lenght(pow)
94429
tapply(pow,var,mean)
Error: heap memory (1953 Kb) exhausted [needed 737 more]....
var2 <- var[1:100]
pow2 <- pow[1:100]
tapply(pow2,var2,mean)
0	0.06

As I stated in previous messages the version of R I have ( 0.63.2 ) could
not increase heap memory, Brian Ripley suggested I upgrade to a newer
version (0.64.1, which I haven't done yet) -- so I can not tell you if this
solves the problem or not...

While I agree that R isn't much use for really big datasets, I am a bit
surprised by Jim's comments about glm(). I have used R (including glm)
perfectly satisfactorily on real data sets of ten thousand or so
observations. This isn't large by today's standards but it isn't in
any sense toy data.

0.63.2 _can_ increase heap memory: you reported problems with cells not
heap, as in (your posting of Sat May 15)

    That is if I envoke R with

    R --vsize 100 --nsize 5000000

    then type

    gc()

    I get

            free            total
    Ncells  92202           200000
    Vcells  12928414        13107200

the problem being that the value you were trying for nsize is over the
limit, 1000000 on 0.63.2 on Unix, and this was ignored (and you should
have got a warning, as the code issues one).  You got the 100Mb of
heap your requested. However, 0.64.1 will allow this value of nsize.

For routine use a R --vsize 10 --nsize 300000 would be suitable for that
version on a machine with 64Mb or more.

Me too, and I have done this in S as well (often with a lot less memory
usage than R). I don't believe scoping rules have anything to do with this
(and glm uses R's scoping rules as well: it is hard to use anything else in
R!), but how code is written does. Bill Venables and I had various
discussions at the last S-PLUS users' conference about whether one could
ever justify using regressions, say, with more than 10,000 cases. Points
against include

- such datasets are unlikely to be homogeneous and better analysed in
  natural strata.
- statistical significance is likely to occur at practically insignificant
  levels of effects.

and the `for' points include

- it may be a legal requirement to use all the data,
- datasets can be very unbalanced, as in 70,000 normals and 68 diseased
  (but then one can sub-sample the normals).

However, that is for statistical analysis, not dataset manipulations.

I think I started this by quoting Ross as saying that R is not designed for
large datasets (and neither was S version 3). Large was in the context of a
100Mb heap and 80Mb ncells space, which I think answers Jim's question (go
up a couple of orders of magnitude).  Remember that the S developers came
from the Unix `tools' background and said they expected tools such as awk
to be used to manipulate datasets. These days we (and probably them) prefer
more help.

Subject: [R] random crashing GLM
Message-ID: <3741B108.4B6B3DAA@gironet.nl>

I am trying to fit a GLM model using R (version 0.64.1 Win95) onto a
dataframe(dtse) consisting of 3348 rows with 4 variables:
- 3 factors: (c)31 levels, (m)12 levels (s)9 levels)
- 1 integer: (n)
The data consists of counts and is strongly overdispersed.

I try fit the following model
dtse.glm<- glm(n~s+c+m, data=dtse, family=quasi(link=log, variance=mu))

When I issue this command R sometimes answers, but sometimes (using the
same dataset) simply crashes without any error message in the R-console.
Only the standard Win95 error-dialog appears.

Can anybody advise me how to overcome (workaround) this problem.

Message-ID: <199905181829.OAA16136@t3.mscf.uky.edu>

I installed rw0641 from the binary rw0641b.zip
but not the help files (not rw0641h, not rw0641w ). 

I do not like the MDI so I edited the ./etc/Rconsole to read

MDI = no 

and I commented out 

#toolbar = yes
#statusbar = yes

and I even changed 

pagerstyle = singlewindows


Now when I start Rgui, and do > ?ls
causes R to crash, instead of reporting "help page not found".

Is there something I need to edit so that R will not crash when
no help pages are found? (Rprofile?)

Thanks in advance.

Is there a way to turn pager off on rw0641?
(The separate window that display the help files)

The problem of SDI crashing R when you do ?ls and
there is no help files do not occure in MDI.

(SDI sound like Reagan's star war...:-) )

The help pages are not optional: you must install them. There is no
protection (nor in the Unix version) against blatently ignoring the
instructions: as the rw-FAQ says

  1.1) Where can I find the latest version?

  Go to any CRAN site (see http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R/mirrors.html for a
  list), navigate to the bin/windows/windows-NT/base directory and collect
  the files you need. You will need at least the files

      rw06xxb.zip rw06xxh.zip

I don't understand why if you are so clever as not to need the help pages
you could not work this out for yourself!  It is not the help pages that
are not found, but the indices, and they are _essential_.  If you randomly
remove parts of the R installation, it will indeed crash.

The short answer is no. Part of the reason is that R and S-PLUS differ in
the way they manage objects in memory. It is possible to link GIS and R,
though - I've been able to move data back and forth between GRASS and R
without major difficulties (under Unix). What kind of link are you
thinking of, and for what kind of data - raster, point or polygon?

Help!
I'm running successfully R_0.64.1 under windows95 with bother and
thoroughly enjoying using it, but I would prefer to run under UNIX, I
downloaded the various files but I'm coming across the following
problem. Can anybody suggest anything to help me.
Executing
./configure --prefix=/myworkspace/R

leads me to

R is now configured for mips-sgo-irix6.4

   Source directory:		.
   Installation directory:	/myworkspace/R
   C compiler:			gcc -c -02
   FORTRAN compiler		f77
   Gnome support:		no

Fine up to here. When I tried make, I got the following error

UX:make: ERROR: make: file `Makefile' line 49: bad character & (octal
46)
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

But on reading line 49 of the Makefile, no '&' character is there.
The line is
	@(cd $(srcdir); \
	  for f in COPYING COPYRIGHTS MIRROR-SITES RESOURCES; do \
	    $(INSTALL_DATA) $${f} $(rhome); \     		   # LINE 49
	  done)

Any ideas?!

Thanks

Haven't seen that one before, I think, but the knee-jerk reflex is to
ask you to try GNU make instead. If that's inconvenient, you should
probably first look into the definition of the variables that get
expanded on line 49 and see if they somehow got to contain an &.

The variable definitions are generally in Makeconf in the top build
directory.

Perhaps

paste('"',getenv("RHOME"),'"',sep="")

etc.

trecons is a vector, but accessC returns the "smooth" coefficients of some
wavelet decomposition. Therefore accessC(trecons) does not make sense.
If you want to plot the reconstructed function try simply 

> plot(trecons)

(maybe with an optional ty="l" argument to get straight lines)

If you want to extract the smooth coefficients at level j, try something
like

> tdecomp.Cj<-accessC(tdecomp.thresh,level=j)

Yes: library MASS (part of the V&R bundle) has functions lda and qda.
If you want `discriminant analysis' in a broader sense there are
lots more: tree, rpart, polymars, class, nnet, ....

Subject: [R] survival5 for windows
Message-ID: <199905241449.KAA17241@t6.mscf.uky.edu>

I downloaded binary of survival5 for windows95 
(also the splines, date).

The function survsum shows up in content, has a help page, 
but the function itself is missing. 

Can we cut and paste the survsum from survival4 ? 

Mai Zhou 


P.S. 
I am not picking on R, not even complaining.
I think R is great and I am try to contribute my (small) part
to make it even better in way of bug report (or may be not a bug, 
but just differences to previous release). 

I thought this is a given for people on this list. But was I wrong.....

survsum() is also missing in the S release of survival5 I was working from
-- I hadn't noticed because I never use it and it isn't tested by the test
suite or by make check.

The version from survival4 should work in the same way that it used to. I
will check to see whether it has disappeared deliberately or just by bit
rot.

Subject: [R] sum(is.na(c(...)) -> negative number; bug or feature?
Message-ID: <3749893C.4F28FFAE@enteract.com>

As I understand it, sum() treats a logical vectors as 1's and 0's, so
that

> is.logical(c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE))
[1] TRUE
> sum(c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE))
[1] 1

However,  summing the results of an is.na() yields a
negative number.  Eg

> is.na(c(1,NA,3))
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE
> is.logical(is.na(c(1,NA,3)))
[1] TRUE
> sum(is.na(c(1,NA,3)))
[1] -1

(This is from R Version 0.64.0, under Redhat Linux 5.2 (compiled from
scratch
 using egcs-g77-1.0.3a-14, although I can't imagine that's relevant).

Is this a bug, or is there something about sum() that I'm missing?

Thanks

Bug in is.na(), fixed in 0.64.1.

Apparently, POSIX only specifies that isnan() returns nonzero on NaN's
and RH5.2 took that literally...

I am using rw0.63.2.

I haven't upgraded because we use R for teaching. Students use R at
home, and we don't want to change them over in midsemester.

Also we have some additional functions we use, and we need to test them
before we start to use a new version. Which brings me to my question.

To help with testing we are preparing a test file which will run through
all our examples. In the course of this we have run into a problem which I
think is a Windows limitation which will probably be easily explained by
Brian or Guido. 

We have the commands in a file and just source it to run the checks. After
we go through a number of scans to read in data sets R stops with the
message scan can't open file. This I know normally means it can't find it.
If we restart R and run that bit of code separately there is no problem.

What I believe is happening is that Windows has a limit on the number of
files that can be open at any one time. Is that the case?

Also when scan is used, the file remains open or reserved by R.

So, is my understanding correct? Is there any way to close a file and
to keep on reading more files? 

We can work around by cutting up our test file, but I'm curious.

There is alot on how to do it under Unix.
The windows FAQ briefly mentions it but
does not explain it.

I have donwloaded windows binaries of the package
"clust.zip" and unzipped it into my

Subject: [R] Muliple partial matches with pmatch
Message-ID: <3.0.1.32.19990525151600.006b8798@anugpo.anu.edu.au>

I am using R0.64.1 under Windows 95.

The help for `pmatch' states that:

        If `duplicates.ok' is false multiple matches will result
        in the value of `nomatch' being returned, and if it is
        true, the index of the first matching value will be
        returned.

The help for pmatch gives the following examples:

        pmatch("m",   c("mean", "median", "mode")) # returns NA
        pmatch("med", c("mean", "median", "mode")) # returns 2

What I find is:

> pmatch("m",c("median","mean","mode"))
[1] 3

> pmatch("me",c("median","mean","mode"))
[1] NA

> pmatch("me",c("median","mean","mede"))
[1] 3

> pmatch("me",c("median","mean","mode"),duplicates.ok=T)
[1] 1

Is this a bug?

Binaries for many packages are available at
CRAN/bin/windows/windows-NT/contrib. These are zip files which should
be unpacked in rw0641\library. They are then available for use. You
can also use the installer rwinst.exe to selectively unpack the zip
files.

So you followed the instructions, which are mentioned briefly because they
are brief!

> Now what do I do ?

Find your R documentation and read it!  Use of libraries is not a
Windows-specific issue, and I think you are confusing installing libraries
(and that is what is in the FAQs) and loading them.

> library(cluster)

will make this available for use.  See ?library for more details, or
read a good book on S/S-PLUS, as R works in exactly the same way.

However, please don't use such an old version of R for Windows: we are
on rw0641 now. In particular, the `windows binaries' are mainly for
rw0640/1 only: I hope you downloaded from the obselete rw063x section.

Please don't do that. Use rterm and redirect the input, as in the rw-FAQ
section on running batch files.  The use of source increases the 
memory usage (because of all the delayed commitments), suppresses
autoprinting (as the evaluation is not at the top level) and often
breaks things (ditto).

All OSes have such a limit. But it depends on the version of Windows, and
is unlikely to be biting here. How many files are you opening? I think this
is much more likely to be a resources problem than a lack of file handles.

scan() explicitly closes the file unless it is a tty, that is no name is
given and you read from the terminal.

When I create the MASS library I scan (sometimes via read.table) a hundred
or so files in succession and see no problems.  But I do not do this in
source().

Of course it is... and one that seems strangely familiar. Did we fix

I think it was another thing we had earlier. This one is due to logic
of the following type

match=0
for each target
	if (input matches target)
		if (match)
			match=0
		else 
			match=target number

I.e. flip-flop... So if there's an odd number of matches, it returns
the last one; if there's an even number it declares no-match. Will
fix.

Loading the new version of R and it all worked fine.

Well, that is the case, but this is far from the only package for
which that occurs. The message has been put in R 0.64.x to encourage
package writers to follow the recommendations and include an index.

The only thing you can't do is to list the datasets.

(I dithered a bit about whether this belongs on r-help
 (as part of it is a general R question) or r-devel
 (as it's a question relating to putting stuff on
 CRAN) but decided it might be of general enough interest
 to go on the former )


I am currently preparing an R library to estimate 
approximate posterior distributions for parameters in
Generalised Linear Mixed Models by Gibbs Sampling
which includes a lot of dynamically loaded C code.
I'm pleased with the way in which it is working and am 
now hammering out some documentation, but closer consideration
of some R documentation has led me to worry that my code
a) may not achieve certain standards of R and C programming
and b) may not work on all systems. (I'm using 0.64.1
on a UNIX system)

My worries are

a) That I've used calloc rather than S_alloc throughout.

b) That I've used the following technique: I've
   calls to different C programs held together in a single
   file which looks like:

      GLM g;  /* information about the model */
      OUTPUT o; /* information about the output *

      f1(g){ ....... }
      f2(g,o) { ......}



    (GLM and OUTPUT are 
    typedefs defined in a .h file)


    with an R function that looks like :
    {
      <R statements>

      .C("f1",.....)

      <R statements>
 
      .C("f2",.....)       

       <R statements>

       ...

      }
 
and I rely on the fact that "g" and "o" remain the same between the successive
calls (there's a C call at the end to free up all the memory).  is this:

      1) bad,
      2) so bad (-;) that the R archive wouldn't really be interested in code
         that worked in this way?

I *think* I can do it without using this technique, but it will need a lot
of re-programming.  One way round it in S v5 uses the new .Call() 
function---is anything similar on the agenda for future versions of R?

On another note, where in the library structure would be a good     
place to put a LaTeX document describing the function and showing
some examples?

Thanks,

Jonathan

The same technique is used in the survival5 library, which seems to work
on a number of platforms. I think it's undesirable, but not disastrous.  
Basically, if you do (b) you have to do (a) since R does not preserve
S_alloc memory across calls (I believe this differs from S-PLUS)

The two reasons why it's undesirable are: 
  1. it means that R can use much more memory than the specified heap
sizes, making it harder to tell how big these can safely be set without
swapping.

  2. If the program is interrupted (ctrl-c) between calloc() and free() it
will leak memory.

The second problem should be fixable with on.exit().

One way around this problem is to use the new and almost undocumented
.External() interface, which allows you to write "internal" R commands and
allocate memory on the R heap. This can save a lot of copying and gives
you more control over the allocation of memory. The disadvantages are that
the API is unstable and largely undocumented, and that it gives you more
control over the allocation of memory (so you need to be aware of things
like garbage collection).

I would put it at the top level, or possibly in a doc/ subdirectory. I
don't think there are even informal standards on this.

Using calloc and free in C code loaded by R is fine.  We would
recommend that you use the macros Calloc and Free defined in the S.h

You are in luck.  There is a facility in R called .External which is
much like the .Call facility in S-PLUS 5.x.  Saikat DebRoy has written
some documentation on that.  It would be in the development tree now
except that I was going to a bit of editing on it.  I can send you a
preview copy if you like.  Please tell me if you can handle texinfo
format.

If you haven't already done so, please read the output from the R call
 help(library)
That contains information on how to structure your own libraries.

The preferred way to write the documentation is in a LaTeX-like
formulation called the R documentation (.Rd) format.  Those files are put in
the "man" subdirectory of your library.  R INSTALL <libname> then
converts those files to html, LaTeX, and ASCII formats when it
installs the library.  Furthermore it strips out the examples that you
use in there so you can, for example, do things like
 library(MASS)
 example(boxcox)
to run the example.

Furthermore, you can use
 R CMD check <libname>
to run all the examples in your library - a good way of testing that
changes you have made in your code have not botched things up in
unsuspected ways.  In computing this is known as regression testing
but the name "regression" there does not refer to the statistical
concept of regression modeling.

Just use Calloc and Free: these are defined in S.h and (a) let R do the
error-checking and (b) on Windows ensures you get a malloc that can
actually free space.

I am not clear about this.  Do you rely on g and o remaining the same
or their addresses remaining the same? And if the latter, you don't need
to pass g in again.  Garbage collection will move objects, but nothing
in R will alter them. So on my second reading of this, there is no
problem. You might want to try us on a more specific example.

(It is S-PLUS 5.x or Sv4, I think.)

There is already a .External call for a very similar purpose.  I find
programming R internals a little easier than .Call().

Anything you put in inst gets installed, so I would suggest in  inst/doc.
By no means all R users have LaTeX, so give a .ps or a .pdf version too,
please.

Dear R users

How can I create 3D barplots in R.
In Splus it is possible to create 3D barplots via graphical menus,
but it would be nice to able to create 3D barplots via the command line in
R.

Any help/hints will be greatly appreciated.

So far as I know, the only 3D plots you can do in R are:
image()
persp()
contour()
filled.contour()

Maybe you mean a 3D barplot with each bar drawn as a solid square
column rather than as a rectangle:
   ________
  /       /
 /       /|
/_______/ |
|      |  |
|      |  |
|      |  |
|      |  |
|      |  |
|      |  |
|      | /
|______|/

If that's what you mean, why on earth would you want that?!

Subject: [R] Unexpected behaviour of read.table
Message-ID: <199905291729.SAA07681@bernstein.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>

When reading comma-delimited files as saved from a spreadsheet (unfortunately 
many of my scientific collaborators give me these) in read.table(), missing 
values are spotted most of the time. Unfortunately when comma is the first 
character on the line it gets it wrong. For example, reading the file

 
1,,3
 ,5,6
,8,9 

with 

read.table("test.dat", header=F, sep=",")

R gives an error:
row.lens=
[1] 3 3 2
Error: all rows must have the same length.

Splus handles this OK and returns

  V1 V2 V3 
1  1 NA  3
2 NA  5  6
3 NA  8  9

as expected.

Note that this discrepancy does NOT occur with scan(..., sep=","), which 
returns

1 NA  3 NA  5  6 NA  8  9

in both R and Splus.

I'm running R-0.63 under Redhat Linux 5.2.  The base module works fine
but I can't get the functions in the other modules(modreg,mva etc) to
run.  The directories for these modules exist and have the function
files in them. However none of them except the 'base' directory has the
Rprofile file in it.

How do I get the functions in these other modules to run?  Presumably I
need to create an Rprofile file in these directories.  How do I do this?

The Rprofile file is for basic customisation, not for package loading.
What you need is 

	library(modreg)	

to load the modreg package and so on.  After this you should be able to
run commands in those packages. You can use 
	search()
to see which packages are currently loaded and in what order and
	detach("package:modreg") 
to unload the package.

Blimey! How did *that* go unnoticed for so long?? I think I've traced
it to the following section in do_countfields

	else if (sepchar) {
	    if (c == sepchar)
		nfields++;
	    else if (nfields == 0)
		nfields++;
	}

I don't think we want that 2nd 'else' there...

Hum. With my suggested change PLUS interchanging the 2 'if's, I now
get:

> read.table('junk',sep=',')
  V1 V2 V3
1  1 NA  3
2     5  6
3 NA  8  9

which on closer thought actually *is* what I'd expect - if you have a
space in a comma-separated field, the column should be of type
character/factor, no?

BTW: "r-testers"?? That address got superseded by the r-help/r-devel
lists something like two years ago.... Arguably, this discussion
should have gone to r-devel, not r-help or even better to r-bugs, so
it would get an official Problem Report number. (I'm leaving it in
r-help for now, since that where the previous messages went, but if we
need to discuss it more extensively, we should probably move it to
r-devel)

I have been attempting to use  Bowman & Azzalini kernel smoothing routines

the variance is increasing with time. The envelope in this case is drawn 
with a constant width. Are there any macros around for smoothing that do 
this or have I missed something?

Subject: [R] "R-testers" has gone the way of all mortals.. //  History
Message-ID: <199905311308.PAA04179@sophie.ethz.ch>

Till this morning, "R-testers at stat.math.ethz.ch" still was a valid alias to
R-help.  It is no longer...

History:

On 1996, Feb 12
   Ross and Robert established a simple `alias mailing list' 
		   (i.e. no automatic un/subscribing; no anti-spam, no nothing)
   <r-alpha-testers at stat.auckland.ac.nz>   of a bit more than a dozen people
   who  ``have had expressed interest in R at some time''
   and announced an R alpha 0.1 (or 0.2?).

On 1996, March 20 and 21
   the list was moved and announced to the "R-testers at stat.math.ethz.ch"
   mailing list with 19 entries.
   
On 1997, April 1 (+/-)
   I established 3 mailing lists instead of 1;
   the low volume R-announce, R-help and R-devel
   {{ where all messages to R-announce are sent R-help automatically
      and still the majority of new subscribers doesn't understand and
      subscribes to BOTH R-announce and R-help..when R-help would be sufficient
   }}
   R-help was inherited from R-testers  and R-testers made an alias for R-help.

On 1999, May 31 (today) -- R-testers is outdated by 26 months and dies.
