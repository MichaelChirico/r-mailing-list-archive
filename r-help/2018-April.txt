Hi John! 

Java was installed with Homebrew Cask as a user, if my memory doesn?t fail me. 

Thanks a lot for your help! Let?s see how the problem evolves.

Thanks Peter! 

Yeah, I don?t think we users can fix this issue. Let?s wait for a fix from rJava team.

Subject: [R] PCA with random effects
Message-ID: <45F935A8-1DE1-4BE5-96C0-BC43A896F009@ucalgary.ca>

I have the results of a rating study in which ~30 participants rated a subset
of 20 items on 25 different dimensions.

I would like to perform PCA on these ratings to reduce the 25 different
dimensions. However, instead of doing this on the mean ratings for each
item, I would like to perform the PCA at the level of individual ratings. I
am assuming that in order to do this I have to specify the fact that ratings
are nested within participants and within items (i.e., crossed random
effects for subjects and items). Is this possible?

Hi All,

I tried to use xgboost to model and predict count data. The predictions are however not as expected as shown below.

Have I miss-specified or missed some parameters? Or there is a bug in xgboost. I am grateful for any help.

This is a statistical question, which is typically off topic here.
This list is primarily concerned with R programming questions,
although the two areas sometimes do intersect. I suggest you post on a
statistical list such as stats.stackexchange.com instead, especially
if you do not get a useful reply here.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] New Package fansi: ANSI Control Sequence Aware String
 Functions
References: <570443092.435468.1522629550677.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <570443092.435468.1522629550677@mail.yahoo.com>

fansi provides counterparts to the base string manipulation functions substr, strwrap, strtrim, strsplit, and n(z)char that account for ANSI CSI SGR control sequences.? ANSI CSI SGR control sequences [1] can be used to format text in terminals that support them.

For example the control sequence "\033[31m" causes text that follows to render in red, and the control sequence "\033[0m" turns off formatting.? So with:

> substr_ctl("\033[31mABC\033[0m", 2, 2)
[1] "\033[31mB\033[0m"

we extract the second letter of the red formatted ABC while retaining the formatting.

fansi is written mostly in C, so its performance is comparable to the corresponding base functions.? There are versions of some of the functions with additional functionality.? For example, `substr2_ctl` supports character-width (as opposed to character-count) based substrings.

fansi is dependency-less.

Feedback is welcome either by e-mail or via github (<https://github.com/brodieG/fansi>).

Subject: [R] parfm unable to fit models when hazard rate is small
Message-ID: <1FBFD3C651590248A8EE6C86B93BE4173318DF26@MBXP01.ds.man.ac.uk>

Hello, I would like to use the parfm package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parfm/parfm.pdfhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parfm/parfm.pdf in my work. This package fits parametric frailty models to survival data. To ensure I was using it properly, I started by running some small simulations to generate some survival data (without any random effects), and analyse the data using the parfm package. I am using an exponential baseline hazard. When the baseline hazard rate drops to 0.001, I get the following error when trying to fit the model:

Error in optimHess(par = ESTIMATE, fn = Mloglikelihood, obs = obsdata,  :
  non-finite finite-difference value [1]
In addition: Warning message:
In log(pars) : NaNs produced

Has anybody else come across this issue, or could suggest why parfm struggles with low event rates? Or could someone please run my code to see if they get the same issue? Full reproducible code is presented below.

Many thanks for any help,
Alex

CODE:

### Create function to generate data
simulWeib <- function(N, lambda, rho, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4, rateC, sigma)
{
  # covariate --> N Bernoulli trials
  x1 <- sample(x=c(0, 1), size=N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5, 0.5))

  # Now create random effect stuff
  # Create one vector of length N, all drawn from same normal distribution
  rand.effect <- rnorm(N,0,sigma)

  # Weibull latent event times
  v <- runif(n=N)
  Tlat <- round((- log(v) / (lambda * exp(x1 * beta1 + rand.effect)))^(1 / rho))
  multiplier = exp(x1 * beta1 + rand.effect)
  haz=lambda * exp(x1 * beta1 + rand.effect)

  # censoring times
  #C <-rep(100000,N)
  C <- rexp(n=N, rate=rateC)

  # follow-up times and event indicators
  time <- pmin(Tlat, C)
  #status <- as.numeric(rep(1,N))
  status <- as.numeric(Tlat <= C)

  # data set
  data.frame(id=1:N,
             id10=ceiling(1:N/10),
             time=time,
             status=status,
             x1 = as.factor(x1),
             re=rand.effect,
             multiplier=multiplier,
             haz=haz)
}

### The reason it doesn't work is becayse the event rate gets so small!!
set.seed(101)

# Note that although data generated is for weibull, I set rho = 1 so it reduces to an exponential hazard, with rate = lambda
# Also note sigma = 0, so random effect is not present

## Create data and fit model, lambda = 0.1
data0<-simulWeib(10000,lambda=0.1,rho=1,rateC=0.0000000001, beta1=0.25,beta2=0,beta3=0,beta4=0, sigma = 0)
fit.cox0<-parfm(Surv(time,status) ~ x1, data=data0, dist="exponential")
fit.cox0

## Create data and fit model, lambda = 0.01
data0<-simulWeib(10000,lambda=0.01,rho=1,rateC=0.0000000001, beta1=0.25,beta2=0,beta3=0,beta4=0, sigma = 0)

Subject: [R] Plot data in sequence

Hi r-users,

I would like to draw line plots. However, the plot starts from 11121 data
and plot data ENTRY last in the plot.

Here is the code and data.

datn <- read.table(header=TRUE, text='
LEVEL   STATUS      CGPA
DIPLOMA ENTRY 3.32
DIPLOMA 11121 2.91
DIPLOMA 11122 2.90

STAM 14152 2.77
')

ggplot(data=datn, aes(x=STATUS, y=CGPA, group=LEVEL,
colour=LEVEL),cex.axis=0.2, ylim=c(0,4)) +
    geom_line(size=1.3) +
    geom_point()+

    theme(legend.title=element_blank(),legend.position=c(.3,
.3),axis.text.x = element_text(size=8),axis.text=element_text(size=10))

Thank you very much.

Hi,

Thanks for the reproducible example.

Looking at
str(datn)
would give you a clue.
STATUS is a factor because it contains character values. Factor levels
by default are alphabetical with numbers first, but you can change
those.

> str(datn)
'data.frame': 36 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ LEVEL : Factor w/ 4 levels "DIPLOMA","MATRIC",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 ...
 $ STATUS: Factor w/ 9 levels "11121","11122",..: 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
 $ CGPA  : num  3.32 2.91 2.9 2.89 2.89 2.93 2.96 2.76 2.73 2.77 ...

> levels(datn$STATUS)
[1] "11121" "11122" "12131" "12132" "13141" "13142" "14151" "14152" "ENTRY"
> datn$STATUS <- factor(datn$STATUS, levels=c("ENTRY", "11121", "11122", "12131", "12132", "13141", "13142", "14151", "14152"))
> levels(datn$STATUS)
[1] "ENTRY" "11121" "11122" "12131" "12132" "13141" "13142" "14151" "14152"

Reorder the levels to your desired outcome, and then plot the data again.

This package fits parametric frailty models to survival data. To ensure I was using it properly, I started by running some small simulations to generate some survival data (without any random effects), and analyse the data using the parfm package. I am using an exponential baseline hazard. When the baseline hazard rate drops to 0.001, I get the following error when trying to fit the model:

Please what is the function and syntax to obtain gradient values for the model curve at various requested values, e.g.:

when graphdata[,1] at values = 100, 250, 350 ?

This smells like homework, which the Posting Guide indicates is off topic.

I am not aware of "the function" that will solve this, but if you know what a gradient is analytically then you should be able to put together a solution very similar to the code you already have with the addition of using the coef function.

For the benefit of other novices, used the following command to read the documentation:

?coef

Then tried and obtained:

> cvalue100<-coef(graphmodelp~100)
> cvalue100
NULL

Then looked at the model values which of course correspond to original non-modelled values.

graphmodelp
        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8 
91.244636 69.457794 52.873083 40.248368 30.638107 23.322525 17.753714 13.514590 
        9        10        11 
10.287658  7.831233  5.961339

This prompted to think that interpolation is required, but the function 'approx' only seems to perform constant interpolation.

Is the correct thinking to find a function to perform interpolation, then find/write a function to differentiate the model at a specific value of x, to find gradient at that point?

Try

coef( graphmodeld )

And you don't need to approximate if you use the newdata argument to the predict function.

I think reading the "Introduction to R" that comes with R would help.

  coef(graphmodelp)

Read up on ?predict and what it delivers when only a model is offered as input.

Not correct. You already have `predict`. It is capale of using the `newdata` values to do interpolation with the values of the coefficients in the model. See: 

?predict

The original question asked for a derivative (i.e. a "gradient"), but so far it's not clear that you understand the mathematical definiton of that term. We also remain unclear whether this is homework.

coef(graphmodelp)
Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors

A quick search engine query revealed primarily references to the dollar sign ($) operator which does not seem relevant to this question.

The motivation of this post was simple differentiation of a tangent point (dy/dx) manually, then wondering how to re-think in modern-day computing terms. Hence the original question about asking the appropriate functions/syntax to read further ("curiosity"), not the answer (indeed, "homework"). :)

Personal curiosity should be considered "homework".

You did not try my suggestion. You tried David's, which has a leftover mistake from your guesses about what the argument to coef should be.

Yes, sorry for the mistake.

coef(graphmodeld)
   (Intercept) graphdata[, 1] 
   4.513544204   -0.006820623

This corresponds to the linear model but it is still not understood how this helps to determine gradients at specific points for the exponential model.

You have fitted log(y) against x. Your fitted linear model is therefore 
log(y) = 4.5135 - 0.00682x

From there:
- do the basic algebra to get y in terms of x
- differentiate analytically to get dy/dx as a function of x.
- write that calculation in R to get your gradients at any value of x.

Or you could get R to give you the differential function from your function for y; see ?D

Besides symbolic differentiation, there is also the option of numeric differentiation. Here's an amateurish attempt:

myNumDeriv <- function(x){ (exp( predict (graphmodeld, newdata=data.frame(t=x+.0001))) - 
                                            exp( predict (graphmodeld, newdata=data.frame(t=x) )))/
                                          .0001 }
myNumDeriv(c(100, 250, 350))

Since 2008, Microsoft staff and guests have written about R at the Revolutions
blog (http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com) and every month I post a summary of
articles from the previous month of particular interest to readers of r-help.

In case you missed them, here are some articles related to R from the
month of March:

I realized that this would not work in the context of your construction. I had earlier made a more symbolic version using R formulae:

 graphdata<-read.csv(text='t,c
 0,100
 40,78
 80,59
 120,38
 160,25
 200,21
 240,16
 280,12
 320,10
 360,9
 400,7')
 graphmodeld<-lm(log(c)~t, graphdata)
 graphmodelp<-exp(predict(graphmodeld))
 plot(c~t, graphdata)
 lines(graphdata[,1],graphmodelp)
 myNumDeriv(c(100, 250, 350), graphmodeld )

Again I attempt to correct my incomplete code with this definition that had be modified to take a model object as its second argument:

myNumDeriv <- function(x, mod) (exp( predict (mod, newdata=data.frame(t=x+.0001))) - exp( predict (mod, newdata=data.frame(t=x) )))/.0001

R-experts,

I have fitted many different lines. The fast-tau estimator (yellow line) seems strange to me?because this yellow line is not at all in agreement with the other lines (reverse slope, I mean the yellow line has a positive slope and the other ones have negative slope). 
Is there something wrong in my R code ? Is it because the Y variable is 1 vector and should be a matrix ?

Here is the reproducible code

###############

It's not quite reproducible:? you forgot the line to create Dataset. 
It's probably something like

Dataset <- data.frame(Y, Z)

abline() doesn't know what to do with the "fast" object.? It isn't a 
vector containing intercept and slope, it's a list containing them.? So 
you'll need something like

abline(unlist(fast), col="yellow")

You need to pay attention to the documentation more closely. If you don't 
know what something means, that is usually a signal that you need to study 
more... in this case about the difference between an input variable and a 
design (model) matrix. This is a concept from the standard linear algebra 
formulation for regression equations. (Note that I have never used RobPer, 
nor do I regularly mess with model matrices, but I do recognize the term 
"design matrix" and used help.search("design matrix") to track this down.)

Thanks for the reprex, though it is highly irregular to intersperse 
install.packages in code that may be run more than once.

I have never found the R symbolic differentiation helpful because my 
functions are typically quite complicated, but was prompted by Steve 
Ellison's suggestion to try it out in this case:

nd <- c( 100, 250, 300 )
graphmodeld <- lm( log(c) ~ t, data = graphdta )
graphmodelplin <- predict( graphmodeld
                          , newdata = data.frame( t = nd )
                          )

R users may want to note that there are some extensions in packages for symbolic derivatives.

In particular, Duncan Murdoch added some "all in R" tools in the package nlsr that I maintain. This
is a substitute for the nls() function that uses a fairly unsatisfactory forward difference derivative
approximation. Moreover, the solver in nlsr is a variant of the Marquardt stabilized Gauss-Newton
approach, rather than the straight Gauss-Newton that often gives a "singular gradient" error. Nothing
is free, of course, and the Marquardt approach often uses more iterations when the problem is
uncomplicated. On the other hand, it is rather like a pit bull in trying to find a solution.

There is also the Deriv package, also "all in R". Both it and nlsr allow extensions to the derivatives
table, though I think most users will need to do some homework to become comfortable with doing
that.

There is also a Google Summer of Code proposal this year to wrap the Julia Automatic Differentiation
tools to R. This would allow derivatives of coded functions to be computed avoiding approximations.
I believe it will be at least partly successful in achieving its goals.

Unfortunately (and I would rather hope that someone can say eventually that I am wrong), I believe
no tool is universally applicable.

1. *If* this is homework, we do not do homework here.

2. Please read and follow the posting guide linked below to get a
useful answer. In general, we expect posters to provide code showing
their attempt to solve the problem, rather than expecting to be
provided complete solutions. See also instructions for providing a
small reproducible example.

3. Search! e.g. on the rseek.org site, inputting "AUC" gave this, among others:

Subject: [R] Syntax roccomp-using R
Message-ID: <CAJhjxo3PXhmNL=toEX8jGypWNpdRjGW7PU8QXfLzM9sFEYTFUQ@mail.gmail.com>

*Dear Bert, *

Thank you very much for your feedback and the useful link https://rseek.org/
and https://www.r-bloggers.com/calculating-auc-the-area-under-a-roc-curve/.
Actually, I want to know different performance between Stata and R, in
multilevel logistic regression. For this purposes, I replicate ".do" file
use Stata in
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153778. The
nice journal not only gives ".do" file but also ".dta" file for Stata
user. Fyi,
I succeed running my dataset accordingly approach that use in the nice
article.

In Model ii, by adding the random effects of the clusters (neighbourhoods)
only, I perform a multilevel logistic regression. Adding the neighbourhoods
a random effect considerably increase the DA of the model. If the AU-ROC
increases. This means the neighbourhoods have a relevant (observational)
General Contextual Effect on the individual outcome. That is, knowledge on
the clusters where the individuals reside is relevant for classifying
individuals. That is, for distinguishing those with from those without the
outcome. In Model iii, as expected, the AU-ROC remains similar to Model ii
after including a neighbourhoods level variable as a fixed effect. Model ii
represents the ?ceiling? of the explanatory power of the clusters. However,
particularly both syntax in the steps below, the process taking time very
long, particularly for a data set with the 130,585 observation that I have.

I trust can be replicate the syntax Stata below into the script language of
R under your advice. I want to to know the performance of R to analyse in
the syntax " roccomp".  Unfortunately, the process still not finished in
this step yet at the moment.

.  roccomp Y  r1m1p r1m2p, graph summary

. * FIGURE 3 - AU-ROC

********************************************************************************
. roccomp Y  r2m1p r2m2p, graph summary


Abbreviations
Y      = The dependent (or responding) variable
AUC    = Area Under the Curve.
AUROC  = Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
ROC    = Receiver operating characteristic
r1m1p  =  Pr(malaria)
r1m2p  = Predicted mean
r1m3p  = Predicted mean


In addition, I saw in
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auRoc/index.html, and in
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/limma/versions/3.28.14/topics/auROC
,  there is an issue regarding auROC.

Hopefully with install "CRAN - Package auRoc", I can be running the
"roccomp" used the plug-in. In addition, I can compute areas under ROC
curves using the R Commander. However, the R Commander doesn't include ROC
curves, but a Google search suggests that the RcmdrPlugin.EZR, a plug-in
package for the R Commander, includes ROC curves and may do what I want.
Isn't it?


Again thank you very much, I appreciate it.


Best wishes


Hamzah

Many thanks Jeff,

You need to pay attention to the documentation more closely. If you don't 
know what something means, that is usually a signal that you need to study 
more... in this case about the difference between an input variable and a 
design (model) matrix. This is a concept from the standard linear algebra 
formulation for regression equations. (Note that I have never used RobPer, 
nor do I regularly mess with model matrices, but I do recognize the term 
"design matrix" and used help.search("design matrix") to track this down.)

Thanks for the reprex, though it is highly irregular to intersperse 
install.packages in code that may be run more than once.

I do not provide consulting services, so you're on your own. As I said
earlier, you need to follow the posting guide and show us what efforts
you have made.
"None" will probably not succeed in getting anyone to help. Nor should
you expect anyone on this list to be familiar with Stata and/or to do
your "translation" work for you.

Hello,

I gather data from 5 objects and 5 data. frames and  would like to join
information.

join:  pb_SM + pb_T + pb_P + pb_F + pb_SJ = total_pb


join: sdmdata_SM + sdmdata_T + sdmdata_P + sdmdata_F + sdmdata_SJ

code:
rbind, merge?

total_pb<-   ??

total_sdmdata<-   ??

presvals_SM <- extract(grid_present_SM, LSM)

pb_SM <- c(rep(1, nrow(presvals_SM), rep(0, nrow(absvals_SM)))

sdmdata_SM <- data.frame(cbind(pb_SM, rbind(presvals_SM, absvals_SM))

I don't see how anyone can help you if you don't provide the input data (or a fake version of the data) you are using.

Subject: [R] Question about subset
Message-ID: <594082573.429069.1523246796179.JavaMail.zimbra@cognigencorp.com>

Hi,

The help page for subset states "subset: logical expression indicating elements or rows to keep: missing values are taken as false."

Before I try to re-invent the wheel, I would like to know if one of the base or recommended packages would contain a variant of the subset function that would consider missing values as true.

Thanks

Please read the "Details" section of the help file -- it essentially
tells you what to do by directly using indexing; e.g. for a vector,
index by:
[is.na(subset) | subset]  .

Adjust as necessary for your data structure.Or look at the code of,
e.g. subset.data.frame and create your own subset version/method by
making the trivial modification to that code.

R is open source. Sometimes it's worthwhile to take advantage of this
by making a simple modification to its code on your own before hunting
for packages.

Cheers,
Bert

Just use a Boolean expression

Subject: [R] linear regression with repeated measures
Message-ID: <CALDESV8PnY1MJQ7w0aV7YrBB8R9KFhM3A3AE_uHty2Xo3Bxw+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

this seemed to me like a very trivial question, but finally I haven't found
any similar postings with suitable solutions on the net ...
Basically, instead of regressing two simple series of measures 'a' and 'b'
(like b ~ a), I would like to use independent replicate measurements for
each variable at each level (ie, instead of having just one 'a' and one 'b'
I have independent replicates for all measures of 'a' and 'b', 'a1' could
be as well compared to 'b1' as to 'b2' etc.)
In analogy one could think of a procedure claiming to act and increase a
given output value by eg 30% (compared to not emplying this procedure).
Now I have indepedent repeated measures (since the measures themselves are
considered not very precise) for a (large) number of individuals with and
without the treatment.
Basically, I want to test the hypthesis that applying the procedure
increases values in a linear way by a given factor, thus test the
parameters of a linear regression (eg slope=1.3, offset may be different to
0). In extension to this, how could I make a confidence-interval for the
estimated slop (due to the treatment) to check if the claimed value is
indeed inside ?

# Here some toy data, my real data are much larger and might ressemble
somehow to this.
# Lines are for subjects and columns for 2 groups and repeat-measurements.
# in this case I introduce a toy-factor of 1.3 to the 2nd part of my data
(in the real data such a factor is just a hypothesis), which I would like
to investigate/confirm
dat <- matrix(rep(1:12,7)+rnorm(84),nc=7)
dat[,4:7] <- 1.3*dat[,4:7]+runif(48)
# some individual measures may be missing :
dat[2:3,4] <- NA
colnames(dat) <- paste(rep(c("a","b"),3:4),c(1:3,1:4),sep="")

# In analogy to the ample documentation of lm() :
datMean <- cbind(aM=rowMeans(dat[,1:3]),bM=rowMeans(dat[,4:7]))
(lmMean <- lm(bM ~ aM,data=as.data.frame(datMean)))
# I suppose the estimated parameters (intercet & slope) may be correct but
sice the degrees of freedom are not made of means I am convinced they are
incorrect and thus any statistics using them will be so, too ...
df.residual(lmMean)
summary(lmMean)

# I also thought about a workaround reorganizing the data into a 'simple'
two-column setup using somthing like stack() and allowing b ~ a, but again,
I suppose the degrees of freedom won't be correct neither.

# 1) should I simply correct the degrees of freedom in my lm-object, would
this be the correct number of degrees of freedom
lmMean$df.residual <- nrow(dat)*5-2
# then I suppose I would need to change the standard errors, I'm shur what
is the best way to do so

# or 2) is there a package allowing to do these steps, thus returning
correct DF, Std Err and Pr(>|t) ?

Thanks in advance,
Wolfgang Raffelsberger

Generally, statistics questions are off topic here, although they do
sometimes intersect R programming issues, as perhaps here.
Nevertheless, I believe your post would fit better on the
r-sig-mixed-models list, where repeated measures and other mixed
effects (/variance components) models are discussed. It sounds like
you may also want to do some reading about mixed effects models to
understand the issues involved, but as I found your post confusing,
maybe I'm wrong about that.

stats.stackexchange.com is another online venue for mostly statistics
discussions.

Cheers,
Bert

Your email is hard to read because you sent html email. Please send plain text.

You will need to say what you mean by "join". It's not a standard term with a universally agreed upon meaning within R.

If you have 5 data frames, each with 5 rows, and it makes sense that after joining you should have one data frame with 25 rows and the same number of columns, then rbind() is probably what you want.

If you have 5 data frames, each with 5 rows, and it makes sense that after joining you should have one data frame with 5 rows, and more columns, then merge() is probably what you want.

But some of your code suggests you have a somewhat complex data structure, so it's hard to say.

extract() is not a base R function; when asking for help one should indicate where non-base functions come from.

Subject: [R] Specifying forbidden configurations in Morris One at a Time
 (OAT) sensitivity analysis
Message-ID: <CADwXhHLsJu7EgJr3PTtwN7WvrVQQBZ8FQ_FLfA5H7i5LH_vQqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I am trying to implement the Morris One at a Time (OAT) sensitivity
analysis technique in R using the package 'sensitivity'.  The OAT and
similar other techniques in the package requires data frame X (which stores
the design or parameter combinations) to be populated by some function in
the package such as fast99 or morris. These functions take only the range
and step size of the parameters as arguments. However, in my experiment
there are few forbidden configurations. Is there a way to specify this in
the analysis set up? To be specific, is there a way to tell the model that
certain combinations are forbidden such as feeding forbidden configurations
via a text file or specifying a conditional expression which will exclude
the forbidden configurations (eg: parameter 1 < parameter 2) ?

Thanks and regards,
Reshma CC

Hello,

Though Bert's and David's answers are what you should do, note that some 
R functions that need factors will coerce their input variables when 
necessary.
Have you tried to run the code you haven't posted without coercing to 
factor? It might run...

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Fail to save an object using name as string
Message-ID: <2ad46db8-bbdf-4527-ccb9-5bd68b39fc74@yahoo.fr>

Dear list member,

I think that I have detected a strange behavior of the save() command:

 > year <- "2000"
 > assign(paste0("Var_", year), list(A=10, B=20))
 > get(paste0("Var_", year))
$A
[1] 10

$B
[1] 20

# At this point all is ok, I have created a list of name Var_2000

 > save(paste0("Var_", year), file=paste0("Var_", year, ".Rdata"))
Error in save(paste0("Var_", year), file = paste0("Var_", year, 
".Rdata")) :
 ? objet ?paste0("Var_", year)? introuvable

(introuvable=cannot be found)

but

 > save("Var_2000", file=paste0("Var_", year, ".Rdata"))

When I read the help for save: ?save

...??? the names of the objects to be saved (as symbols or character 
strings).

I checked if paste0("Var_", year) produced a character string:

 > str("Var_2000")
 ?chr "Var_2000"
 > str(paste0("Var_", year))
 ?chr "Var_2000"

The solution was to include the name in the list argument:

 > save(list=paste0("Var_", year), file=paste0("Var_", year, ".Rdata"))

But I don't understand what is the difference between "Var_2000" and 
paste0("Var_", year) as both produced the same output.

Thanks for your help,

Marc

Have you ever noticed that when you run

x <- 1:5
y <- 2:6
plot( x, y+1 )

you get the expressions you used in your call to plot on the axis labels? `x` is an expression consisting of a single symbol and y+1 is an expression consisting of the addition operator and two arguments: the symbol x and the constant 1. Plot uses these expressions in two ways: one to get numbers to plot, but also converts the expressions into strings that can be printed on the axes.

The save function has an `...` argument that it expects to find symbol names in,  and when you pass an expression as an unnamed argument instead and it then tries to convert the expression to a string and use that as a name for a variable, you get problems.... so don't do that. 

The save function also has the named argument `list` that does not have that symbol-name-extracting behaviour. By explicitly passing a vector of character strings (of length one in your case) in the named `list` argument you avoid that special handling applied by the save function to the `...` argument.

It does seem strange at first, but it goes along with some rather convenient features of the R statistical environment like formulas and intuitive plot labeling, and the ability to use

save( Var_2000, file = paste0( "Var_", year, ".Rdata" ) )

with no quotes.

I run this command for converting the numerical variable into factor. However, I get the following error message.

> cols<- c(?GrMM", "RELG", "CASTE1", "SECTOR", "SECTOR4","AGE", "MARITAL" "JOBSTATUS", "ENG", "EDU", "PARENT_EDU", "MASSMEDIA_F", "MASSMEDIA_M", "HomeComputer", "HomeInternet") for (i in cols) {data.frame[,i]= as.factor(data.frame[,i])}


Error: unexpected string constant in ?cols<- c(?GrMM", "RELG", "CASTE1", "SECTOR", "SECTOR4","AGE", "MARITAL" "JOBSTATUS""

Please help.

You are missing a comma between "MARITAL" and "JOBSTATUS".

Thank you very much.

After that I have the following error:

cols<- c("GrMM", "RELG", "CASTE1", "SECTOR", "SECTOR4","AGE", "MARITAL", "JOBSTATUS", "ENG", "EDU", "PARENT_EDU", "MASSMEDIA_F", "MASSMEDIA_M", "HomeComputer", "HomeInternet") 
> for (I in cols) {data.frame[,i]= as.factor(data.frame[,i])}


Error in sort.list(y) : 'x' must be atomic for 'sort.list'
Have you called ?sort? on a list?

The subset argument to subset is something that evaluates to logical - a vector of True or False. 
If you wanted to treat missing values _in that_ as TRUE, wrap it in an ifelse:

ifelse(is.na(condition), TRUE, condition)

where condition can be a logical or an expression evaluating to logical.

Thanks.

S. Elison provided a similar but apparently more general solution (see other post in thread).

Just use a Boolean expression 

is.na(col)|(col==0)

Not sure whether this is the problem but calling your data frame 
data.frame is not a good idea.

First, please post reproducible examples; your code will not run in anyone else's session (for example you have not shown where the data frame comes from), and if the code does not generate the error message reproducibly, noone can tell you exactly why it happens

Second, please _follow_ the posting guide and work through the suggested steps before posting a question to this list. An internet search for this error would have told you what causes it.

Finally: 
- Your loop will not work because your loop variable is I and the index is i; they are different in R. You'll just update the same column (i) lots of times, assuming i is defined.

- The error message arises from a call to factor() in as.factor(). It tells you that the column being converted is not a simple vector. That in turn tells me that you have not constructed your data frame correctly. I can't tell you what you did wrong there. 

- As another poster has said, data.frame is the name of a function - one that construicts a data frame. R can often tell which you want, but it is never safe to use the name of a function as the name of a data object. Use a different name for your data frame.

Dear all,
Is there any spectral analisys functionality available for R version 3.4.3?
Series() functionality doesn't work in this version.

Hi
You could instead of selecting columns by name select them by number

Something like
your.data[,2:3] <- do.call(data.frame, lapply(your.data[,2:3], factor))

or you could construct a vector of column numbers

x <- c(2,3)

Cheers
Petr

Thank you very much.

After that I have the following error:

cols<- c("GrMM", "RELG", "CASTE1", "SECTOR", "SECTOR4","AGE", "MARITAL", "JOBSTATUS", "ENG", "EDU", "PARENT_EDU", "MASSMEDIA_F", "MASSMEDIA_M", "HomeComputer", "HomeInternet")

Error in sort.list(y) : 'x' must be atomic for 'sort.list'
Have you called ?sort? on a list?

Message-ID: <A59963DF2FC12B49AB50D3ED683AB7BA92E67B@NT-EX01.dnsbego.de>

Dear Mr. Savicky,

I am currently working on a project where I want to test a random number generator, which is supposed to create 10.000 continuously uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1. I am now wondering if I can use the Chi-Squared-Test to solve this problem or if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test would be a better fit.

I came across one of your threads on the internet where you answer a similar question and thought I'd reach out to you.


Thanks in advance
Florian Huber

Dear Marcos,

The current Version of opensuse Linux is Leap 42.3 (when I'm still right). Probably you should upgrade your Linux system before installing one of the most recent versions of R.

Hi,

your question is nearly impossible to answer without actual testing of
your existing pipelines.  But from my soon 20-year usage of R, it's
clear to me that the R Core Team strives to keep things backward
compatible as far as they can.  The NEWS file:

  https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html

contains useful information on what's been updated in each release -
you can inspect that one from your own perspective.  There are also
12,000 packages on CRAN that are tested on old-release, current
release, and developers version of R.  Many of these packages rarely
gets updated, which indicates that these package work across a large
number of R versions (and platforms).

FYI, R 3.5.0 is being released on April 23, 2018.  You should aim to
install that version.   Also, on Linux it's not too hard to install
multiple R versions in parallel when you install from source.  Then
you can go back and forth between version whenever you'd like.

/Henrik

Hi Albrecht, thanks for your return.

I'm  using the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64) PATCHLEVEL = 4 and not the openSUSE. Do you know if exist a compatibility list of R and Linux version? In the site
https://cran.r-project.org is informed only about the R version 3.4.4 for SLE12 but not about the previous versions. I can't upgrade for SLE12 and I would like know what is the last version that I can use of R in my SUSE version.

Best regards.

Marcos Fiorini

The reason people like to pay companies for their commercial or "enterprise" operating system distributions is because the someone you pay can do all the legwork to confirm compatibility. You should be asking your commercial distro provider to render this service. If they deem it too far below their radar to help you with then you need to identify which open distro is similar enough to your commercial environment to piggyback OS packages from, or go to the source and start compiling and installing required supporting software, which may extend to installing the necessary compiler to build R. The version of Linux itself is unlikely to prevent this last option from working.

R-Help

I am attempting to create a series of bivariate normal distributions.  So using the mvtnorm library I have created the following code ...

# Standard deviations and correlation
sig_x <- 1
sig_y <- 1
rho_xy <- 0.0

# Covariance between X and Y
sig_xy <- rho_xy * sig_x *sig_y

# Covariance matrix
Sigma_xy <- matrix(c(sig_x ^ 2, sig_xy, sig_xy, sig_y ^ 2), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

# Load the mvtnorm package
library("mvtnorm")

# Means
mu_x <- 0
mu_y <- 0

# Simulate 1000 observations
set.seed(12345)  # for reproducibility
xy_vals <- rmvnorm(1000, mean = c(mu_x, mu_y), sigma = Sigma_xy) 

# Have a look at the first observations
head(xy_vals)

# Create scatterplot
plot(xy_vals[, 1], xy_vals[, 2], pch = 16, cex = 2, col = "blue", 
     main = "Bivariate normal: rho = 0.0", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")

# Add lines
abline(h = mu_y, v = mu_x)

Problem is this results in sigma(x) = sigma(y), rho=0 and I need or what 2sigma(x)=sigma(y), rho=0 or 2sigma(y)=sigma(x), rho=0 to elongate the distribution.  What I have created creates a circle.  Can I do that within the mvtnorm package?

Er, yes ... that is what you asked for.

Have you tried rho_xy=0.7 or similar in the code above?

Figures 3.8, 3.9, 3.10

The code for these figures is available in the HH package

install.packages("HH")
library(HH)

Subject: [R] WGCNA package installation segmentation fault
Message-ID: <CA+hbrhVg+dZ6SAHBUhjw3x6hPZzt9pxdTuiPpXQ5-yMx-nM8Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

a user contacted me about a segfault when installing WGCNA package
dowloaded from CRAN. I also see a segfault like that on certain
installs of R.

The package passes all CRAN checks, so presumably this has something
to do with the R installation or environment. The R versions here are
not the newest but I would guess that this is not an R version issue.

I'm attaching two sessionInfo() outputs on systems where the
installation throws a segfault.

Any pointers/ideas as to what could be going wrong?

Thanks,

Peter

 I get the seg-fault on exiting R after loading WGCNA into R-3.4.3 on
Linux.  Valdgrind
shows the problem occurs when tearing down an Rstreambuf object:

*
*  Package WGCNA 1.63 loaded.
*
*    Important note: It appears that your system supports multi-threading,
*    but it is not enabled within WGCNA in R.
*    To allow multi-threading within WGCNA with all available cores, use
*
*          allowWGCNAThreads()
*
*    within R. Use disableWGCNAThreads() to disable threading if necessary.
*    Alternatively, set the following environment variable on your system:
*
*          ALLOW_WGCNA_THREADS=<number_of_processors>
*
*    for example
*
*          ALLOW_WGCNA_THREADS=12
*
*    To set the environment variable in linux bash shell, type
*
*           export ALLOW_WGCNA_THREADS=12
*
*     before running R. Other operating systems or shells will
*     have a similar command to achieve the same aim.

Hello All,


I'm struggling to solve this ODE using R,


vdpol <- function (h, v, t) (
          list(c (
            -0.1*v/(pi*(2*10*h-h^2)),
              (v = (-0.1*v/(pi*(2*10*h-h^2))^2) + 2*9.81*h))

                  ))
          library(deSolve)
          yini <- (c(h = 20, v=0))
          nonstiff <- ode(y = yini, func = vdpol,
                          times= seq(0, 30, by = 0.01),
                                     parms = 1)

It says that


 The number of derivatives returned by func() (4) must equal the length of the initial conditions vector (2)


I'm not sure how when i only have two derivates in the equation. I have little to no knowledge of R and I'm following guidance of the internet so any help is appreciated.


Kind Regards,


H

Hello,

Writing to seek help in regard to some unexpected performance anomaly i am
observing in using tsoutlers:tso on the mac vs on an AWS cloud server..


I am running the following code with very small dataset of about 208
records.

d.dir <- '/Users/darshanpandya/xxxxxx'

d.input <- fread(file.path(paste0(d.dir,"/zzz/"),FNAME,fsep =

ts.var <- ts(inputData[,1], frequency = tsFrequency)
ts_outlier <- tso(ts.var, types =

This piece of code runs in about 60 seconds on my laptop but take about
upward of 13 mins on a decent AWS node with nothing else running on it.

Any hints as to why this is happening is greatly appreciated.

Hi R users,
I need to run a analysis using a data for each folder. I do have several
folders. Each folder contains several files but these files name are
similar to the files that is saved into  another folders.  I need to repeat
the analysis for every folder and would like to save the output in that
particular folder.  After completing the analysis in one folder, I want to
move another folder. Basically I was doing manually (repeating the analysis
each and every folder manually). Is there any way to make a loop so that I
can run the analysis for different folders? Is there any example code?

Thanks for your help.

Hi Marna,
Assuming that you are descending into different subdirectories from
the same directory:

directories<-c("dir1","dir2","dir3")
for(directory in directories) {
 setwd(directory)
 # do whatever you want to do
 # then return to the directory above
 setwd("..")
}

This will allow you to start and finish in the same directory.

Jim

Maybe this assumption is not needed.
Since setwd returns the current directory, it is safer to assign that 
value to a variable and in the end use it reset the original state.

Using your code,

directories<-c("dir1","dir2","dir3")
for(directory in directories) {
    old_dir <- setwd(directory)
    # do whatever you want to do
    # then return to the original directory
    setwd(old_dir)
}


Hope this helps,

You can record the time to evaluate each line by wrapping each line in a
call to system.time().  E.g.,

expressions <- quote({
    # paste your commands here, or put them into a file and use exprs <-
parse("thatFile")
    d.dir <- '/Users/darshanpandya/xxxxxx'
FNAME <- 'my_data.csv'

d.input <- fread(file.path(paste0(d.dir,"/zzz/"),FNAME,fsep =
.Platform$file.sep), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, showProgress
= TRUE) %>% as.data.frame
  # ... the rest of your lines
})
expressions <- as.list(expressions)[-1]

timedExpressions <- lapply(expressions,
function(expr)bquote(system.time(.(expr))))

source(exprs=timedExpressions, echo=TRUE)

See which line (or lines) show big time differences on the two platforms.

Subject: [R] Reading xpt files into R
Message-ID: <1907640263.304232.1523638916808@mail2.virginmedia.com>

Hello R folk

I have an xpt file which I have been trying to open into R in R studio

On the net I found guidance which says that I need packages Hmisc and SASxport which I have successfully loaded.

I had also found some code which says that this would allow me to read the xpt file into R:

library(SASxport)
data(Alfalfa)
lookup.xport("test.xpt")
Alfalfa<-read.xport("test.xpt")

I have set the directory correctly as far as I am aware, but when I tried to run this code I got the following error messages:

> lookup.xport("test.xpt")
Error in lookup.xport.inner(file) : file not in SAS transfer format
> Alfalfa<-read.xport("test.xpt")
Error in read.xport("test.xpt") : 
The specified file does not start with a SAS xport file header!

I neither know what the file being not in SAS transfer format means, nor what not starting with an SAS xport file header means either...
If anyone can explain how I can read this xpt file into R I'd be v grateful

Thanks Nick Wray

I'm working in my first large database (53,098,492,383 records).  When I
select the db via something like

 

Library(SparkR)

mydata <- sql("SELECT * FROM <table name>")

 

is "mydata" a SparkDataFrame,  and do I work with SparkDataFrames like I
would regular df (per say); because I can't image I would ever create a 53
billion record df.  I'm starting to acquaint myself with e SparkR package,
but I get confuse because it appears df and SparkDtaFrame are use
interchangeable. Or maybe not.

 

Looking for a good intro to SparkDataFrame.

The "export" or "transfer format from SA is supposed to make reading data less difficult and standardized. This is what a header from the version used by the NHANES releases (that's all one line):

You can look at the file with a text editor.

There is a read.xport function in the foreign package and I think most people would have chosen that one as a first attemp. It's part of the standard R distribution. It refers you to https://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts140.pdf for details on the format.

Subject: [R] cvTools for 2 models not working

Dear R-experts,

I am trying to do cross-validation for different models using the cvTools package.

I can't get the CV for the "FastTau" and "hbrfit". I guess I have to write my own functions at least for hbrfit. What is going wrong with FastTau ?

Here below the reproducible example. It is a simple toy example (not my real dataset) with many warnings, what is important to me are the errors.

Subject: [R] Extracting specified pages from a lattice ("trellis") object.
Message-ID: <bacf5203-e07c-7944-9935-5e5c18b9fa06@auckland.ac.nz>


Suppose that (e.g.) xyplot() returns an object "xxx" with (say) 3 pages.
I would like to extract/plot (print) just one of these pages, e.g.
page 2.

Here's a toy example:

x   <- rep(seq(0,1,length=11),12)
set.seed(42)
y   <- rnorm(3*44)
a   <- rep(letters[1:12],each=11)
dta <- data.frame(x=x,y=y,a=a)
xxx <- xyplot(y~x|a,data=dta,layout=c(2,2))

I would to extract from xxx and print page 2 (the page corresponding to
levels e, f, g and h).

Is there any (simple) way that I can do this?

I've mucked around with update.trellis() and [.trellis, but I cannot 
make head nor tail of the documentation.  The [.trellis method seems to 
work in some situations, but not in others, and since I cannot 
understand what it actually does, I cannot figure out why.

E.g. in my toy example "xxx[5:8]" seems to give me what I want, but in 
the context of my real application a similar construction does not work.

Thanks for any insight.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Subject: [R] Efficient way to subset rows in R for dataset with 10^7 columns
Message-ID: <CADbGCVhRXpR5Wgkd6voTrTaUOytuOhqLiN3fWScejP4bVCXgtg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a data.table with dimensions 100 by 10^7.

When I do

    trainIndex <-
      caret::createDataPartition(
        df$status,
        p = .9,
        list = FALSE,
        times = 1
      )
    outerTrain <- df[trainIndex]
    outerTest  <- df[-trainIndex]

Subsetting the rows of df takes over 20 minutes.

What is the best way to efficiently subset this?

Thanks!

You have 10^7 columns? That process is bound to be slow.

Oh, there are ways, but the constraining issue here is moving data (memory bandwidth), and data table is probably already the fastest mechanism for doing that. If you have a computer with four or more real cores you can try setting up a subset of the columns in each task and cbind the results afterward, but it will be hard to accomplish without making extra copies of the data. You are already probably already using virtual memory which is saved to and from hard disk storage as needed. 

Working in Spark with a distributed file system like Hadoop might solve some of these problems... but I haven't done real work with such tools.

That's what he tried, but the bottom line is that just because something is called foo.xpt there is no guarantee that it actually is a SAS XPORT file. Firefox plugins use the same extension but it could really be anything - naming conventions are just that: conventions.

So dig deeper and find out what the file really is (or was supposed to be).

Well yesterday I'd downloaded the "foreign" package and tried to open the xpt file using that:

library(foreign)
read.xport("test.xpt")

I got the following error and warning messages:

> read.xport("test.xpt")
Error in read.xport("test.xpt") : 
The specified file does not start with a SAS xport file header!
In addition: Warning message:
In readBin(file, what = character(0), n = 1, size = nchar(xport.file.header,  :
null terminator not found: breaking string at 10000 bytes

I can open the xpt using wordpad and there is a header but it seems to be just text.  I really don't know what constitutes an "
SAS xport file header"

Does read.xport read both version 5 and version 8 xpt files?  This link to
the Library of Congress can get you started on how to interpret the
header.  (It states that Version 8 was introduced in 2012 but was not in
wide use as of early 2017.)

I'm not sure why Peter deleted my copy of a sample of a SAS xport header that I took from an NHANES data distribution. He seemed to think I was confused about the function you had been using. The reason I mentioned that `read.xport` was from the 'foreign' package is that one generally loads that package to make the function available, while it appears you were using a different package, SASxport, and I didn't know whether that package had a function which had the same name as the one from pkg-foreign, and if it did whether it might depend on the read.xport function in foreign. You should not need to download the 'foreign' package, since it ships with every distribution of R. These are the arguments accepted by that function:

SASxport::read.xport
function (file, force.integer = TRUE, formats = NULL, name.chars = NULL, 
    names.tolower = FALSE, keep = NULL, drop = NULL, as.is = 0.95, 
    verbose = FALSE, as.list = FALSE, include.formats = FALSE) 


 When I look at the SASxport::read.xport function code, it is in fact, _not_ the same function. But it does have the R statement about what it thinks qualifies as a SAS xprot file:

xport.file.header <- "HEADER RECORD*******LIBRARY HEADER RECORD!!!!!!!000000000000000000000000000000  "

It checks to see whether the file starts with that string.

This is what appeared in my first message:

So the header is text, but it is text with a particular structure. If your file doesn't have that structure, then it's not a SAS xport file. The .xpt extension is also used for Mozilla Firefox plugins.

Actually not, Peter. Wray was using a function of the same name, but not from pkg-foreign. Perhaps he was following the tutorial at:

http://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Open_XPT_File_with_R

Peter and I agree agree on that advice.

Version 8 SAS xport files have the header
  HEADER RECORD*******LIBV8 HEADER RECORD!!!!!!!000000000000000000000
000000000
It is easy to check for that in your text editor or in R.

Subject: [R] about family=binomial in glm funtion
Message-ID: <CAN_1JwS5_AnEUuPFd05RJtwAwfiBs_S4SLNYsf0O7koENKQtag@mail.gmail.com>

Hei,
  I just wonder the use of family=binomial in glm function.
  As I learned from book (e.g. Andy Field) that logistic regression (binary
logit) can use glm funtion with family = binomial. Here the y is a factor
variable (e.g. value = 1 or 2).

 But I have also seen i many other cases, same function glm with
family=binomial, but y is a variable with several column , like y=
cbind(y1, y2), and here y1  and y2 are the success number, failure number
respectively.


What is the difference between these cases ? For my opinion the first one
is a logit model, and second one is a binomial probability model , right?

Many thanks.

What I'd suggest is that you read the documentation.  In this case ?glm 
doesn't give the answer, but it links to ?family, which does.

Subject: [R] RQDA/RGtk2 Installation Problem
Message-ID: <CAGJtK3QD6xrkxbjcxKKWO5CcMSUVgNSYdMPjOx359mcRm_htzw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have been having a problem installing RQDA on my Mac (OS 10.13.2). I
followed the installation process on the RQDA page (
http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/), but I keep getting an error message
saying that I am missing pkg-config and GTK. I reinstalled XQuartz and GTK+
2.24.17 multiple times (and reinstalled R version 3.4.4), but kept
receiving the same error message. I also tried to install RGtk2 from
MacPort, but got the same error messages. I am posting the log below, in
hope it will help someone to see the problem/solution.

In my Googling for solution, I saw some other people posting the same
problem, but have not seen a solution. I'd appreciate if anyone could help
me to fix this. I really would love to be able to use RQDA!

Thanks in advance for your help.

Ryoko

That may have messed things up if it modified your PATH environment settings. You should notice that the instructions on the http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/ page are to install the GTK+ binary from http://r.research.att.com/

So you are on a Mac. There's a special mailing list for us. Have you installed Xcode and the CLT?

You will need to read and foolw the advice at the top of the following page:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Have you searched StackOverflow? I found teh following answer there. (I think it's a bit incomplete since you should have the system variables set according to the Tools page, so I editted that answer.) But this looked like a starting point ... after setting environment variables and getting the Fortran compileras per above

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19645590/running-rattle-on-mac-os-x-10-9-mavericks/19719518#19719518

Do not reply to this mailing list (or to just me); rather send it to the R-SIG-Mac mailing list (after subscribing and reading the Posting Guide which it appears you have not done.)

 *Dear Bert, *

Thank you very much for your feedback and the useful link https://rseek.org/
and https://www.r-bloggers.com/calculating-auc-the-area-under-a-roc-curve/.
Actually, I want to know different performance between Stata and R, in
multilevel logistic regression. For this purposes, I replicate ".do" file
use Stata in
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153778. The
nice journal not only gives ".do" file but also ".dta" file for Stata
user. Fyi,
I succeed running my dataset accordingly approach that use in the nice
article.

In Model ii, by adding the random effects of the clusters (neighbourhoods)
only, I perform a multilevel logistic regression. Adding the neighbourhoods
a random effect considerably increase the DA of the model. If the AU-ROC
increases. This means the neighbourhoods have a relevant (observational)
General Contextual Effect on the individual outcome. That is, knowledge on
the clusters where the individuals reside is relevant for classifying
individuals. That is, for distinguishing those with from those without the
outcome. In Model iii, as expected, the AU-ROC remains similar to Model ii
after including a neighbourhoods level variable as a fixed effect. Model ii
represents the ?ceiling? of the explanatory power of the clusters. However,
particularly both syntax in the steps below, the process taking time very
long, particularly for a data set with the 130,585 observation that I have.

I trust can be replicate the syntax Stata below into the script language of
R under your advice. I want to to know the performance of R to analyse in
the syntax " roccomp".? Unfortunately, the process still not finished in
this step yet at the moment.

Abbreviations
Y? ? ? = The dependent (or responding) variable
AUC? ? = Area Under the Curve.
AUROC? = Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
ROC? ? = Receiver operating characteristic
r1m1p? =? Pr(malaria)
r1m2p? = Predicted mean
r1m3p? = Predicted mean


In addition, I saw in
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auRoc/index.html, and in
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/limma/versions/3.28.14/topics/auROC
,? there is an issue regarding auROC.

Hopefully with install "CRAN - Package auRoc", I can be running the
"roccomp" used the plug-in. In addition, I can compute areas under ROC
curves using the R Commander. However, the R Commander doesn't include ROC
curves, but a Google search suggests that the RcmdrPlugin.EZR, a plug-in
package for the R Commander, includes ROC curves and may do what I want.
Isn't it?


Again thank you very much, I appreciate it.


Best wishes


Hamzah

If nothing else, I think you need to supply some sample data that includes examples of the "forbidden configurations"
See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example

 Hi!

I am trying to implement the Morris One at a Time (OAT) sensitivity
analysis technique in R using the package 'sensitivity'.? The OAT and
similar other techniques in the package requires data frame X (which stores
the design or parameter combinations) to be populated by some function in
the package such as fast99 or morris. These functions take only the range
and step size of the parameters as arguments. However, in my experiment
there are few forbidden configurations. Is there a way to specify this in
the analysis set up? To be specific, is there a way to tell the model that
certain combinations are forbidden such as feeding forbidden configurations
via a text file or specifying a conditional expression which will exclude
the forbidden configurations (eg: parameter 1 < parameter 2) ?

Thanks and regards,
Reshma CC

Subject: [R] Adding a new conditional column to a list of dataframes
Message-ID: <DB5PR02MB0904F0F0DA05B29EC41A258D80B10@DB5PR02MB0904.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>


Hi all ..,


I have a list of 7000 dataframes with similar column headers and I wanted to add a new column to each dataframe based on a certain condition which is the same for all dataframes.


When I extract one dataframe and apply my code it works very well as follows :-


First suppose this is my first dataframe in the list

> OneDF <- Mylist[[1]]

> OneDF


ID       Pdate                  Tdate

1         2010-09-30       2011-05-10

2         2011-11-07       2009-09-31

3         2012-01-05        2008-06-23


To add a new column where "C" has to be written in that column only if the date in

"Tdate" column is less than the first date(row) in "Pdate" column.Otherwise "NA" is written.

I have written this code to do so :-


OneDF$NewCol [ OneDF[ ,3] <  OneDF[ 1,2] ] <- "C"


This gave me what I want as follows :-


ID       Pdate                  Tdate                      NewCol

1         2010-09-30       2011-05-10                NA

2         2011-11-07       2009-09-31                  C

3         2012-01-05        2008-06-23                 C


However, when I tried to apply this code in a function and then apply this function

to all dataframes using lapply() function , I do not get what I want.


I wrote this function first :-


MyFunction <- function(x) x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C"


Then I wrote this code to apply my function to all dataframes in "Mylist" :


NewList <- lapply(names(Mylist), function(x) MyFunction(Mylist[[x]]))


This returned a list of 7000 elements and each of which contain "C'' letter. Each

dataframe has become a vector of "C'' letter which is totally away from what I need.

 I expected to see a list of my 7000 dataframes and each of which looks like the output

I have shown above with the new column.


I spent a lot of time trying to know what  is the mistake I have made in these last two codes

but was not able to know the issue.


Could you please let me know my mistake and how to correct my syntax ?


Kind Regards

Allaisone

Your function should return x after modifying it.  As it is, it returns 
the value of x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C", which is "C".  So 
change it to

MyFunction <- function(x) {
   x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C"
   x
}

Your failure to send your question using plain text format means that the mailing list tried to fix that and we are seeing your code all messed up. Please learn how to use your email program... or we may not even be able to figure out your question at all. 

I think you need to pay attention to what your function is returning... whatever is on the last line of the function is key. Try testing your function separately from the lapply to insure you get what you want. Also be sure to use braces when they are needed to define your function.

A function returns the result of the last function call. In your case the last function called was `[<-` and if you look at that function's help page you will find only the value of its RHS (in your case "C") is returned. That assignment function has is predominat action via side-effect rather than by a truly functional operation.. The function might have been written:

 MyFunction <- function(x) { x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C"; x } # so that x gets returned

I say "might" since you have not included a reproducible example.

Another point: The `$` operator is not ideal for work within functions.

Can you explain more what you plan to do and give an example of what you 
have tried to do until now to do a "break down point" in R. Perhaps a 
"break down point" is common in your field, but I have no idea about 
what it is !

Depends how desperate you are for processing speed and careful you have been with optimizing your own algorithms. The default build of R is IMO quite usable for many people, and without a doubt many complaints about its speed are misdirected and are instead due to poor handling of working memory by the user. Such problems usually dwarf the benefit of having an optimized math library.

Hello everybody,
I have encountered a problem with the inverse Gaussian distribution. It is very likely that it will not work regardless of the data input. I have programmed this regression and it works fine no matter which distribution the response comes from.
If you run this example (first tried and already got the error)
set.seed(1234)
y = abs( rnorm(150) )
glm( y ~ ., iris, family = inverse.gaussian(log) )
You will get this message: 

Error: inner loop 1; cannot correct step size
In addition: Warning message:
step size truncated due to divergence 
?Whom should I talk to about fixing this bug, in some next update of R?

Subject: [R] Help with R-Calling forth csv.
Message-ID: <5ad47997.1c69fb81.3b067.2f64@mx.google.com>

Hi, I'm working on R trying to find a distribution that fits data from a csv file. The csv contains data on pressure exerted by a certain vehicle in terms of pressure [kPa] and I have around 3000 data points. 

I want to call forth this csv and by using (fitdistr) or if you could recommend a function to use, get a plot of my csv and the distributions I can compare it to (Weibull, chi, beta, etc). Now im a complete amateur with the program R, and I can't write a code to call forth the csv with every data point. I?ve been stuck trying to write a code that works for over a week and have not gotten it to work. I've come to the conclusion that this is the only program capable enough to help me plot the distributions to my data, any help is greatly appreciated!

Kind regards

Dear Mohammad

Perhaps if you showed us what you tried people could offer more helpful 
advice? When you say you want to call it forth do you mean you want to 
read in the file using read.csv?

There are plenty of options for reading csv files. For built-in solutions
look at ?read.csv or at read_csv from the package reader.

If the measurements are ordered in columns rather than in rows, reading the
data can be very slow.

Hi, I do not know how to post in general again, however my csv contains
around 5-250k data Points depending on vehicle/road type and pressure
exerted on geotechnical structures. I have used R to develope histograms of
said csv files and will attach such Picture to you in this mail and the csv
used. Below I will type the R code I have used for this histogram.

------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

tryck <- read.csv("radmanso_2017.csv", sep=";", dec=",")

##### H??R KOLLAR VI ALLA DATA PUNKTER ######

ggplot(data=tryck, aes(tryck[,1])) +

  geom_histogram(aes(y =..density..),

                 breaks=seq(min(tryck[,1]-1), max(tryck[,1]+1), by = 0.5),

                 col="black",

                 fill="green",

                 alpha = .2) +

  geom_density(col=2) +

  labs(title="Pressure for r?dmans?") +

  labs(x="Pressure [kPa]", y="Amount of vehicles (Percentage)")+

  stat_function(fun=dnorm, colour="blue", args = list(mean =
mean(tryck[,1]), sd = sd(tryck[,1])))



My problem now is to find a statistical distribution that corresponds well
with my histograms with the use of Visual aids, cumulative distributions or
goodness of fit tests which I can?t develope a code for as my csv wont get
called forth and I do not know how to proceed from that Point on to develop
such an aid. If you have any input on how to read the csv file and call
forth a distribution to try on my data points such as Weibull, beta, chi or
gen. Extreme value distributions I would much appreciate the help!



Kind regards,

Mohammad

Message-ID: <A86C6438FB909A409DDEF926277952B6A78077@PPWEXCH2KX14.coh.org>

Hi All..,

I need to do the following repetitive jobs:

seg71 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen71/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg71$id <-"sn71"

seg72 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen72/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg72$id <-"sn72"

seg73 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen73/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg73$id <-"sn73"

seg74 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen74/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg74$id <-"sn74"

seg75 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen75/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg75$id <-"sn75"

seg <- rbind (seg71, seg72, seg73, seg74, seg75)

I want to write a loop to do it;

For ( d in 71:75) {
  Dir<-paste("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen", i, sep="")
  setwd(Dir)
..........
then I do not know how to create objects seg71 to seg75;  in SAS, it would be  seg&d    ;

I like R, but not good at R.

Can you help me?

Thank you,

Ding

Hello,

The following might do it. Without data it's untested.


wd <- function(i){
     paste0("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen7", i, 
"/seg.pr3.csv")
}

seg <- lapply(1:5, function(i) {
     DF <-read.csv(wd(i))
     DF$id <- paste0("sn7", i)
     DF
})

seg <- do.call(rbind, seg)
row.names(seg) <- NULL


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi Mohammad,
The plot you attached suggests that the underlying distribution may be
a mixture. Is there anything in your data that would explain this,
such as laden/unladen, uphill/downhill, different road surface?

Hi!

An alternative with 'assign':

for ( i in 71:75) {
? setwd(paste("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen", i,
sep=""))
? temp.df<-read.csv("seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
? temp.df$id<-paste0("sn",i,sep="")
? assign(paste0("seg",i,sep=""),temp.df)
}
rm(temp.df,i) ? ?# Clean up

HTH,
Kimmo

Hi all,

I would like to set up an iterative read & write sequence to avoid 
reading and writing each file one at a time.
Hundreds of data sets to re-calculate.? The code I have works well 
individually, but would like to set up an iterative read, calculate and 
write changing the input and output file names each iteration.

I? think I have read that there is an R? feature using "Pipes" and % 
that may help but have not figured out how to do this.
What I am seeking is a way to read a list of TXT files, calculate the 
values and write the results in an iterative manner to avoid manually 
reading each file individually

Suggestions?

Tnx,
Bruce*

Suggestions?

Yes. Don't do this.

Instead, wrap your code in a function, use lapply() to apply it over your
list of files, returning all results in one list, and then save the list in
an .rdata file.

Also, in future, please post in plain text, as html tends to get mangled on
this plain text list .

Dear Bruce,

I'd write a function that take filenames as arguments. It should read
the file, do the calculations and write that output to another file
which can be calculated from the input. You can get all input files in
a directory with e.g. list.files(). Then you can simply loop over the
inputs. Here is some pseudo code.

my_summary <- function(input) {
   raw <- read.table(input)
   summarised <- summary(raw)
   output <- calculate_output(input)
   write.csv(summarised, output)
}
inputs <- list.files("raw/data/path")
sapply(inputs, my_summary)

Likely a spammer has joined the mailing list and is auto-replying to posts made to the list. Unlikely that the list itself has been "hacked". Agree that it is obnoxious.

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone might be able to provide some advice with an nMDS / R problem. I'm trying to run nMDS on a dataset that contains many missing values and was wondering how I can account for the missing values when running nMDS? It seems as though the data are being grouped depending on where the zero values appear. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.

Apologies if this message isn't relevant to you.

Kind regards,

Jessie

Subject: [R] Time intervals in a datframe
Message-ID: <DB5PR02MB090427691DC9588C30B49EC180B70@DB5PR02MB0904.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>


Hi all

I have a list of multiple datframes with the same column headers. The last column in each datframe contains a vector of "Interval" class after I have produced this column using "lubridate" package. I needed to convert my list of dataframes to be in a single dataframe for further analysis. I did this using the following syntax :

SingleDataframe <- ldply (MylistofDFs,data.frame)

The problem is that after this conversion, the the column with time intervals has been converted into numeric type with number of seconds during the time interval instead of the interval itself as follows :

The column Before conversion looks like this:

TimeInterval (class 'interval')
2012-12-13 UTC--2016-02-16 UTC

but after conversion the list into dataframe,
This column becomes number of seconds as follows :

TimeInterval (class : numeric)
100224000

Is there any method to convert my list into a a single dataframe without affecting the types of
vectors in my dataframes?. i.e. I want to keep the interval column as it with avoidance its conversion into numeric when I convert my list of dataframes into a single dataframe... Or at least keep the same format of the interval even if this has been changed to "character" type vector even though I prefer to be in "interval" class.

Any suggestions would be very appreciated.

Regards

It also seems that this does not happen to everyone.

I am not sure how you can automatically block the spammers.

Sorry I cannot be of more help."

I got some spam emails after my last post to the list, and the emails
did not seem to go through r-help. The spammers may be subscribed to
the r-help, or they get the poster emails from some of the web copies
of this list (nabble or similar).

Subject: [R] nMDS with R: missing values
Message-ID: <203BAAFF-AE4E-4E66-ACC9-69521B9F0380@plymouth.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone might be able to provide some advice with an nMDS / R problem. I?m trying to run nMDS on a dataset that contains many missing values and was wondering how I can account for the missing values when running nMDS? It seems as though the data are being grouped depending on where the zero values appear. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.

Apologies if this message isn?t relevant to you.

Kind regards,

Jessie

Hi! 

This happened to me also! I just got a spam email just after posting and then in following days I got obnoxious spam emails in my spam filter. As the others, I think that there is some kind of bot subscribed to the list, but also perhaps a spider or crawler monitoring the R-Help archive and getting email addresses there. Nabble is a possibility too.

Just an observation. I have not seen the spam you are discussing. Possibly it is specific to gmail addresses?

I think you will have to provide some more information. What function/package are you using for nMDS (eg. isoMDS in MASS, monoMDS in vegan)? What function/package are you using to compute your distance/dissimilarities (eg. dist in stats, vegdist in vegan)? 

Zero represents absence. It is not a missing value, so that part of your question is not clear.

The dist() function computes distance ignoring missing values if they are properly represented as NAs in the data. The vegdist() function does this if na.rm=TRUE. 

The results will be affected by how much data is missing. It would be useful to know if the missing values are concentrated in particular rows or columns so that eliminating a few rows and columns could substantially reduce the percentage of missing values.

There is no base R class called "interval". Perhaps lubridate has not provided you with an `ldply( . ,data.frame)`-accessible method for concatenation. You should construct an example that starts with the loading code for whatever package(s) are being used.

Many thank David ..,


Yes , correct, the class "interval" is a special class belongs to the package "lubridate" and
is not a base R class.

I have just found a solution and happy to share it :-

using an alternative conversion method with the use of "rbind" instead of
"ldplyr " method will keep the converted dataframe with the same "interval' class as follows :-

MySingleDF <- do.call("rbind",MyList)

Regards

It's happened 3 or 4 times for me, only on the R list. It only happens
when answering certain questions and I think all responders to that
question may get it. Seems to have nothing to do with the OP. I just
block the email address.

Hi!

Not just an gmail issue. After my last reply I have gotten tons of
spams from "Samantha Smith". Keep hitting my "rank as spam"-button in
the hope that my MUA could learn :)

Best,
Kimmo

I don?t think that it?s a just a gmail issue. If some of you aren?t receiving those emails is probably because they get caught in your organization spam filter and they don?t reach you. 

Every time I write to the list I receive those messages.

Thank you Peter (and Ulrich and ..),

>From all the cases we (R-help-owner = your friendly volunteer
list moderators) checked,

1) the address from which the spam was sent  was *NOT* among the
   13'000 subscriber addresses to R-help

2) in one case, I replied to the address stating that it
   seemed that *e-mail account* had been hacked.
   The result was nil (NULL), i.e., my conclusion was

   a) the address was a really registered/existing e-mail address that gave
      no "mailer daemon" error 

   b) it probably did go to the spammers: a legitimate user
      would have replied to me.

Subject: [R] Event-triggered change in value with a time-delay
Message-ID: <CAE6OfuqDuKZ+7yey3LLa7a+LSxv3HwO2ZaMR___G4h5YM+L=Pg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am solving a set of ODEs using deSolve and have run into a problem I
would appreciate some advice on. One of the parameters (m) in the ODEs
changes between two states when one of the variables (D) crosses a
threshold (D_T) for the first time in either direction. Additionally, when
the variable crosses the threshold (either by increasing or decreasing),
there is a time delay (delay) before the parameter shifts values.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Toy model:
# define parameters
P <- c(m = 10,
       R_1 = 0.5,
       R_2 = 0.1,
       D_0 = 50,
       D_T = 5,
       delay = 3
)
# set initial values
y_0 <- c(D = 0, Y = 1)

# set timesteps
times <- seq(0, 100, length = 101)

# define function
bit <- function(t,y,parms){
  with(as.list(c(parms,y)),{


    # How I would implement the change if there was no time delay
    # m <- ifelse(D>=D_T, m*.68, m)

    # Option 1: nested if statements with time delay
    # if (D >= D_T) {
    #   t_start1 <- t + delay
    #   if (t >= t_start1){
    #     m <- 6.8
    #   }
    # }
    # if (D < D_T) {
    #   t_start2<- t + delay
    #   if (t >= t_start2){
    #     m <- 10
    #   }
    # }


    dD <- D_0 * (R_1 / (R_1 - R_2)) * (-R_2 * exp(-R_2 * t) + R_1 *
exp(-R_1 * t))
    dY <- Y + m;
    res <- c(dD, dY)
    list(res, m = m)
  })
}


# Solve model
library(deSolve)
out <- ode(y = y_0, times = times, func = bit, parms = P)
out.df <- as.data.frame(out)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have come up with a number of ideas, but I either haven't been able to
get them to work or don't know if R has a command for it:

1. Nested "if" statements with something to track time (as shown above).
One issue here is* t-start *is redefined with each time step in the ode
solver so *t* never reaches *t_start +delay*.

2. Event triggered changes. From the examples I have found (link
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/vignettes/deSolve.pdf> p.
24-25), the time at which the event happens is either pre-set or occurs at
a root of the ODE.  Also- would this strategy require multiple events? One
event in which the variable crossing the threshold triggers a timer,
another for the timer triggering the parameter change?

3. Lagvalue. This might take care of the time lag component, but I am still
struggling to understand (1) how lagvalue works and (2) how to integrate
both the threshold and timer components.

   if ( D < D_T )
     m<- ifelse(lagvalue(t-delay)<=0, 6.8, 10)
   end

4. Sigmoidal function. Someone suggested this to me earlier, but I am not
sure how this would work. Is it possible to have a sigmoidal function that
switches repeatedly between two states (as opposed to the characteristic S
curve that transitions once from one state to another)?

5. Mathmematica has a WhenEvent function- is there something similar in R?


Thank you for your time and any tips you might have!

Seems it must be the R-list. A horde of ?solicitation? emails began arriving about 27 minutes after I posted about not seeing any! Had left work by that time, so did not encounter them until now.

Hi!

This happened to me also! I just got a spam email just after posting and then in following days I got obnoxious spam emails in my spam filter. As the others, I think that there is some kind of bot subscribed to the list, but also perhaps a spider or crawler monitoring the R-Help archive and getting email addresses there. Nabble is a possibility too.

Dear All,

Here is a reprex:

> x<- 1:100
> x[-which(x>100)]
integer(0)

In words, I am finding out which indices correspond to values in x which
are  greater than  100 ( there are no such items ) . Then I remove those
indices. I should get back the x that I started with since there are no
items in x which are bigger than 100 . Instead, it is returning an empty
vector.

Why is this ? What am I misunderstanding?

Here's a hint:

# TRUE

The '-' is misleading - it is absorbed into the empty y, leaving the
request x[y] to be x for an empty set of indices.

Look at

which(x>100)

This is a zero-length vector. The negative of nothing is nothing, not a list of all possible index values.

Do you want

x[ !( x > 100 ) ]

?

Subject: [R] mgcv::gamm error when combining random smooths and
 correlation/autoregressive term
Message-ID: <B9A0D117-B6AB-42E7-9630-E0D21294DC90@gmail.com>

I am having difficulty fitting a mgcv::gamm model that includes both a random smooth term (i.e. 'fs' smooth) and autoregressive errors.  Standard smooth terms with a factor interaction using the 'by=' option work fine.  Both on my actual data and a toy example (below) I am getting the same error so am inclined to wonder if this is either a bug or a model that gamm is simply unable to fit?

Any insight or suggestions would be much appreciated.

M


Example:

library('mgcv')
set.seed(1)
df = data.frame(index=rep(1:10,5), x=runif(50,0,1), subject = as.factor(sort(rep(1:5,10))))

# random intercept
m1 = gamm(x~s(index), random=list(subject=~1), data=df, method = 'REML')

#factor interaction, random intercept, AR errors

Message-ID: <711c6e7437b7444aa2e9e17b5b605a48@wexchprod08.huge.ad.hcuge.ch>

Hello,

I am trying to graph a regression line using the followings:

Age <- c(39, 47, 45, 47, 65, 46, 67, 42, 67, 56, 64, 56, 59, 34, 42, 48, 45,
17, 20, 19, 36, 50, 39, 21, 44, 53, 63, 29, 25, 69)
BloodPressure <- c(144, 220, 138, 145, 162, 142, 170, 124, 158, 154, 162,
150, 140, 110, 128, 130, 135, 114, 116, 124, 136, 142, 120, 120, 160, 158,
144, 130, 125, 175)
SimpleLinearReg1=lm(Age ~ BloodPressure)
summary(SimpleLinearReg1)
eq = paste0("y = ", round(coeff[2],1), "*x ", round(coeff[1],1))
plot(Age, BloodPressure, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue",
main = eq, xlab = "Age (Year)", ylab = "Blood Pressure (mmHg)")
abline(SimpleLinearReg1, col="red")
mean(Age)
mean(BloodPressure)
abline(h=142.53, col="green")
abline(v=45.13, col="green")

But I cannot get the regression line. Can anybody tell me what's wrong with the codes ? I would appreciate very much. Thanks for any help.

Anne

Subject: [R] Reasons to Use R in a Public Administrations and Ideas for a
 Short Training
Message-ID: <20180418134721.aucxmerudjxk6hlj@chicca2>

Dear All,
Ages ago I posted to this mailing list asking for advice about to
evangelize the use of R in an international public
administration where the fact that R is free is not a decisive factor
(actually its being "freeware" may even be seen negatively). After a
long time, I think it is worthwhile asking the question again and see
what suggestions other users have.

Another question related to that: let's say you have the possibility
to give a short course (most likely short of 10 hours) to people
who are not trained in statistics (people with a background in
international relations or political scientists frustrated at Excel
and who sometimes have to do a number of repetitive tasks). How would
you formulate a short training to make them not R proficient users,
but aware and looking forward to learning more about R?
Any suggestion and/or pointer to online resources is appreciated.
Many thanks

Lorenzo

I'm not sure how you are incorporating time period into your data structure. Typically we are looking at plots or assemblages as the rows and taxa as the columns. Time period adds a third dimension that could be added as blocks of rows. For example, depending on the resolution of your data, one approach would be to have up to 8 rows for each locality: Loc1.1000, Loc1.2000, . . . Loc1.8000. If a locality did not have certain millennia represented you would just leave them out.

Subject: RE: nMDS with R: missing values

Dear Prof Carlson,

Thank you for your reply. I'm using 'vegan' with 'vegdist' and 'bray'. I have a selection of datasets that cover different time periods (converted to z-scores), so a record that starts 5000 years ago would have missing data before this date when other records cover the last 8000 years. I need to build into the nMDS the fact that this isn't a zero score, but reflects absence of data. In the results it seems that datasets that cover the same time periods are being grouped together because they have zero values at the same times. I hope that makes sense. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

There is no regular pattern to the position of the missing values, so I can't remove certain rows or columns. Thank you for the suggestion of using dist() and na.rm=TRUE. I will try using these approaches.

Kind regards,

Jessie

Subject: RE: nMDS with R: missing values

I think you will have to provide some more information. What function/package are you using for nMDS (eg. isoMDS in MASS, monoMDS in vegan)? What function/package are you using to compute your distance/dissimilarities (eg. dist in stats, vegdist in vegan)?

Zero represents absence. It is not a missing value, so that part of your question is not clear.

The dist() function computes distance ignoring missing values if they are properly represented as NAs in the data. The vegdist() function does this if na.rm=TRUE.

The results will be affected by how much data is missing. It would be useful to know if the missing values are concentrated in particular rows or columns so that eliminating a few rows and columns could substantially reduce the percentage of missing values.

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone might be able to provide some advice with an nMDS / R problem. I?m trying to run nMDS on a dataset that contains many missing values and was wondering how I can account for the missing values when running nMDS? It seems as though the data are being grouped depending on where the zero values appear. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.

Apologies if this message isn?t relevant to you.

Kind regards,

Not necessarily. The R-help archives are publicly accessible,
with a "sort by date" option. So if someone sets up a web=page
monitor which reports back when new messages appear there
(at the bpottom end), then their email addresses are readily
copied (subject to " at " --> "@".

Once they have the address then anything can happen!

Best wishes,
Ted (eagerly awaiting attempted seduction ... ).

As the others, I think that there is some kind of bot subscribed to the list, but also perhaps a spider or crawler monitoring the R-Help archive and getting email addresses there. Nabble is a possibility too.

Courses are good for people who are motivated to learn. It sounds like you need to generate the motivation first. Why not develop 4 - 5 case study examples? Kinds of analyses currently performed on Excel that would be easier to replicate and repeat using simple R scripts so that you are showing how it would be done in Excel and then how it would be done in R structuring the code so that running a similar analysis requires only minor adjustments in contrast to Excel which might involve copying formula blocks into a new spreadsheet tab or creating templates that fail and are hard to debug.

Subject: [R] Reasons to Use R in a Public Administrations and Ideas for a Short Training

Dear All,
Ages ago I posted to this mailing list asking for advice about to evangelize the use of R in an international public administration where the fact that R is free is not a decisive factor (actually its being "freeware" may even be seen negatively). After a long time, I think it is worthwhile asking the question again and see what suggestions other users have.

Another question related to that: let's say you have the possibility to give a short course (most likely short of 10 hours) to people who are not trained in statistics (people with a background in international relations or political scientists frustrated at Excel and who sometimes have to do a number of repetitive tasks). How would you formulate a short training to make them not R proficient users, but aware and looking forward to learning more about R?
Any suggestion and/or pointer to online resources is appreciated.
Many thanks

Lorenzo

Hi Anne,
I would suggest to change the linear model to lm(BloodPressure~Age), as
this model makes more sense in biological means (you would assume that
age influences pressure, not vice versa) and also obeys the statistical
assumption of weak exogeneity, that age can be measured without error,
at least compared to error-prone bp measures.

Cheers

To expand on Eik Vettorazzi's answer:

Don't use html emails. When the mailing list converts it to plain text, it often re-wraps lines so that your code becomes jumbled.

First, you did not define coeff. You need to add

coeff <- coef(SimpleLinearReg1)

Second, you should use the formula you used for the regression in the plot command or the correct order (plot uses the first variable as the x-axis and the second variable as the y-axis while the formula specification uses the variable on the left of the tilde (~) as the y-axis and the variable on the right of the tilde as the x-axis. Your regression predicts age (response) from blood pressure (explanatory) so abline() assumes age is on the y-axis and blood pressure is on the x-axis, but you reversed that so the line is "plotted", but it is outside the plot window. 

Either change the regression formula to BloodPressure~Age (which makes more sense than predicting age from blood pressure) or change the plot command to plot(BloodPressure, Age, ...) and change the xlab to ylab and ylab to xlab).

Hi Gerrit!
Thank you so much! I mistakenly reversed the order of the variables of the regression. Actually what I meant to write was: lm(BloodPressure ~ Age).
Best,
Anne

Hi, Anne,

assign Age and Bloodpressure in the correct order to the axes in your call to plot as in:

plot(y = Age, x = BloodPressure)
abline(SimpleLinearReg1)

I think you migh not have fully reviewed the available functions in that package. Doing an sos::findFn-search on ODE's with time delay brings up help pages for the `dede` function in deSolve. 

For the conditional value of the within regime-fixed parameter `m`, couldn't you just use this:

    ... + m*(6.8+ 3.2*(D < D_T))

Caveat: very lightly tested in your toy example, which did generate a result where D cross that threshold without blowing up.

I would recommend that you avoid converting (or letting R convert for you) your textual data values into factors until you have finished doing this kind of modification.

You can restore the column to character data type either re-reading it with the stringsAsFactors=FALSE option to read.table/read.csv functions, or by converting it:

dat[[ 3 ]] <- as.character( dat[[ 3 ]] )

and then your replacement will work.

The simplest would be to convert precip to character and then back to a factor if you really want it to be a factor. This will also remove the levels that no longer exist.

str(dat)
# 'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ Sites : Factor w/ 5 levels "Site1","Site2",..: 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ temp  : num  14 15 12 12.5 17
#  $ precip: Factor w/ 5 levels "15","34","high",..: 3 4 5 2 1

dat$precip <- as.character(dat$precip)
dat[4:5, 3] <-"20"
dat$precip <- factor(dat$precip)

str(dat)
# 'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ Sites : Factor w/ 5 levels "Site1","Site2",..: 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ temp  : num  14 15 12 12.5 17
#  $ precip: Factor w/ 4 levels "20","high","low",..: 2 3 4 1 1

Hi R user,
Would you mind to help me on how I can change a value in a specific column and row in a big table? but the column of the table is a factor (not numeric).
Here is an example. I want to change dat[4:5,3]<-"20" but it generated NA> do you have any suggestions for me?

Hi David and Jeff,
Both ways worked for my table. it helped me a lot (I was really struggling
on it to change the values and thinking to do manually). You are great.
Thank you

HI All,

I found that other R users experienced the same problem when using sqldf package. An expert provided solution, adding "method="raw" at the end as below, one or more of the columns in my data.frame are of class "AsIs" ( I don't know what it is) .  When sqldf retrieves the result from SQLite it will be numeric or character and since it was originally of class AsIs,  it tries to convert it back but R provides no as.AsIs,  so it fails; use method = "raw", so sqldf will not try to convert  the results from the database.

DMRlog2pbde47DMS <- sqldf("select * from DMR_log2pbde47 as a left join DMS_log2pbde47 as b 
                           on a.chrom = b.chromo and a.start <= b.MAPINFO and a.end >= b.MAPINFO", method = "raw" )

Dear R users,

I need to merge two data frames based on both equal and unequal comparisons.  The "sqldf" package used to work well , but today, I cannot resolve the following error by reinstallation of the sqldf package.   Can anyone suggest a different way to perform this kind of merge function?

Thank you,

Hello,
I have a data frame with 400 columns and wanted to filter character columns with "$" in it.For example:?>? x <- c("$5", "$89", "$10", "$34")??>? y <- c(1:4)>? My.Data <- data.frame (x,y)> My.Data? ? x y1? $5 12 $89 23 $10 34 $34 4
I want to detect the columns with $ and remove the $ from the selected columns.I have tried?apply(My.Data, 2, function (x) any(grepl("$", x))) but it's not really working.Or:??apply(My.Data, 2, function(x){x<-gsub("\\$", "", x)}) works but it turns all the columns to a factor.
Thanks.

Hi Farnoosh,
Perhaps this will help:

drop_dollar<-function(x) return(as.numeric(as.character(gsub("\\$","",x))))
sapply(My.Data,drop_dollar)

Your message came through all messed up because you did not tell your email program to use plain text format. This at best delays a responds and at worst prevents us from understanding your question as you intended.

1) The columns became factors when you created the data frame because you did not include the stringsAsFactors=FALSE argument. The apply function does NOT turn the columns to factors. 

2) Your use of "x <-" in your apply function is misleading, though not destructive. Just omit that assignment. 

dta2 <- apply(My.Data, 2, function (x) gsub("\\$", "", x)))

Hello,

To the OP:
The dollar sign is a meta character, so it must be escaped, that is what 
was wrong with your code. The right regular expression would be

grepl("\\$", x)

When a regular expression doesn't work, try reading the help page ?regex.

Another good source you can try is

https://regex101.com


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi all,

I am looking for syntax to read a list of *txt files, (loop through?) 
each with a different data content but same fields, then run lines of 
code to produce summary stats (I have working code for this) and add the 
matching data file name when writing the results of a line of R code.?? 
Suggestions on any package vignettes that may be useful welcomed.

My manual code for this is below and need to understand how to have the 
"DataFile" name changed to match the name of each data file as it is 
read and processed.

*write.csv(BatStats,file="C:\\=Bat data working\\Acoustic 
Parameters\\DataFile_Stats.csv")*

I need your help because I am having difficulties to finalize an econometric model.By the way, I want to calculate the standard error with delta method in a 2sls model with interactions under R.I want to determine the total effect of the institutions (Institutions + D_MinMond * Institutions) on logYLby summing the estimated parameters of (Institutions) and (D_MinMond * Institutions);D_MinMond is a dummy taking 0 or 1. But I can not find the right code to calculate the standard error under RHere is the equation for this estimate:reg_iv2<-ivreg(logYL~Institutions+D_MinMond+D_MinMondInstitutions|xconst+xrreg+D_MinMond+D_MinMondInstitutions,data=bdd2)

Dear Lorenzo,

First of all I would focus on topics which immediately usable by your
audience. E.g. making figures and tables based on preprocessed data
files (txt, Excel, GoogleSheets, data base query, ...). And pick
examples in which the definition of the figures and tables remains
more or less stable but the data is updated with some frequency. In a
next step you could focus on processing the data.

I would even skip the step of writing R scripts and start with basic R
notebooks. The ability to include both plain text and code into one
source document is very useful for repetitive tasks. And you
significantly reduce the need to copy/paste results.

Think about a list of packages which you can recommend to your
audience. I would consider the tidyverse collection.

Hello,

You can process several files at a time with repeated use of *appy 
functions. Something like the following (not tested).


# This first instruction may not be needed
old_dir <- setwd("path/to/txt/files")

# Get the filenames in a vector and read them in
txt_files <- list.files(pattern = ".*\\.txt")
txt_list <- lapply(txt_files, read.table, args)


In the above lapply command, args are the arguments to read.table. For 
instance, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, etc.

Now put your summary stats code in a function and run it through the 
data.frames in the list. Then save the results as csv files.


stats_list <- lapply(txt_list, summary_stats_function)

csv_files <- sub("txt", "csv", txt_files)
lapply(seq_along(csv_files), function(i) write.csv(stats_list[[i]], 
csv_files[i]))

setwd(old_dir)    # reset, if needed


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

A few years ago I gave two 5-hour workshops about R to a class of US high
school students in a somewhat-accelerated science research class (so these
were already science-motivated kids).  They had been using mainly Excel,
and some SPSS for which the school had a license.  Overall they seemed to
like the sessions. They started a computer programming club afterward, and
some continued to use R.

As for motivation, I found it helpful with the kids to contrast the
instructions for making a scatterplot in Excel, with the command in R.  You
can find many long documents on the internet describing how to do it in
Excel. Find a long one (I've seen 17 pages) filled with screenshots and
many numbered steps ("click here, then click there, then click over here .
. . ")  Then contrast it with something like plot(force, acceleration) or
plot(x,y)   It becomes pretty clear which is easier (postponing, for the
moment, the question of where x and y came from)

Showing cool graphs that could never be made in Excel is also helpful.

Lastly, in the international setting you describe, I would emphasize the
portability of code. Ask them how, with Excel, they would share their
analysis steps with colleagues in another country, for application to the
colleagues' data.

Subject: [R] create multiple categorical variables in a data frame using a
 loop
Message-ID: <A86C6438FB909A409DDEF926277952B6A7F177@PPWEXCH2KX14.coh.org>

Hi All,

I want to create a categorical variable, cat.pfoa, in the file of pfas.pheno (a data frame) based on log2pfoa values. I can do it using the following code.

pfas.pheno <-within(pfas.pheno, {cat.pfoa<-NA
  cat.pfoa[pfas.pheno$log2pfoa <=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.25, na.rm =T)]<-0
  cat.pfoa[pfas.pheno$log2pfoa >=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.75, na.rm =T)]<-2
  cat.pfoa[pfas.pheno$log2pfoa >=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.25, na.rm =T)
           &pfas.pheno$log2pfoa <=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.75, na.rm =T)]<-1
  }

However, I have additional 7 similar variables, so I wrote the following code, but it does not work.

for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh", "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {

Hello,

When programming it is better to use dat[["variable"]] than dat$variable.

So your code could be

pfas.pheno[[cat.var]] <- NA
pfas.pheno[[cat.var]][pfas.pheno[,i] <= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.25, 
na.rm =T)] <- 0

etc.

Untested.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

This would be somewhat more compact and easier to maintain if you used findInterval (untested in the absence of a data object, which is your responsibility):

pfas.pheno <-within(pfas.pheno, {
 cat.pfoa  <- findInterval( log2pfoa , c(-Inf, quantile( log2pfoa,c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } )
 

`findInterval` numbers its intervals from 1, so to get a sequence starting at 0 just subtract 1.

Nope. Cannot use R like a macro processor, at least not easily. R names are not the same as character vlaues. They "live in different realities". The `get` and `assign` functions can be used to "promote" character values to real R names and make assignments from and to what would otherwise be merely character values.

Perhaps this (also mostly untested (except for the strategy of making `assign` creat a new dataframe column:

 for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh",  
             "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
  cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
  assign( cat.var, findInterval( get(i) , c(-Inf, quantile( get(i), c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } ),  
                   envir=as.environment( get( pfas.pheno ) ) )

Best;
David.

That wasn't good advice. I would rather suggest (but still untested in the absence of a good demo dataset from the OP):

for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh",  
            "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
 cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
 pfas.pheno[[ cat.var ]] <-  findInterval( get(i) , c(-Inf, quantile( get(i), c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } 

The "[[<-" function supports character values as column names during assignment.

Definitely!  Thank you, Olivier.

I had not replied because the question looked more like homework
than something for which R-help is appropropriate.

There is the 'robustbase' package and more of a dozen other high
quality R packages about robust statistics -- in which
"breakdown point" is one crucial concept.

BTW: What econometricians tend to call "robust" is the idea
of using "sandwich" estimates (--> 'sandwich' package in R), aka
Newey-West aka HAC (Heteroscadisticity And Correlation adjusted) estimates.

Robust statistics in a proper sense considers "sensitivity" of
both estimates and their precision estimates in situations where
the distributional assumption (e.g. Gaussian errors) is only
approximately true, say 95% of the observations/errors/.. are Gaussian but the
remaining 5% can be anything (-> arbitrary extreme outliers).

There's the CRAN task view on robust statistical methods:

 Dear R Developers,

I hope this email finds you well.

As a newcomer to the world of R, I'm trying different exercises. In my way,
I faced with some, seemingly, trivial problems but there is not any
response for that around the web. So, I thought can get help from you.
Specifically, in tutorial presented at http://www.rdatamining.com/doc
s/twitter-analysis-with-r,  I faced with a problem on using OAuth. When I
use the first approach, the following error will be occurred:

[1] "Using browser based authentication"
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) :
  Failed to connect to api.twitter.com port 443: Connection refused


And when it comes to the second approach, the following error rises:

[1] "Using direct authentication"
Error in check_twitter_oauth() : OAuth authentication error:
This most likely means that you have incorrectly called
setup_twitter_oauth()'

Unfortunately, the online resources could not help. For example, all the
solutions introduced in StackOverflow could not work for me.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31128492/twitter-setup-t
witter-oauth-failing

*Moreover, in reading data from the current directory, the readRDS method
sucks*. I got same error using import() in rio package.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49908803/error-in-reading-files-in-r

So, please  let me know if you have some solution for the issues.

Thanks for your consideration.

Hi R folks,
In my previous post I forgot to mention that I was new to R. I was really grateful for your quick help. I have two further questions:
1) In the graph of a regression line I would like to show one specific residual yi obs - yi pred (let's take the person whose residual is 76). How do I add a bracket to this vertical distance and name it? I'am getting stuck after the "textxy" function.
Age <- c(39, 47, 45, 47, 65, 46, 67, 42, 67, 56, 64, 56, 59, 34, 42, 48, 45, 
17, 20, 19, 36, 50, 39, 21, 44, 53, 63, 29, 25, 69)
BloodPressure <- c(144, 220, 138, 145, 162, 142, 170, 124, 158, 154, 162, 
150, 140, 110, 128, 130, 135, 114, 116, 124, 136, 142, 120, 120, 160, 158, 
144, 130, 125, 175)
mean(Age)
mean(BloodPressure)
SimpleLinearReg1 <- lm(BloodPressure ~ Age)
summary(SimpleLinearReg1)
coeff <-coefficients(SimpleLinearReg1)
coeff
eq <- as.formula(
  paste0("y ~ ", round(coefficients(SimpleLinearReg1)[1],2), "", 
    paste(sprintf(" %+.2f*%s ", 
                  coefficients(SimpleLinearReg1)[-1],  
                  names(coefficients(SimpleLinearReg1)[-1])), 
          collapse="")))
eq <- paste0("y = ", round(coeff[2],1), "x + ", round(coeff[1],1))
plot(Age, BloodPressure, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", 
main = "Graphe de la relation entre l'?ge et la pression art?rielle", 
xlab = "Age (ann?e)", ylab = "Pression art?rielle (mmHg)")
abline(SimpleLinearReg1, col="red")
res <- signif(residuals(SimpleLinearReg1), 2)
pre <- predict(SimpleLinearReg1) 
segments(Age, BloodPressure, Age, pre, col="red")

textxy(Age, BloodPressure, res, cex=0.7) 2) 

2) I also need your help plotting a hyperplan for a multiple regression and here I am really stuck...
inc <- c(25000, 28000, 17500, 30000, 25000, 32000, 30000, 29000, 26000, 40000)
age <- c(60, 36, 21, 35, 33, 43, 29, 45, 41, 48)
educ <- c(12, 12, 13, 16, 16, 12, 13, 15, 15, 20)
MultLinearReg1 <- lm(inc ~ age + educ)
summary(MultLinearReg1)

Thank you so much!

Hello, Anne,

just a few quick hints because I need to run.

First, try to format you R-code in emails like this
with adequate line breaks.

Second, if you boil down your problem to the crucial point
(and not just pack an email with very specific code) more
people may be more willing to respond.

Third, just to be sure: This list is not for home work.

Two more remarks see inline below.

I don't understand what mean by "to add a bracket", but why
don't you just place a "name" next to the vertical line at
residual # 76 using the function text?

This is a bit more complicated. Learn, e.g., about function persp
or search for "plot regression surface with r" and find, e.g.,
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7863906/plot-regression-surface#7864088 
as the first hit.

That wasn't good advice. I would rather suggest (but still untested in the absence of a good demo dataset from the OP):

for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh",  
            "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
 cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
 pfas.pheno[[ cat.var ]] <-  findInterval( get(i) , c(-Inf, quantile( get(i), c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } 

The "[[<-" function supports character values as column names during assignment.

Looks like you have not obtained a proper Twitter account and obtained a valid registration code to use the API. That should have been covered in your course materials.

Generally use of such a description will be viewed as at best useless and at worst offensive.

That posting describes entirely different issue. The first issue was that the file wasn't where you thought it was and the second error message that you posted in comments said it was the wrong format for the readRDS function.

There are two files with that name listed on the website and only one of them loads properly with readRDS.

Subject: [R] Check if row of dataframe is superset of any row in another
 dataframe.
Message-ID: <CAMe08vun6haoQA_3iNmc1gcqYLtxz+2FDRPEnZYRPkVhZskG4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am looking for a way in which I can check if rows in 1 dataframe are
present in another data frame in a unique way. A row in dataframe should be
super set of any row in another dataframe.

I can write a for loop for it, however, that will be inefficient. So, I am
looking for an efficient way to do this in R.

I have explained it with an example below:

I want to check if a row in dataframe B is:
1) either equal to any row in A or
2) has 1's atleast for the columns where (any) row in B has 1's.

My output/result is a vector of 1(TRUE) or 0(FALSE) of length equal to
number of rows in B. The first row in B is exactly present in A so result
has first bit as 1. Second row in B has matches with 2nd row of dataframe A
(it has an extra 1 in 3rd column,which is ok);so second bit of result is
also 1. Similarly, the 3rd row of B, can match to any row in A, so 3rd bit
in result is also a 1. Next, 4th row in B has 1 for a column where no row
in A has 1, so last bit in result is 0.

Dataframe A
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0

Dataframe B
1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1

Result<- 1 1 1 0

Thanks for the help,
Neha

How about this?

A <- as.matrix(A)
B <- as.matrix(B)

C   <- A %*% t(B)
SA  <- apply(A, MAR=1, sum )
SB  <- apply(B, MAR=1, sum )
vapply( 1:nrow(B), function(j) { sum( C[,j]==SA & SA <= SB[j] ) > 0 }, 1 )

HTH,
Eric

Hi Neha,
How about this?

find_subset<-function(x,y) {
 yrows<-dim(y)[1]
 match<-0
 for(row in 1:yrows) match<-sum(x&y[row]) >= sum(y[row])
 return(match)
}
apply(B,1,find_subset,A)

This is somewhat obscure, as the dataframe B is coerced to a matrix by
the apply function.

Subject: [R] Error : 'start' contains NA values when fitting frank copula
Message-ID: <CAEZF6yyQO0KbD2tJeWP+2KO-dMj_W1czHqGPjioctGjJLwz+jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!
I am trying to fit a copula to some data in R and I get the error mentioned
above. This is the code for a reproducible example -

library(copula)
data = matrix(data=runif(600),nrow=200,ncol=3)
data[,2] = 2*data[,1]
data[,3] = 3*data[,1]
fr_cop = frankCopula(dim=3)
fit_fr_cop = fitCopula(fr_cop,pobs(data),method = "mpl") #Error Here

The error says : Error in fitCopula.ml(copula, u = data, method = method,
start = start, : 'start' contains NA values

What could be going wrong?

(not really reproducible: You did not set the random seed, so
 the data is different every time;
 OTOH, yes, the following always gives an error)

    > library(copula)

Slightly clearer showing what you are doing:

    x <- runif(200)
    data <- cbind(x, 2*x, 3*x)

    > fr_cop = frankCopula(dim=3)
    > fit_fr_cop = fitCopula(fr_cop, pobs(data), method = "mpl") #Error Here

    > The error says : Error in fitCopula.ml(copula, u = data, method = method,

    > What could be going wrong?

Is this a homework question? [probably not, but ..]

The homework question & answer would be

Q:  What is the best fitting 3D copula if you have perfectly
    correlated ("rank 1") data?

A:  The complete-dependence copula ... which is indeed a boundary case,
    hard to imagine you'd encounter for non-artifical data.

Another hint:

> fitCopula(normalCopula(,3), pobs(data))
Call: fitCopula(copula, data = data)
Fit based on "maximum pseudo-likelihood" and 200 3-dimensional observations.
Copula: normalCopula 
rho.1 
    1 
The maximized loglikelihood is 3686 
Optimization converged
>
-----------

Yes, one could adapt the fitCopula() code to work better for
this extreme boundary case,
and for the Frank copula,  it would return

> fitCopula(frankCopula(,3), pobs(data))
Call: fitCopula(copula, data = data)
Fit based on "maximum pseudo-likelihood" and 200 3-dimensional observations.
Copula: frankCopula 
   alpha 
7.21e+16 
The maximized loglikelihood is 1.798e+308 
Optimization converged


but it would need even more tweaking to also give such
  "alpha ~= +Inf"
results for other cases such as Gumbel or Joe.

I may add the possibility for frank*() as shown above for the
next release of the copula package...
but am a bit hesitant to complicate (and slowdown) the current
code by adding an extra check for this situation.

Subject: [R] Removing columns from big.matrix which have only one value
Message-ID: <CADbGCVj_NwwubSESQwTtHna_J==Ane7cWVhNq4PzgPA76q57Zw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a very large binary matrix, stored as a big.matrix to conserve
memory (it is over 2 gb otherwise - 5 million columns and 100 rows).

r <- 100
c <- 10000
m4 <- matrix(sample(0:1,r*c, replace=TRUE),r,c)
m4 <- cbind(m4, 1)
m4 <- as.big.matrix(m4)

I need to remove every column which has only one unique value (in this
case, only 0s or only 1s). Because of the number of columns, I want to be
able to do this in parallel.

How can I accomplish this while keeping the data compressed as a
big.matrix? I can convert it into a df and loop over the columns looking
for the number of unique values, but this takes too much RAM.

Thanks!

Maybe base R's  unique() function might be useful? It uses hashing I
believe.

Hi Martin,
Thanks for the reply. I tried to make a toy example so that I could get the
same error. I have attached the data file for which the error occurs in my
program.
The code after loading this file is -

fr_cop = frankCopula(dim=6)
fit_fr_cop = fitCopula(fr_cop,pobs(data),method="mpl")

This is about looking for the degree of monetary independence between a
country and large economies. In this data, the "this" country is UK, so
that there are two columns which are exactly equal, but there are 4 other
columns which aren't. Is this a valid case?

Subject: [R] How to dynamically add variables to a dataframe
Message-ID: <CABQyo86EpoJt33VLHK2gUPVQ=6Fz=3HAaM4e_FQP-nOpAoQW_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a bit rusty with R programming and do not seem to find a solution to
add a number of variables to my existing dataframe. Basically I need to add
n=dim(d1)[1] variables to my d0 dataframe and I would like them to be named
V1, V2, V3, ... , V[dim(d1)[1])

When running the following code:

for (t in 1:dim(d1)[1]){
  d0$V[t] <- 0
}

all I get is a V variable populated with zeros...

I am sure there is a fairly straightforward code to accomplish what I need,
any suggestion?

Thank you,

Luca

Are you missing values coded as missing values? That is, are they NA? Such NA-values should be handled by vegan::monoMDS. Naturally, it can be possible that your data set cannot be meaningfully analysed if you have too many missing values or missing values are grouped in peculiar ways. Zero-values are not missing values, but they indicate 0-difference (= identical observations). The missing values must be coded as NA.

Wouldn't the obvious problem be that your data file is corrupted or was never created  using saveRDS in the first place? Can you show us a complete example of creating and attempting to read what was just created?

Subject: [R] Gantt Chart Using Plotrix
Message-ID: <162eeb12427-c8b-9f7d@webjasstg-vab42.srv.aolmail.net>

Hi

I am trying to generate a complex Gantt chart using the gantt.chart function in the plotrix package.

Ideally I would like to use a spreadsheet to populate the activities (tasks) and start and end dates that this function expects and then export the spreadsheet file as a .CSV text file so I can read in this file to generate the gantt chart. Reading through the help file I have not been able to see what exactly this spreadsheet should like. The example provided with the "gantt.chart" function seems to indicate all the information needs to be hand coded. Because of the complexity of my chart this is not only very error prone but also is impractical. 

Can anyone help me with this? There is also a "get.gantt.info" function for creating a gantt object but the help on this is almost next to nothing !

Any help you can provide on this would be great.

There is another R package called "plan" which is very user friendly but for my purpose this doesn't have all the functionality I am looking for.

Thanks
indr

Manually adding the required tasks and dates (as given in the help file example) is not practical for my situation ....

Hi,

The help file for gantt.chart states that dates must be in POSIXct
format, and the example shows how to do that. There's no reason that I
can see that you can't use a data frame as input to gantt.chart, but
you need to be very careful that your data frame matches the correct
format. I bet also that your character fields were imported as
factors, because you didn't specify not to.

Try running the first couple lines of the example code, then compare

str(abc)

with

str(gantt.info)

and adjust the format of your dataset as necessary.

If you still can't figure it out, then use dput(abc) to provide a
reproducible example, and submit that to the list. We can't tell the
format of the various columns from a copy and paste.

Hi bbb_aaa,
The format for the input to the function (gantt.info) is a list. As
Sarah mentions, a data frame is a list, so as long as your columns
have the right names and are in the correct order, it should work. As
you probably know, you can import a CSV file into R as a data frame
using read.csv

Hi Sarah

Thank you very much for your pointers.

Is there a way to specify the date string as POSIXct when reading in? 

I have tried the following (very inelegant way) and still have no luck.

--- Begin Code ---

# 1st read in the spreadsheet with stringsAsFactors set to FALSE

> abc <- read.csv("gntr1.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> abc
  code tasks.labels      start        end depends done
1  101       task 1 2018-04-01 2018-04-15     101  100
2  102        task2 2018-04-15 2018-05-31     101   50
3  103       task 3 2018-06-01 2018-06-30     102    0


 # Next convert the date strings to POSIXct format:
 # The Idea here is to take each of the individual columns in the spreadsheet
 # and convert them to the required format and then assemble the dataframe back again:
 
 
> c1d1 <- abc$tasks.labels
> c1d1
[1] "task 1" "task2"  "task 3"
> c2d1 <- as.POSIXct(abc$start)
> c2d1
[1] "2018-04-01 EDT" "2018-04-15 EDT" "2018-06-01 EDT"
> c3d1 <- as.POSIXct(abc$end)
> c3d1
[1] "2018-04-15 EDT" "2018-05-31 EDT" "2018-06-30 EDT"
> cdfg <- data.frame(c1d1,c2d1,c3d1)
> cdfg
    c1d1       c2d1       c3d1
1 task 1 2018-04-01 2018-04-15
2  task2 2018-04-15 2018-05-31
3 task 3 2018-06-01 2018-06-30


# But still no luck !

> gantt.chart(cdfg)
Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, "priorities", value = numeric(0)) : 
  replacement has 0 rows, data has 3
> str(cdfg)
'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ c1d1: Factor w/ 3 levels "task 1","task 3",..: 1 3 2

> dput(cdfg)

"task 3", "task2"), class = "factor"), c2d1 = structure(c(1522555200, 
1523764800, 1527825600), class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt"), tzone = ""), 
    c3d1 = structure(c(1523764800, 1527739200, 1530331200), class = c("POSIXct", 
    "POSIXt"), tzone = "")), .Names = c("c1d1", "c2d1", "c3d1"

Please read the Arguments and Details sections of the help page for read.csv with particular attention to the colClasses argument options.

There was a question with similar content on SO a couple of days ago. I searched for and found the rds file that was claimed to be difficult to load but had no errors when I loaded it from a copy taken from the Web. The first error indicated that the user had failed to provide the correct path/name for the file the second error (for which no code was offered) reported was that their copy was corrupt.

So this puts the onus on you to show the code that you used that was giving errors. Also need version numbers (OS, R, packages) and all the usual information outlined in the Posting Guide.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 3.5.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * All packages are by default byte-compiled on installation.  This
      makes the installed packages larger (usually marginally so) and
      may affect the format of messages and tracebacks (which often
      exclude .Call and similar).

  NEW FEATURES:

    * factor() now uses order() to sort its levels, rather than
      sort.list().  This allows factor() to support custom vector-like
      objects if methods for the appropriate generics are defined.  It
      has the side effect of making factor() succeed on empty or
      length-one non-atomic vector(-like) types (e.g., "list"), where
      it failed before.

    * diag() gets an optional names argument: this may require updates
      to packages defining S4 methods for it.

    * chooseCRANmirror() and chooseBioCmirror() no longer have a
      useHTTPS argument, not needed now all R builds support https://
      downloads.

    * New summary() method for warnings() with a (somewhat
      experimental) print() method.

    * (methods package.) .self is now automatically registered as a
      global variable when registering a reference class method.

    * tempdir(check = TRUE) recreates the tempdir() directory if it is
      no longer valid (e.g. because some other process has cleaned up
      the /tmp directory).

    * New askYesNo() function and "askYesNo" option to ask the user
      binary response questions in a customizable but consistent way.
      (Suggestion of PR#17242.)

    * New low level utilities ...elt(n) and ...length() for working
      with ... parts inside a function.

    * isTRUE() is more tolerant and now true in
      
         x <- rlnorm(99)
         isTRUE(median(x) == quantile(x)["50%"])

      New function isFALSE() defined analogously to isTRUE().

    * The default symbol table size has been increased from 4119 to
      49157; this may improve the performance of symbol resolution when
      many packages are loaded.  (Suggested by Jim Hester.)

    * line() gets a new option iter = 1.

    * Reading from connections in text mode is buffered, significantly
      improving the performance of readLines(), as well as scan() and
      read.table(), at least when specifying colClasses.

    * order() is smarter about picking a default sort method when its
      arguments are objects.

    * available.packages() has two new arguments which control if the
      values from the per-session repository cache are used (default
      true, as before) and if so how old cached values can be to be
      used (default one hour).

      These arguments can be passed from install.packages(),
      update.packages() and functions calling that: to enable this
      available.packages(), packageStatus() and download.file() gain a
      ... argument.

    * packageStatus()'s upgrade() method no longer ignores its ...
      argument but passes it to install.packages().

    * installed.packages() gains a ... argument to allow arguments
      (including noCache) to be passed from new.packages(),
      old.packages(), update.packages() and packageStatus().

    * factor(x, levels, labels) now allows duplicated labels (not
      duplicated levels!).  Hence you can map different values of x to
      the same level directly.

    * Attempting to use names<-() on an S4 derivative of a basic type
      no longer emits a warning.

    * The list method of within() gains an option keepAttrs = FALSE for
      some speed-up.

    * system() and system2() now allow the specification of a maximum
      elapsed time ('timeout').

    * debug() supports debugging of methods on any object of S4 class
      "genericFunction", including group generics.

    * Attempting to increase the length of a variable containing NULL
      using length()<- still has no effect on the target variable, but
      now triggers a warning.

    * type.convert() becomes a generic function, with additional
      methods that operate recursively over list and data.frame
      objects. Courtesy of Arni Magnusson (PR#17269).

    * lower.tri(x) and upper.tri(x) only needing dim(x) now work via
      new functions .row() and .col(), so no longer call as.matrix() by
      default in order to work efficiently for all kind of matrix-like
      objects.

    * print() methods for "xgettext" and "xngettext" now use
      encodeString() which keeps, e.g. "\n", visible.  (Wish of
      PR#17298.)

    * package.skeleton() gains an optional encoding argument.

    * approx(), spline(), splinefun() and approxfun() also work for
      long vectors.

    * deparse() and dump() are more useful for S4 objects, dput() now
      using the same internal C code instead of its previous imperfect
      workaround R code.  S4 objects now typically deparse perfectly,
      i.e., can be recreated identically from deparsed code.

      dput(), deparse() and dump() now print the names() information
      only once, using the more readable (tag = value) syntax, notably
      for list()s, i.e., including data frames.

      These functions gain a new control option "niceNames" (see
      .deparseOpts()), which when set (as by default) also uses the
      (tag = value) syntax for atomic vectors.  On the other hand,
      without deparse options "showAttributes" and "niceNames", names
      are no longer shown also for lists.  as.character(list( c (one =
      1))) now includes the name, as as.character(list(list(one = 1)))
      has always done.

      m:n now also deparses nicely when m > n.

      The "quoteExpressions" option, also part of "all", no longer
      quote()s formulas as that may not re-parse identically.
      (PR#17378)

    * If the option setWidthOnResize is set and TRUE, R run in a
      terminal using a recent readline library will set the width
      option when the terminal is resized.  Suggested by Ralf Goertz.

    * If multiple on.exit() expressions are set using add = TRUE then
      all expressions will now be run even if one signals an error.

    * mclapply() gets an option affinity.list which allows more
      efficient execution with heterogeneous processors, thanks to
      Helena Kotthaus.

    * The character methods for as.Date() and as.POSIXlt() are more
      flexible _via_ new arguments tryFormats and optional: see their
      help pages.

    * on.exit() gains an optional argument after with default TRUE.
      Using after = FALSE with add = TRUE adds an exit expression
      before any existing ones. This way the expressions are run in a
      first-in last-out fashion. (From Lionel Henry.)

    * On Windows, file.rename() internally retries the operation in
      case of error to attempt to recover from possible anti-virus
      interference.

    * Command line completion on :: now also includes lazy-loaded data.

    * If the TZ environment variable is set when date-time functions
      are first used, it is recorded as the session default and so will
      be used rather than the default deduced from the OS if TZ is
      subsequently unset.

    * There is now a [ method for class "DLLInfoList".

    * glm() and glm.fit get the same singular.ok = TRUE argument that
      lm() has had forever.  As a consequence, in glm(*, method =
      <your_own>), user specified methods need to accept a singular.ok
      argument as well.

    * aspell() gains a filter for Markdown (.md and .Rmd) files.

    * intToUtf8(multiple = FALSE) gains an argument to allow surrogate
      pairs to be interpreted.

    * The maximum number of DLLs that can be loaded into R e.g. _via_
      dyn.load() has been increased up to 614 when the OS limit on the
      number of open files allows.

    * Sys.timezone() on a Unix-alike caches the value at first use in a
      session: _inter alia_ this means that setting TZ later in the
      session affects only the _current_ time zone and not the _system_
      one.

      Sys.timezone() is now used to find the system timezone to pass to
      the code used when R is configured with --with-internal-tzcode.

    * When tar() is used with an external command which is detected to
      be GNU tar or libarchive tar (aka bsdtar), a different
      command-line is generated to circumvent line-length limits in the
      shell.

    * system(*, intern = FALSE), system2() (when not capturing output),
      file.edit() and file.show() now issue a warning when the external
      command cannot be executed.

    * The "default" ("lm" etc) methods of vcov() have gained new
      optional argument complete = TRUE which makes the vcov() methods
      more consistent with the coef() methods in the case of singular
      designs.  The former (back-compatible) behavior is given by
      vcov(*, complete = FALSE).

    * coef() methods (for lm etc) also gain a complete = TRUE optional
      argument for consistency with vcov().
      For "aov", both coef() and vcov() methods remain back-compatibly
      consistent, using the _other_ default, complete = FALSE.

    * attach(*, pos = 1) is now an error instead of a warning.

    * New function getDefaultCluster() in package parallel to get the
      default cluster set via setDefaultCluster().

    * str(x) for atomic objects x now treats both cases of is.vector(x)
      similarly, and hence much less often prints "atomic".  This is a
      slight non-back-compatible change producing typically both more
      informative and shorter output.

    * write.dcf() gets optional argument useBytes.

    * New, partly experimental packageDate() which tries to get a valid
      "Date" object from a package DESCRIPTION file, thanks to
      suggestions in PR#17324.

    * tools::resaveRdaFiles() gains a version argument, for use when
      packages should remain compatible with earlier versions of R.

    * ar.yw(x) and hence by default ar(x) now work when x has NAs,
      mostly thanks to a patch by Pavel Krivitsky in PR#17366.  The
      ar.yw.default()'s AIC computations have become more efficient by
      using determinant().

    * New warnErrList() utility (from package nlme, improved).

    * By default the (arbitrary) signs of the loadings from princomp()
      are chosen so the first element is non-negative.

    * If --default-packages is not used, then Rscript now checks the
      environment variable R_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_PACKAGES. If this is set,
      then it takes precedence over R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES. If default
      packages are not specified on the command line or by one of these
      environment variables, then Rscript now uses the same default
      packages as R. For now, the previous behavior of not including
      methods can be restored by setting the environment variable
      R_SCRIPT_LEGACY to yes.

    * When a package is found more than once, the warning from
      find.package(*, verbose=TRUE) lists all library locations.

    * POSIXt objects can now also be rounded or truncated to month or
      year.

    * stopifnot() can be used alternatively via new argument exprs
      which is nicer and useful when testing several expressions in one
      call.

    * The environment variable R_MAX_VSIZE can now be used to specify
      the maximal vector heap size. On macOS, unless specified by this
      environment variable, the maximal vector heap size is set to the
      maximum of 16GB and the available physical memory. This is to
      avoid having the R process killed when macOS over-commits memory.

    * sum(x) and sum(x1,x2,..,x<N>) with many or long logical or
      integer vectors no longer overflows (and returns NA with a
      warning), but returns double numbers in such cases.

    * Single components of "POSIXlt" objects can now be extracted and
      replaced via [ indexing with 2 indices.

    * S3 method lookup now searches the namespace registry after the
      top level environment of the calling environment.

    * Arithmetic sequences created by 1:n, seq_along, and the like now
      use compact internal representations via the ALTREP framework.
      Coercing integer and numeric vectors to character also now uses
      the ALTREP framework to defer the actual conversion until first
      use.

    * Finalizers are now run with interrupts suspended.

    * merge() gains new option no.dups and by default suffixes the
      second of two duplicated column names, thanks to a proposal by
      Scott Ritchie (and Gabe Becker).

    * scale.default(x, center, scale) now also allows center or scale
      to be "numeric-alike", i.e., such that as.numeric(.) coerces them
      correctly.  This also eliminates a wrong error message in such
      cases.

    * par*apply and par*applyLB gain an optional argument chunk.size
      which allows to specify the granularity of scheduling.

    * Some as.data.frame() methods, notably the matrix one, are now
      more careful in not accepting duplicated or NA row names, and by
      default produce unique non-NA row names.  This is based on new
      function .rowNamesDF(x, make.names = *) <- rNms where the logical
      argument make.names allows to specify _how_ invalid row names
      rNms are handled.  .rowNamesDF() is a "workaround" compatible
      default.

    * R has new serialization format (version 3) which supports custom
      serialization of ALTREP framework objects.  These objects can
      still be serialized in format 2, but less efficiently.
      Serialization format 3 also records the current native encoding
      of unflagged strings and converts them when de-serialized in R
      running under different native encoding.  Format 3 comes with new
      serialization magic numbers (RDA3, RDB3, RDX3).  Format 3 can be
      selected by version = 3 in save(), serialize() and saveRDS(), but
      format 2 remains the default for all serialization and saving of
      the workspace.  Serialized data in format 3 cannot be read by
      versions of R prior to version 3.5.0.

    * The "Date" and "date-time" classes "POSIXlt" and "POSIXct" now
      have a working `length<-` method, as wished in PR#17387.

    * optim(*, control = list(warn.1d.NelderMead = FALSE)) allows to
      turn off the warning when applying the default "Nelder-Mead"
      method to 1-dimensional problems.

    * matplot(.., panel.first = .) etc now work, as log becomes
      explicit argument and ... is passed to plot() unevaluated, as
      suggested by Sebastian Meyer in PR#17386.

    * Interrupts can be suspended while evaluating an expression using
      suspendInterrupts.  Subexpression can be evaluated with
      interrupts enabled using allowInterrupts.  These functions can be
      used to make sure cleanup handlers cannot be interrupted.

    * R 3.5.0 includes a framework that allows packages to provide
      alternate representations of basic R objects (ALTREP).  The
      framework is still experimental and may undergo changes in future
      R releases as more experience is gained. For now, documentation
      is provided in <URL:
      https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html>.

  UTILITIES:

    * install.packages() for source packages now has the possibility to
      set a 'timeout' (elapsed-time limit).  For serial installs this
      uses the timeout argument of system2(): for parallel installs it
      requires the timeout utility command from GNU coreutils.

    * It is now possible to set 'timeouts' (elapsed-time limits) for
      most parts of R CMD check _via_ environment variables documented
      in the 'R Internals' manual.

    * The 'BioC extra' repository which was dropped from Bioconductor
      3.6 and later has been removed from setRepositories().  This
      changes the mapping for 6-8 used by setRepositories(ind=).

    * R CMD check now also applies the settings of environment
      variables _R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_ and _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ to
      the re-building of vignettes.

    * R CMD check with environment variable _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ set
      to a true value makes test-suite-management packages available
      and (for the time being) works around a common omission of
      rmarkdown from the VignetteBuilder field.

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * Support for a system Java on macOS has been removed - install a
      fairly recent Oracle Java (see 'R Installation and
      Administration' SSC.3.2).

    * configure works harder to set additional flags in SAFE_FFLAGS
      only where necessary, and to use flags which have little or no
      effect on performance.

      In rare circumstances it may be necessary to override the setting
      of SAFE_FFLAGS.

    * C99 functions expm1, hypot, log1p and nearbyint are now required.

    * configure sets a -std flag for the C++ compiler for all supported
      C++ standards (e.g., -std=gnu++11 for the C++11 compiler).
      Previously this was not done in a few cases where the default
      standard passed the tests made (e.g. clang 6.0.0 for C++11).

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * 'Writing R Extensions' documents macros MAYBE_REFERENCED,
      MAYBE_SHARED and MARK_NOT_MUTABLE that should be used by package
      C code instead NAMED or SET_NAMED.

    * The object header layout has been changed to support merging the
      ALTREP branch. This requires re-installing packages that use
      compiled code.

    * 'Writing R Extensions' now documents the R_tryCatch,
      R_tryCatchError, and R_UnwindProtect functions.

    * NAMEDMAX has been raised to 3 to allow protection of intermediate
      results from (usually ill-advised) assignments in arguments to
      BUILTIN functions. Package C code using SET_NAMED may need to be
      revised.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * Sys.timezone(location = FALSE) is defunct, and is ignored (with a
      warning).

    * methods:::bind_activation() is defunct now; it typically has been
      unneeded for years.

      The undocumented 'hidden' objects .__H__.cbind and .__H__.rbind
      in package base are deprecated (in favour of cbind and rbind).

    * The declaration of pythag() in Rmath.h has been removed - the
      entry point has not been provided since R 2.14.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * printCoefmat() now also works without column names.

    * The S4 methods on Ops() for the "structure" class no longer cause
      infinite recursion when the structure is not an S4 object.

    * nlm(f, ..) for the case where f() has a "hessian" attribute now
      computes LL' = H + uI correctly.  (PR#17249).

    * An S4 method that "rematches" to its generic and overrides the
      default value of a generic formal argument to NULL no longer
      drops the argument from its formals.

    * Rscript can now accept more than one argument given on the #!
      line of a script. Previously, one could only pass a single
      argument on the #! line in Linux.

    * Connections are now written correctly with encoding "UTF-16LE".
      (PR#16737).

    * Evaluation of ..0 now signals an error.  When ..1 is used and ...
      is empty, the error message is more appropriate.

    * (Windows mainly.)  Unicode code points which require surrogate
      pairs in UTF-16 are now handled.  All systems should properly
      handle surrogate pairs, even those systems that do not need to
      make use of them.  (PR#16098)

    * stopifnot(e, e2, ...) now evaluates the expressions sequentially
      and in case of an error or warning shows the relevant expression
      instead of the full stopifnot(..)  call.

    * path.expand() on Windows now accepts paths specified as
      UTF-8-encoded character strings even if not representable in the
      current locale.  (PR#17120)

    * line(x, y) now correctly computes the medians of the left and
      right group's x-values and in all cases reproduces straight
      lines.

    * Extending S4 classes with slots corresponding to special
      attributes like dim and dimnames now works.

    * Fix for legend() when fill has multiple values the first of which
      is NA (all colours used to default to par(fg)).  (PR#17288)

    * installed.packages() did not remove the cached value for a
      library tree that had been emptied (but would not use the old
      value, just waste time checking it).

    * The documentation for installed.packages(noCache = TRUE)
      incorrectly claimed it would refresh the cache.

    * aggregate(<data.frame>) no longer uses spurious names in some
      cases.  (PR#17283)

    * object.size() now also works for long vectors.

    * packageDescription() tries harder to solve re-encoding issues,
      notably seen in some Windows locales.  This fixes the citation()
      issue in PR#17291.

    * poly(<matrix>, 3) now works, thanks to prompting by Marc
      Schwartz.

    * readLines() no longer segfaults on very large files with embedded
      '\0' (aka 'nul') characters.  (PR#17311)

    * ns() (package splines) now also works for a single observation.
      interpSpline() gives a more friendly error message when the
      number of points is less than four.

    * dist(x, method = "canberra") now uses the correct definition; the
      result may only differ when x contains values of differing signs,
      e.g. not for 0-1 data.

    * methods:::cbind() and methods:::rbind() avoid deep recursion,
      thanks to Suharto Anggono via PR#17300.

    * Arithmetic with zero-column data frames now works more
      consistently; issue raised by Bill Dunlap.

      Arithmetic with data frames gives a data frame for ^ (which
      previously gave a numeric matrix).

    * pretty(x, n) for large n or large diff(range(x)) now works better
      (though it was never meant for large n); internally it uses the
      same rounding fuzz (1e-10) as seq.default() - as it did up to
      2010-02-03 when both were 1e-7.

    * Internal C-level R_check_class_and_super() and hence
      R_check_class_etc() now also consider non-direct super classes
      and hence return a match in more cases.  This e.g., fixes
      behaviour of derived classes in package Matrix.

    * Reverted unintended change in behavior of return calls in on.exit
      expressions introduced by stack unwinding changes in R 3.3.0.

    * Attributes on symbols are now detected and prevented; attempt to
      add an attribute to a symbol results in an error.

    * fisher.test(*, workspace = <n>) now may also increase the
      internal stack size which allows larger problem to be solved,
      fixing PR#1662.

    * The methods package no longer directly copies slots (attributes)
      into a prototype that is of an "abnormal" (reference) type, like
      a symbol.

    * The methods package no longer attempts to call length<-() on NULL
      (during the bootstrap process).

    * The methods package correctly shows methods when there are
      multiple methods with the same signature for the same generic
      (still not fully supported, but at least the user can see them).

    * sys.on.exit() is now always evaluated in the right frame. (From
      Lionel Henry.)

    * seq.POSIXt(*, by = "<n> DSTdays") now should work correctly in
      all cases and is faster.  (PR#17342)

    * .C() when returning a logical vector now always maps values other
      than FALSE and NA to TRUE (as documented).

    * Subassignment with zero length vectors now coerces as documented
      (PR#17344).
      Further, x <- numeric(); x[1] <- character() now signals an error
      'replacement has length zero' (or a translation of that) instead
      of doing nothing.

    * (Package parallel.)  mclapply(), pvec() and mcparallel() (when
      mccollect() is used to collect results) no longer leave zombie
      processes behind.

    * R CMD INSTALL <pkg> now produces the intended error message when,
      e.g., the LazyData field is invalid.

    * as.matrix(dd) now works when the data frame dd contains a column
      which is a data frame or matrix, including a 0-column matrix/d.f.
      .

    * mclapply(X, mc.cores) now follows its documentation and calls
      lapply() in case mc.cores = 1 also in the case mc.preschedule is
      false.  (PR#17373)

    * aggregate(<data.frame>, drop=FALSE) no longer calls the function
      on <empty> parts but sets corresponding results to NA.  (Thanks
      to Suharto Anggono's patches in PR#17280).

    * The duplicated() method for data frames is now based on the list
      method (instead of string coercion).  Consequently unique() is
      better distinguishing data frame rows, fixing PR#17369 and
      PR#17381.  The methods for matrices and arrays are changed
      accordingly.

    * Calling names() on an S4 object derived from "environment"
      behaves (by default) like calling names() on an ordinary
      environment.

    * read.table() with a non-default separator now supports quotes
      following a non-whitespace character, matching the behavior of
      scan().

    * parLapplyLB and parSapplyLB have been fixed to do load balancing
      (dynamic scheduling).  This also means that results of
      computations depending on random number generators will now
      really be non-reproducible, as documented.

    * Indexing a list using dollar and empty string (l$"") returns
      NULL.

    * Using \usage{ data(<name>, package="<pkg>") } no longer produces
      R CMD check warnings.

    * match.arg() more carefully chooses the environment for
      constructing default choices, fixing PR#17401 as proposed by
      Duncan Murdoch.

    * Deparsing of consecutive ! calls is now consistent with deparsing
      unary - and + calls and creates code that can be reparsed
      exactly; thanks to a patch by Lionel Henry in PR#17397.  (As a
      side effect, this uses fewer parentheses in some other deparsing
      involving ! calls.)

Hi

With
> which(colSums(m4)==0)

you get column numbers with only zeroes.

You could also remove zero column by.

m4[,colSums(m4)!=0]

And with that you could find colums with ones.
which(colSums(m4)==nrow(m4))
[1] 10001
Cheers
Petr

Hi,

Your attempt didn't work because you didn't do what I suggested, which
was make sure that your data frame matched the example given in the
help for gantt.chart.

Here's what you have:
> str(cdfg)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ c1d1: Factor w/ 3 levels "task 1","task 3",..: 1 3 2
 $ c2d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-01" "2018-04-15" ...
 $ c3d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-15" "2018-05-31" ...


Here's what you should have (constructed from the example in the help file):
> str(gantt.info)
List of 4
 $ labels    : chr [1:5] "First task" "Second task" "Third task"
"Fourth task" ...
 $ starts    : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-01-01" "2004-02-02" ...
 $ ends      : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-03-03" "2004-05-05" ...
 $ priorities: num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5

You got the dates into the correct format, but the names of the list
elements (columns) do not match, and your data.frame() call turned the
labels from character into factor while you weren't looking.

gantt.chart() has no idea what you're talking about, because it is
looking for particular names.

If you fix those problems, it works fine.

colnames(cdfg) <- c("labels", "starts", "ends")
cdfg$labels <- as.character(cdfg$labels)

gantt.chart(cdfg)

Hi Sarah

Sorry for the delay in responding.

Based on your earlier message I realized that the way I was reading in the data was causing this problem. I also realized that my attempt at fixing the problem (by selecting each of the columns using the $ operator and then changing it to the appropriate format) was not helping and is very clunky.

So, I did this:

abc <- read.csv("gntr1a.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, colClasses=c("character","POSIXct","POSIXct","integer"))

and this works (I think it is important to make sure the columns in the spreadsheet are named  "starts", "ends" , etc. before exporting in order for this to work).

So, once again thank you (and also Jim and David).

Regards
Indr

Hi,

Your attempt didn't work because you didn't do what I suggested, which
was make sure that your data frame matched the example given in the
help for gantt.chart.

Here's what you have:
> str(cdfg)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ c1d1: Factor w/ 3 levels "task 1","task 3",..: 1 3 2
 $ c2d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-01" "2018-04-15" ...
 $ c3d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-15" "2018-05-31" ...


Here's what you should have (constructed from the example in the help file):
> str(gantt.info)
List of 4
 $ labels    : chr [1:5] "First task" "Second task" "Third task"
"Fourth task" ...
 $ starts    : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-01-01" "2004-02-02" ...
 $ ends      : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-03-03" "2004-05-05" ...
 $ priorities: num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5

You got the dates into the correct format, but the names of the list
elements (columns) do not match, and your data.frame() call turned the
labels from character into factor while you weren't looking.

gantt.chart() has no idea what you're talking about, because it is
looking for particular names.

If you fix those problems, it works fine.

colnames(cdfg) <- c("labels", "starts", "ends")
cdfg$labels <- as.character(cdfg$labels)

gantt.chart(cdfg)

Hi

I think the subsetting works by giving you the panels for the 
corresponding levels of the conditioning variable(s).  Note that, if 
there is more than one conditioning variable, you will need more than 
one subsetting index.

For example, taking this plot with two conditioning variables and 12 
panels in total ...

dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley)

... this produces three pages ...

dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
         layout=c(2,2))

... and this produces the second page (both panels for the first 
conditioning variable and the third and fourth panels for the second 
conditioning variable) ...

dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
         layout=c(2,2))[1:2, 3:4]

Hope that helps

Paul

Hmm.  Thanks Paul.  I may be able to work with that.  But what I really 
wanted was to take

     bar <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley)

and then do (something like)

     foo <- bar[<something>]

so that foo contains only the second page of bar, and then do print(foo)
to get a plot of (just) the second page.  Without re-issuing a 
(modified) plot command.

Is that not at all possible?

cheers,

Rolf.

Subject: [R] How to visualise what code is processed within a for loop
Message-ID: <CABQyo86wj28fFqhAUVDjhjRbCka0kc5SzwxZ_=Bpe7QdQMjfcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to debug the following code:

for (i in 1:10){
  t <- paste("d0$V",i,sep="")
  t <- ifelse(regexpr(d1[i,1],d0$X0)>0,1,0)
}

and I would like to see what code is actually processing R, how can I do
that?

More to the point, I am trying to update my variables d0$V1 to d0$V10
according to the presence or absence of some text (contained in the file
d1) within the d0$X0 variable.

The code seem to run ok, if I add print(table(t)) within the loop I can see
that the ifelse procedure is working and to some cases within the d0$V1 to
d0$V10 variable range a 1 is assigned. But when checking my d0$V1 to d0$V10
after the for loop they are all still equal to zero...

Thanks,

Luca

The loop never assigns anything to d0, only t. The first line makes t
a character string "d0$V1" (or "d0$V2" etc.). The second line assigns
either 0 or 1 to t.

Looking at this, I don't think you've got into the R psychology (bad
news if you want to use R, good news in many other ways). I assume d0
is a list, so could you put the V's into a vector, and then just use
this:

d0$V <- sapply(d1[1:10,1], grepl, d0$X0)

(I haven't checked it, but it looks,like it will do the trick. It
returns a logical vector, so if you need integers, then use an
as.numeric() around the right hand side. Or hope that R does type
conversion for you when you need it)

Hi everybody,

How can I get text from RScript (e.g. syntax, reminder) into the result
text.
Sink() does not do that - I only read the results and therefore I have to
'guess' which syntax was used where - reminders I wrote are lost.

Bw and thank you in advance,

Hi Bob,

Thank you for your suggestion. Actually d0 is a dataframe, does that change
something in the code you propose?

Hi Rolf

do you need to use the  layout argument?

The layout is conditioned by the levels of a or unique values if not a factor. easier with factor

unique(dta$a)
 [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l"
data.frame( a= unique(dta$a), page = rep(1:3, ea = 4), col = 1:2,row  = rep(1:2, ea = 2))
   a page col row
1  a    1   1   1
2  b    1   2   1
3  c    1   1   2
4  d    1   2   2
5  e    2   1   1
6  f    2   2   1
7  g    2   1   2
8  h    2   2   2
9  i    3   1   1
10 j    3   2   1
11 k    3   1   2
12 l    3   2   2

I hope I have got the order right

full dataset
xyplot(y~x|a,data=dta)


     bar  = xyplot(y~x|a,data = subset(dta, a %in% c("e","f","g","h")) ))

print(bar)
(missed the dotplot requirement) but principle is the same.

you can use packet.number or which.packet if needed to make it simpler

use par.settings to do colours lines etc as well as spacing.

Hmm.  Thanks Paul.  I may be able to work with that.  But what I really 
wanted was to take

     bar <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley)

and then do (something like)

     foo <- bar[<something>]

so that foo contains only the second page of bar, and then do print(foo)
to get a plot of (just) the second page.  Without re-issuing a 
(modified) plot command.

Is that not at all possible?

cheers,

Rolf.

function. The difference appears related to the predicted means used in 
the Tukey posthoc test. The glht function uses the marginal means, which 
I can obtain using the effect function in the 'effects' package.? 
TukeyHSD generates the means using the model.tables function.? Per the 
help file, "the implementation is incomplete, and only simpler cases 
have been tested thoroughly". Does this mean that TukeyHSD shouldn't be 
used when covariates are included in the model? Could anyone elaborate 
on why the model.tables function is generating means that differ from 
the effect function?? Thanks...

Subject: [R] Rolling window difference for zoo time series
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJmC=iuGxbuKQyP8OYDWg2k5A1EoHgyVCiUuBFphOdfhvw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a 'zoo' time series as below :

Zoo_TS = zoo(5:1, as.Date(Sys.time())+0:4)

Now I want to calculate First order difference of order 1, rolling
window basis i.e.

(Zoo_TS[2] - Zoo_TS[1] ) / Zoo_TS[1]
(Zoo_TS[3] - Zoo_TS[2] ) / Zoo_TS[2]
.....

Is there any direct function available to achieve this?

Thanks,

Look at the spin and stitch functions in the knitr package if you want
to process an existing script into an output that mixes the code run
with the output.

Look at the txtStart and related functions in the TeachingDemos
package if you want the code and output saved in a file from a session
where you are typing in commands.

If in general you want text, code, and output mixed, learn the knitr
and/or rmarkdown packages for how to write a file that can be
processed into a report.  Also consider learning about RStudio
notebook documents where you can have the output mixed into the
"script" file.

Subject: [R] Can't Get Lattice Histogram Minor Tick Marks to Work
Message-ID: <004a01d3dc44$9d309510$d791bf30$@matstat.com>

I'm drawing a paneled histogram using the lattice package. I've succeeded in
adding minor tick marks to the vertical axis, but I can't get the desired
number of minor tick marks between the major tick marks. 

I've attached a self-contained program to illustrate the problem.

Thanks Jeff, 

I attached a file with the program to my earlier email because the posting guide seemed to imply that non-binary attachments would work. But I see that the file was stripped off. 

I installed the program file on a web site, but when I downloaded it, the line breaks were stripped out. So I've included the program below:

-------------------------------------------------------

# This R program illustrates a problem with the histogram function in 
# the lattice package.
# This program requires the  latticeExtra  package to be installed to
# generate the minor tickmarks.

library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)  

# First, please run the program to see the problem.

# Note how the histogram shows minor tickmarks on the vertical axis. 
# I would like to show only a SINGLE minor tickmark between major tickmarks on
# the vertical axis, which helps to show the viewer that all the bars
# in the left panel are at five percent.

# The yscale.components.subticks function in the latticeExtras package
# has arguments to contol the minor tickmarks, but I can't get them to work.
# How can a get a single minor tickmark between the major tickmarks on
# the vertical axis?

# Thanks for your help,

# Don Macnaughton donmac at matstat.com


# Generate data in an 20 x 2 matrix for left panel. In my real application 
# the data file contains many more rows, but that's not necessary here.
for (i in 1:20) {
    if (i == 1) {pmat = c(0.045,0)} else {
                 pmat = rbind(pmat,c(i*0.05-0.001,0))}
                }

# Generate data for the right panel in the same matrix.
counts = c(90, 12.5, 9, 8, 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 
           4, 3.5, 3, 2.8, 2.2, 2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.0)
for (i in 1:20) {
    maxCount = 100 * counts[i]
    for (j in 1:maxCount){
    pmat = rbind( pmat, c(i*0.05-0.001,2) )
                         }
                }

# Convert the matrix to a data frame and add column names.
pDat = data.frame(pmat)
colnames(pDat) = c("pValue","nonCent")


# Create a factor to enable titles on the two panels.
nonCent.f = factor(pDat$nonCent, 
  labels=c("Noncentrality = 0.0", "Noncentrality = 2.0"))

# Use the lattice histogram function to draw the histogram.
histogram( ~ pValue | nonCent.f, data = pDat, nint = 20,
   endpoints = c(0, 1), layout = c(2,1), 
   yscale.components=yscale.components.subticks,
   scales=list(alternating=FALSE,tck=c(1,0)),
   col="lightgray")

Hi

You may need to make a custom function for yscale.components; I think there
is an example in the help guides
Also have a look at
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-June/134524.html

Thanks Jeff, 

I attached a file with the program to my earlier email because the posting
guide seemed to imply that non-binary attachments would work. But I see that
the file was stripped off. 

I installed the program file on a web site, but when I downloaded it, the
line breaks were stripped out. So I've included the program below:

-------------------------------------------------------

# This R program illustrates a problem with the histogram function in 
# the lattice package.
# This program requires the  latticeExtra  package to be installed to
# generate the minor tickmarks.

library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)  

# First, please run the program to see the problem.

# Note how the histogram shows minor tickmarks on the vertical axis. 
# I would like to show only a SINGLE minor tickmark between major tickmarks
on
# the vertical axis, which helps to show the viewer that all the bars
# in the left panel are at five percent.

# The yscale.components.subticks function in the latticeExtras package
# has arguments to contol the minor tickmarks, but I can't get them to work.
# How can a get a single minor tickmark between the major tickmarks on

                 pmat = rbind(pmat,c(i*0.05-0.001,0))}
                }

# Generate data for the right panel in the same matrix.
counts = c(90, 12.5, 9, 8, 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 
           4, 3.5, 3, 2.8, 2.2, 2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.0)
for (i in 1:20) {
    maxCount = 100 * counts[i]
    for (j in 1:maxCount){
    pmat = rbind( pmat, c(i*0.05-0.001,2) )
                         }
                }

# Convert the matrix to a data frame and add column names.
pDat = data.frame(pmat)
colnames(pDat) = c("pValue","nonCent")


# Create a factor to enable titles on the two panels.
nonCent.f = factor(pDat$nonCent, 
  labels=c("Noncentrality = 0.0", "Noncentrality = 2.0"))

# Use the lattice histogram function to draw the histogram.

Subject: [R] Fitting survival trees with competing risk
Message-ID: <000001d3dc71$4df76370$e9e62a50$@unina.it>

Dear all,

 

I'm interested in fitting survival trees with competing risk analysis.

The tree should show the cumulative incidence function for each terminal
node .

 

I read several paper illustrating this possibility, but to the best of my
knowledge no R code are reported.

 

There is any R package for this fit?

 

Thank you very much in advance.

Thanks Jeff, 

I attached a file with the program to my earlier email because the posting guide seemed to imply that non-binary attachments would work. But I see that the file was stripped off. 

Restating the problem:

I'm drawing a paneled histogram using the lattice package. I've succeeded in adding minor tick marks to the vertical axis, but I can't get the desired number of minor tick marks between the major tick marks.

I installed the program file on a web site, but when I downloaded it, the line breaks were stripped out. So I've included the program below:

Subject: [R] How to visualise what code is processed within a for loop
In-Reply-To: <CABQyo86wj28fFqhAUVDjhjRbCka0kc5SzwxZ_=Bpe7QdQMjfcw@mail.gmail.com>

Your code doesn't make sense to me in a couple of ways.

Inside the loop, the first line assigns a value to an object named "t".
Then, the second line does the same thing, assigns a value to an object named "t".

The value of the object named "t" after the second line will be the output of the ifelse() expression, whatever that is. This has the effect of making the first line irrelevant. Whatever value t has after the first line is replaced by whatever it gets from the second line.

It looks like the first line inside the loop is constructing the name of a data frame column, and storing that name as a character string. However, the second line doesn't use that name at all. If your goal is to update the contents of a column, you need to assign something to that column in the next line. Instead you assign it to the object named "t".

What you're looking for will be more along the lines of this:

    for (i in 1:10){
      nm <- paste0("V", i)
      d0[[nm]] <- ifelse( regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0, 1, 0)
    }

This may not a complete solution, since I have no idea what the contents or structure of d1 are, or what the regexpr() is expected to return.

And notice the use of double brackets, [[ and ]]. This is one way to reference a column of a  data frame when you have the column's name stored in a variable. Another way is d0[ , nm]


A couple of additional comments:

 "t" is a poor choice of object name, because it is one of R's built-in functions (immediately after starting a fresh session of R, with nothing left over from any previous session, type help("r") and see what you get).

 ifelse() is intended for use on vectors, not scalars, and it looks like maybe you're using it on a scalar (can't be sure about this, though)

For example, ifelse() is designed for this kind of usage:
> ifelse( c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) , 1:3, 11:13)
[1]  1 12  3

Although it works ok for these
> ifelse(TRUE, 3, 4)
[1] 3
> ifelse(FALSE, 3, 4)
[1] 4
They are not really what it is intended for.

    and I would like to see what code is actually processing R, how can I do
    that?
    
    More to the point, I am trying to update my variables d0$V1 to d0$V10
    according to the presence or absence of some text (contained in the file
    d1) within the d0$X0 variable.
    
    The code seem to run ok, if I add print(table(t)) within the loop I can see
    that the ifelse procedure is working and to some cases within the d0$V1 to
    d0$V10 variable range a 1 is assigned. But when checking my d0$V1 to d0$V10
    after the for loop they are all still equal to zero...

Message-ID: <CACLgfx333+FT9HYn2LbzaTBGhaCYQkaoM_5XRK3kQMg3E7N4Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir,

I am using R on Windows OS platform. I upgraded my R-system to version
R-3.5.0. While upgrading my libraries in R as well as in RStudio, I am
stuck up in the package 'data.table', which is required by many other
packages in R-codes in my R-Markdown files.

I tried to install 'data.table' from "USA-berkely" and "UK-bristol"  as
well as "RStudio" mirrors when the following errors are being shown:

From  USA-berkely and UK-bristol mirrors:
=================================

  compilation of C/C++/Fortran: ?data.table?

From RStudio mirror:
================
Package which is only available in source form, and may need compilation of
  C/C++/Fortran: ?data.table?
  These will not be installed

Afterwards, I consulted google users, I downloaded the source package:
"data.table_1.10.4-3.tar.gz" from CRAN, stored it on desktop, and tried
following command for installing from source only:


install.packages("C:\\Users\\Dr. A.K.

This generated following errors messages:

I build binary data files into a library by placing the .rda files at the proper \data sub-folder before building the library with the following procedure:
1. File -> Open project
2. Build -> Build binary packages.
This has worked up to 3 .rda files.

Now, I add another .rda file to the folder. I received a very strange, seemingly unrelated warning message that says:

Warning: object '.Random.seed' is created by more than one data call

The weird thing about this is, repeating the procedure, I sometime can access the data file from the library (i.e., by data(filename)), other time I cannot access the data file. The data file is big but not so big (571 KB).

Any clues? Why am I getting that warning message?

Dear All,
apologies if this is basic: I am writing a function:

fb<-function(mean, median, mode, a, b=0.95, lower=F)
{....}

The arguments mean, median and mode are mutually exclusive (i.e. the user
should define only one of these). How do I code this within the function?

Thanks,

Dear A.K. Singh,

As you discovered, the data.table package has an error under R 3.5.0 that prevents CRAN from distributing a Windows binary for the package. The reason that you weren't able to install the package from source is apparently that you haven't installed the R package-building tools for Windows. See <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

Because a number of users of my Rcmdr and car packages have contacted me with a similar issue, as a temporary work-around I've placed a Windows binary for the data.table package on my website at <https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/.Pickup/data.table_1.10.4-3.zip>. You should be able to install the package from there via the command

	install.packages("https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/.Pickup/data.table_1.10.4-3.zip", repos=NULL, type="win.binary")

I expect that this problem will go away when the maintainer of the data.table package fixes the error.

I hope this helps,
 John

You can see the errors in the package on this web page:

https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_data.table.html

Currently it is failing self-tests on all platforms except r-oldrel, 
which is the previous release of R.  I'd recommend backing out of R 
3.5.0 and going to R 3.4.4 if that's a possibility for you.

Yet another possibility is to use a version of data.table from Github, 
which is newer than the version on CRAN and may have fixed the errors, 
but that would require an installation from source, which not every 
Windows user is comfortable with.

Dear Duncan,

I think that your advice to downgrade may make sense if A. K. Singh actually needs to use data.table. In the case of the car package, for example, which depends on data.table indirectly via the rio package, data.table never gets used. As well, the examples and vignettes in data.table appear to work under R 2.5.0, so it's possible that (much of) the functionality of the package is intact.

Best,
 John

Here is some unsolicited advice:  I would strongly recommend that you 
make it a higher priority to have backups available.  In my experience 
computer hardware is becoming quite reliable, but software isn't, and 
the person next to the keyboard isn't either.  (My last desperate need 
for a backup was due to a hardware failure 2 years ago, but it wasn't 
the manufacturer's fault:  my laptop accidentally drowned.)

Backups can save you a lot of grief in the event of a mistake, or a 
software or hardware failure.  But even in the case of routine events 
like software updates that don't go as planned, they can save time.

I'm guessing you don't have the proper Rtools installation for 3.5:

You can see the errors in the package on this web page:

https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_data.table.html

Currently it is failing self-tests on all platforms except r-oldrel,
which is the previous release of R.  I'd recommend backing out of R
3.5.0 and going to R 3.4.4 if that's a possibility for you.

Yet another possibility is to use a version of data.table from Github,
which is newer than the version on CRAN and may have fixed the errors,
but that would require an installation from source, which not every
Windows user is comfortable with.

You are right. I do take backups. But, this time I was too sure that
nothing will go wrong. But, this was over-confidence. I need to take more
care in future. Thanks anyway.

If you're installing packages to the default location in your home
account and you didn't remove those library folders, you still have
you R 3.4 package installs there, e.g.

> dir(dirname(.libPaths()[1]), full.names = TRUE)
[1] "/home/hb/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4"

Hello,

I downloaded your .rar-file and looked through your R-code. You should 
revise your script. Specifically, start by looking at what data set you 
are referring to when training your knn-model: you never create the object 
"modeldata".

Best of luck.

Hi

Does this not do what you want ... ?

allpages <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
                     layout=c(2,2))
page2 <- allpages[1:2, 3:4]
print(page2)

Hmm, looks like that thread has more noise than signal...

AFAICT, data.table currently fails selftests i 3.5.0 on all platforms on the CRAN builders, so RTools issues are only incidental and it would be better to fix data.table in the sources. 

From the looks of it, I wouldn't be surprised if the root cause is the changes to POSIXlt methods in 3.5.0, but I haven't actually been digging in to check that.

Yes. Using Rtools to install the package from source or installing the binary I provided is just a band-aid that allows packages with dependencies on data.table (direct or indirect) to load.

Dear Akhilesh,

I hope that it's clear that the Windows binary I provided for the data.table package is a temporary solution, and that the maintainer should fix the package so that it passes its own tests. You should be careful using the package in its current state.

Best,
 John

Akhilesh,

I don't know if I am adding signal or noise here, but I installed R 3.5.0 yesterday and installed data.table just fine, but I have Rtools installed.  "Building packages from source" may sound intimidating, but Rtools is really easy to install and once installed, it does all the work for you.

Thanks,

Roger

Subject: [R] about combining analysis results using package 'flexmix' and '
 mice'
Message-ID: <CAN_1JwRxx+7+DiE7HYjf0NV9Oqnfbb89=7U1mD6+9LW4Ms1j+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently using package ?mice? to do multiple imputation for tourist
data here. Then the  complete datasets (e.g. m>= 100)  will be analyzed
with a finite mixture model using package ?flexmix?. I have found that it
seems no feasible way to combine the multiple results into a final one
smoothly using just a few commands. By the way I have seen that package
like ?semTools? has such function to combine the ?within variance? and ?
between variance? for the estimated parameters, but it applies for SEM
models only. Do you have some recommendations about the combinations of
results after ?mice? and ? flexmix? packages if available? Thank you very
much.


Sincerely

Wei

I agree, subject to a couple of caveats.

1.  There are apparently instructions online that somehow mess up the 
installation of Rtools, putting it in a location that doesn't work 
without other changes that aren't described.  If people just run the 
installer and accept the defaults, it works.  Don't trust bloggers, 
trust CRAN.

2.  data.table fails its self-tests in 3.5.0, as shown on CRAN. 
Apparently fixes are in the works, but being able to install it doesn't 
mean it will work properly.

Hi Paul, Rolf

I do not know how legal this is but this works if you have spaces around the ultimate plot due to changes in layout
Changing the layout parameters removes the unwanted space.

ap = dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,layout = c(2,6))
apm = ap[1:2,3:4]
apm$layout <- c(2,2)
apm

Hi

Does this not do what you want ... ?

allpages <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
                     layout=c(2,2))
page2 <- allpages[1:2, 3:4]

Thanks Don,

    for (i in 1:10){
      nm <- paste0("V", i)
      d0[[nm]] <- ifelse( regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0, 1, 0)
    }

is exaclty what I needed.

Hello,

instead of ifelse, the following is exactly the same and much more 
efficient.

d0[[nm]] <- as.integer(regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0)


Hope this helps,

I forgot to explain why my suggestion.

The logical condition returns FALSE/TRUE that in R are coded as 0/1.
So all you have to do is coerce to integer.

This works because the ifelse will return a 1 or a 0 depending on the 
condition. Meaning exactly the same values. And is more efficient since 
ifelse creates both vectors, the true part and the false part, and then 
indexes those vectors in order to return the appropriate values. This is 
the double of the trouble and a great deal of memory used.

Subject: [R] Compare global and between group variability of 2 mixed effect
 models
Message-ID: <CALcwahOUiutiQNXPz-okHTBn-fxKbSH-HF=A4b3Z9Pa+NYpTZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We are comparing some features of our product against a competitor. Since
the product is produced in lots and we have proof that ambient temperature
is relevant for its functioning we used a mixed effect model (MEM)
structured this way (NB: R lme4 notation):

`out ~ Brand * Temperature + (Temperature | Lot)`

with out being the various outcomes, a random intercept on Lot and a random
slope on Temperature.

We need to understand which brand has more variability between single items
and between lots.

We thought of using the random intercept and residual standard deviations
from the MEM for each brand. The problem now is how to compare them.

We tried using the F distribution to build confidence intervals and
hypothesis test, but for most of the outcomes we evaluated, one or both
models had zero standard deviation on the random intercept, so it's
impossible to take the ratio (lots of zeros, infinity, NaN).

We investigated also the variance gamma distribution, that can describe the
difference of two standard deviations (so zeros are not a problem), but we
don't actually know how to pass the right parameters to describe our data.

As a third alternative, we tried modeling the ratio between standard
deviations with a bayes-regularized glm model with Poisson links:

`bayesglm(c(sd1, sd2) ~ c('mod1', 'mod2), weights = c(n1, n2), family =
poisson())

But we are not sure whether it could be a meaningful approximation or not.
We thought of a Poisson distribution because it can natively cope with
zeros and the bayes regularization to avoid too extreme estimates (eg: 0 -
Inf confidence intervals).

Finally, we thought of a much simpler approach:
- first use a Levene test to compare raw variances between brands.
- than using ANOVA to test for between-lots variability for each brand.

Although much simpler, this methodology don?t use the information on the
clustered structure of the data and the effect of temperature. Furthermore,
it doesn't formally compare between-lots variability between brands, it
just produce two F scores.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

Subject: [R] Overlay line on a bar plot - multiple axis
Message-ID: <CAMLwc7NP++Fq4bPHSN4iR2Ei_7wB0ojT0KjDfgryOKUuxM3OCA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to make a similar plot -
https://peltiertech.com/images/2013-09/BarLineSampleChart4.png.

I have data for two variables; count and z by city and week. I would like
to have a horizontal bar plot of *count* by city and a line plot of weekly
average of the variable *z*.

I have tried the following:

ggplot() + geom_bar(data=dat, aes(x=city, y=count),
stat="identity",position="dodge") + coord_flip() +
geom_line(data=dat, aes(x=week, y=mean_tmin))

However, this flips the code for both the bar plot and the line plot. I
would the y-axis of the line plot to be on the left-vertical axis. I read
that it is difficult to have a secondary axis with ggplot. Any help will be
highly appreciated. Thank you!

dput(dat)
structure(list(city = structure(c(4L, 5L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 4L, 3L,
1L, 2L, 5L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 4L, 5L), .Label = c("Akron", "Boston",

Hi Miluji,
You have a problem as the x-axis is different for the two plots.
However, the y-axis can be the same, so you really don't need
different axes. I think you want to display city within week. The
example below shows how to display both the counts for the cities by
week, the mean z by week and then use legends to identify the
different parts of the plot. I'm afraid that I didn't even try to do
this in ggplot.

# this uses your structure "dat"
weekcity<-dat[order(dat$week,dat$city),1:4]
barpos<-barplot(matrix(weekcity$count,nrow=5),names.arg=1:3,
 legend.text=c("Akron","Boston","Houston","NYC","OKC"),
 args.legend=list(x=8,y=6),xlab="count",
 ylab="Week",beside=TRUE,horiz=TRUE)
lines(by(weekcity$z,weekcity$week,mean),colMeans(barpos),
 type="b",lwd=2)
legend(5.5,16,"Weekly mean of z",pch=1,lty=1,lwd=2)

Hi Miluji,

Using Jim's interpretation of your desired graph,
you could do it in ggplot2 using your dat DF by:

ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data=dat,
    aes(x=week,y=count,fill=city),stat="identity",position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_line(data=dat, aes(x=week, y=mean_tmin))

There would still need some work to be done to get the weekly mean
into a legend, but it is achievable if required.

Ron.

Hi Rui

Thank you for your suggestion,

I have tested the code suggested by you against that supplied by Don in
terms of timing and results are very much aligned: to populate a 5954x899
0/1 matrix on my machine your procedure took 79 secs, while the one with
ifelse employed 80 secs, hence unfortunately not really any significant
time saved there.

Nevertheless thank you for your contribution.

Kind regards,

Luca

Luca,

If speed is important, you might improve performance by making d0 into a true matrix, rather than a data frame (assuming d0 is indeed a data frame at this point). Although data frames may look like matrices, they aren?t, and they have some overhead that matrices don?t.  I don?t think you would be able to use the [[nm]] syntax with a matrix, but [ , nm] should work, provided the matrix has column names. Or you could perhaps index by column number.

I had a project some years ago in which I reduced calculation time a lot by extracting the numeric columns of a data frame and working with them, then recombining them with the character columns. R?s performance working with data frames has improved since then, so I really don?t know if it would make a difference for your task.

I forgot to explain why my suggestion.

The logical condition returns FALSE/TRUE that in R are coded as 0/1.
So all you have to do is coerce to integer.

This works because the ifelse will return a 1 or a 0 depending on the condition. Meaning exactly the same values. And is more efficient since ifelse creates both vectors, the true part and the false part, and then indexes those vectors in order to return the appropriate values. This is the double of the trouble and a great deal of memory used.

Your code doesn't make sense to me in a couple of ways.

Inside the loop, the first line assigns a value to an object named "t".
Then, the second line does the same thing, assigns a value to an object
named "t".

The value of the object named "t" after the second line will be the output
of the ifelse() expression, whatever that is. This has the effect of making
the first line irrelevant. Whatever value t has after the first line is
replaced by whatever it gets from the second line.

It looks like the first line inside the loop is constructing the name of a
data frame column, and storing that name as a character string. However,
the second line doesn't use that name at all. If your goal is to update the
contents of a column, you need to assign something to that column in the
next line. Instead you assign it to the object named "t".

What you're looking for will be more along the lines of this:

     for (i in 1:10){
       nm <- paste0("V", i)
       d0[[nm]] <- ifelse( regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0, 1, 0)
     }

This may not a complete solution, since I have no idea what the contents
or structure of d1 are, or what the regexpr() is expected to return.

And notice the use of double brackets, [[ and ]]. This is one way to
reference a column of a  data frame when you have the column's name stored
in a variable. Another way is d0[ , nm]


A couple of additional comments:

  "t" is a poor choice of object name, because it is one of R's built-in
functions (immediately after starting a fresh session of R, with nothing
left over from any previous session, type help("r") and see what you get).

  ifelse() is intended for use on vectors, not scalars, and it looks like
maybe you're using it on a scalar (can't be sure about this, though)

For example, ifelse() is designed for this kind of usage:
ifelse( c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) , 1:3, 11:13)
[1]  1 12  3

Although it works ok for these
ifelse(TRUE, 3, 4)
[1] 3
ifelse(FALSE, 3, 4)
[1] 4
They are not really what it is intended for.

Hello,

Another thing to note is that regexpr is likely to take (much) more time 
than ifelse or as.integer.
And the code will therefore not be very optimizable.

Thank you for both replies Don & Rui,

The very issue here is that there is a search that needs to be done within
a text field and I agree with Rui later comment that regexpr might indeed
be the time consuming piece of code.

I might try to optimise this piece of code later on, but for the time being
I am working on the following part of building a neural network to try
indeed classifying some text.

Again, thanks,

Luca

"I am working on the following part of building a neural network to try
indeed classifying some text."

... and so you are most likely trying to reinvent wheels. There are
already many such tools available here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html

Some of these are interfaces to C language code, and so are probably
much more efficient than anything you (or I) can do at the R level.

Of course, if this is mainly a programming exercise for you, than this
is largely irrelevant.

Cheers,
Bert

Message-ID: <CAMM2pDo69mL2=w4GwWe=k7xHpHKwffMwLQuP90Uk+3ufxqOqVw@mail.gmail.com>

Is Rtools 3.4 or 3.5 the recommended version for to go along with R 3.5.0?

The reason I ask is our corporate IT upgraded our systems to R 3.5.0
but does not *want* to upgrade Rtools to 3.5 since it is not "frozen".
>From the RTools download page this seems like it should work but I 'd
like to confirm.

Thanks in advance,

Brian

Hi John! 

Java was installed with Homebrew Cask as a user, if my memory doesn?t fail me. 

Thanks a lot for your help! Let?s see how the problem evolves.

Yeah, I don?t think we users can fix this issue. Let?s wait for a fix from rJava team.

Subject: [R] PCA with random effects
Message-ID: <45F935A8-1DE1-4BE5-96C0-BC43A896F009@ucalgary.ca>

I have the results of a rating study in which ~30 participants rated a subset
of 20 items on 25 different dimensions.

I would like to perform PCA on these ratings to reduce the 25 different
dimensions. However, instead of doing this on the mean ratings for each
item, I would like to perform the PCA at the level of individual ratings. I
am assuming that in order to do this I have to specify the fact that ratings
are nested within participants and within items (i.e., crossed random
effects for subjects and items). Is this possible?

This is a statistical question, which is typically off topic here.
This list is primarily concerned with R programming questions,
although the two areas sometimes do intersect. I suggest you post on a
statistical list such as stats.stackexchange.com instead, especially
if you do not get a useful reply here.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] New Package fansi: ANSI Control Sequence Aware String
 Functions
References: <570443092.435468.1522629550677.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <570443092.435468.1522629550677@mail.yahoo.com>

fansi provides counterparts to the base string manipulation functions substr, strwrap, strtrim, strsplit, and n(z)char that account for ANSI CSI SGR control sequences.? ANSI CSI SGR control sequences [1] can be used to format text in terminals that support them.

For example the control sequence "\033[31m" causes text that follows to render in red, and the control sequence "\033[0m" turns off formatting.? So with:

> substr_ctl("\033[31mABC\033[0m", 2, 2)
[1] "\033[31mB\033[0m"

we extract the second letter of the red formatted ABC while retaining the formatting.

fansi is written mostly in C, so its performance is comparable to the corresponding base functions.? There are versions of some of the functions with additional functionality.? For example, `substr2_ctl` supports character-width (as opposed to character-count) based substrings.

fansi is dependency-less.

Feedback is welcome either by e-mail or via github (<https://github.com/brodieG/fansi>).

Subject: [R] parfm unable to fit models when hazard rate is small
Message-ID: <1FBFD3C651590248A8EE6C86B93BE4173318DF26@MBXP01.ds.man.ac.uk>

Hello, I would like to use the parfm package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parfm/parfm.pdfhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parfm/parfm.pdf in my work. This package fits parametric frailty models to survival data. To ensure I was using it properly, I started by running some small simulations to generate some survival data (without any random effects), and analyse the data using the parfm package. I am using an exponential baseline hazard. When the baseline hazard rate drops to 0.001, I get the following error when trying to fit the model:

Error in optimHess(par = ESTIMATE, fn = Mloglikelihood, obs = obsdata,  :
  non-finite finite-difference value [1]
In addition: Warning message:
In log(pars) : NaNs produced

Has anybody else come across this issue, or could suggest why parfm struggles with low event rates? Or could someone please run my code to see if they get the same issue? Full reproducible code is presented below.

Many thanks for any help,
Alex

CODE:

### Create function to generate data
simulWeib <- function(N, lambda, rho, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4, rateC, sigma)
{
  # covariate --> N Bernoulli trials
  x1 <- sample(x=c(0, 1), size=N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5, 0.5))

  # Now create random effect stuff
  # Create one vector of length N, all drawn from same normal distribution
  rand.effect <- rnorm(N,0,sigma)

  # Weibull latent event times
  v <- runif(n=N)
  Tlat <- round((- log(v) / (lambda * exp(x1 * beta1 + rand.effect)))^(1 / rho))
  multiplier = exp(x1 * beta1 + rand.effect)
  haz=lambda * exp(x1 * beta1 + rand.effect)

  # censoring times
  #C <-rep(100000,N)
  C <- rexp(n=N, rate=rateC)

  # follow-up times and event indicators
  time <- pmin(Tlat, C)
  #status <- as.numeric(rep(1,N))
  status <- as.numeric(Tlat <= C)

  # data set
  data.frame(id=1:N,
             id10=ceiling(1:N/10),
             time=time,
             status=status,
             x1 = as.factor(x1),
             re=rand.effect,
             multiplier=multiplier,
             haz=haz)
}

### The reason it doesn't work is becayse the event rate gets so small!!
set.seed(101)

# Note that although data generated is for weibull, I set rho = 1 so it reduces to an exponential hazard, with rate = lambda
# Also note sigma = 0, so random effect is not present

## Create data and fit model, lambda = 0.1
data0<-simulWeib(10000,lambda=0.1,rho=1,rateC=0.0000000001, beta1=0.25,beta2=0,beta3=0,beta4=0, sigma = 0)
fit.cox0<-parfm(Surv(time,status) ~ x1, data=data0, dist="exponential")
fit.cox0

## Create data and fit model, lambda = 0.01
data0<-simulWeib(10000,lambda=0.01,rho=1,rateC=0.0000000001, beta1=0.25,beta2=0,beta3=0,beta4=0, sigma = 0)
fit.cox0<-parfm(Surv(time,status) ~ x1, data=data0, dist="exponential")
fit.cox0

## Create data and fit model, lambda = 0.001
data0<-simulWeib(10000,lambda=0.001,rho=1,rateC=0.0000000001, beta1=0.25,beta2=0,beta3=0,beta4=0, sigma = 0)
fit.cox0<-parfm(Surv(time,status) ~ x1, data=data0, dist="exponential")
fit.cox0

## Create data and fit model, lambda = 0.0001
data0<-simulWeib(10000,lambda=0.0001,rho=1,rateC=0.0000000001, beta1=0.25,beta2=0,beta3=0,beta4=0, sigma = 0)

Hi,

Thanks for the reproducible example.

Looking at
str(datn)
would give you a clue.
STATUS is a factor because it contains character values. Factor levels
by default are alphabetical with numbers first, but you can change
those.

> str(datn)
'data.frame': 36 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ LEVEL : Factor w/ 4 levels "DIPLOMA","MATRIC",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 ...
 $ STATUS: Factor w/ 9 levels "11121","11122",..: 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
 $ CGPA  : num  3.32 2.91 2.9 2.89 2.89 2.93 2.96 2.76 2.73 2.77 ...

> levels(datn$STATUS)
[1] "11121" "11122" "12131" "12132" "13141" "13142" "14151" "14152" "ENTRY"
> datn$STATUS <- factor(datn$STATUS, levels=c("ENTRY", "11121", "11122", "12131", "12132", "13141", "13142", "14151", "14152"))
> levels(datn$STATUS)
[1] "ENTRY" "11121" "11122" "12131" "12132" "13141" "13142" "14151" "14152"

Reorder the levels to your desired outcome, and then plot the data again.

This package fits parametric frailty models to survival data. To ensure I was using it properly, I started by running some small simulations to generate some survival data (without any random effects), and analyse the data using the parfm package. I am using an exponential baseline hazard. When the baseline hazard rate drops to 0.001, I get the following error when trying to fit the model:

Readers,

120,38
160,25
200,21

Please what is the function and syntax to obtain gradient values for the model curve at various requested values, e.g.:

when graphdata[,1] at values = 100, 250, 350 ?

This smells like homework, which the Posting Guide indicates is off topic.

I am not aware of "the function" that will solve this, but if you know what a gradient is analytically then you should be able to put together a solution very similar to the code you already have with the addition of using the coef function.

For the benefit of other novices, used the following command to read the documentation:

?coef

Then tried and obtained:

> cvalue100<-coef(graphmodelp~100)
> cvalue100
NULL

Then looked at the model values which of course correspond to original non-modelled values.

graphmodelp
        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8

        9        10        11 
10.287658  7.831233  5.961339

This prompted to think that interpolation is required, but the function 'approx' only seems to perform constant interpolation.

Is the correct thinking to find a function to perform interpolation, then find/write a function to differentiate the model at a specific value of x, to find gradient at that point?

Try

coef( graphmodeld )

And you don't need to approximate if you use the newdata argument to the predict function.

I think reading the "Introduction to R" that comes with R would help.

Should have been:

  coef(graphmodelp)

Read up on ?predict and what it delivers when only a model is offered as input.

Not correct. You already have `predict`. It is capale of using the `newdata` values to do interpolation with the values of the coefficients in the model. See: 

?predict

The original question asked for a derivative (i.e. a "gradient"), but so far it's not clear that you understand the mathematical definiton of that term. We also remain unclear whether this is homework.

A quick search engine query revealed primarily references to the dollar sign ($) operator which does not seem relevant to this question.

The motivation of this post was simple differentiation of a tangent point (dy/dx) manually, then wondering how to re-think in modern-day computing terms. Hence the original question about asking the appropriate functions/syntax to read further ("curiosity"), not the answer (indeed, "homework"). :)

Personal curiosity should be considered "homework".

You did not try my suggestion. You tried David's, which has a leftover mistake from your guesses about what the argument to coef should be.

Yes, sorry for the mistake.

coef(graphmodeld)
   (Intercept) graphdata[, 1] 
   4.513544204   -0.006820623

This corresponds to the linear model but it is still not understood how this helps to determine gradients at specific points for the exponential model.

You have fitted log(y) against x. Your fitted linear model is therefore 
log(y) = 4.5135 - 0.00682x

From there:
- do the basic algebra to get y in terms of x
- differentiate analytically to get dy/dx as a function of x.
- write that calculation in R to get your gradients at any value of x.

Or you could get R to give you the differential function from your function for y; see ?D

Besides symbolic differentiation, there is also the option of numeric differentiation. Here's an amateurish attempt:

myNumDeriv <- function(x){ (exp( predict (graphmodeld, newdata=data.frame(t=x+.0001))) - 
                                            exp( predict (graphmodeld, newdata=data.frame(t=x) )))/
                                          .0001 }
myNumDeriv(c(100, 250, 350))

I realized that this would not work in the context of your construction. I had earlier made a more symbolic version using R formulae:

 graphdata<-read.csv(text='t,c
 0,100
 40,78
 80,59
 120,38
 160,25
 200,21
 240,16
 280,12
 320,10
 360,9
 400,7')
 graphmodeld<-lm(log(c)~t, graphdata)
 graphmodelp<-exp(predict(graphmodeld))
 plot(c~t, graphdata)
 lines(graphdata[,1],graphmodelp)
 myNumDeriv(c(100, 250, 350), graphmodeld )

Again I attempt to correct my incomplete code with this definition that had be modified to take a model object as its second argument:

myNumDeriv <- function(x, mod) (exp( predict (mod, newdata=data.frame(t=x+.0001))) - exp( predict (mod, newdata=data.frame(t=x) )))/.0001

R-experts,

I have fitted many different lines. The fast-tau estimator (yellow line) seems strange to me?because this yellow line is not at all in agreement with the other lines (reverse slope, I mean the yellow line has a positive slope and the other ones have negative slope). 
Is there something wrong in my R code ? Is it because the Y variable is 1 vector and should be a matrix ?

Here is the reproducible code

###############
X=c(5,3,2,4,7,6,9,3,7,11,1,6,4,5,6,9,4,5,34,2,1,3,12,8,9,7,4,12,19,21)

{reg1<-lm(Y ~ X)
plot(X,Y)
abline(reg1, col="black")

install.packages("robustbase") 
library?(robustbase)
reg=lmrob(Y ~ X)
abline(reg, col="green")

abline(L1,col="blue")

install.packages("RobPer")
library(RobPer)
FastTau(Y,X)
fast=FastTau(Y,X)
abline(unlist(fast), col="yellow")

It's not quite reproducible:? you forgot the line to create Dataset. 
It's probably something like

Dataset <- data.frame(Y, Z)

abline() doesn't know what to do with the "fast" object.? It isn't a 
vector containing intercept and slope, it's a list containing them.? So 
you'll need something like

abline(unlist(fast), col="yellow")

You need to pay attention to the documentation more closely. If you don't 
know what something means, that is usually a signal that you need to study 
more... in this case about the difference between an input variable and a 
design (model) matrix. This is a concept from the standard linear algebra 
formulation for regression equations. (Note that I have never used RobPer, 
nor do I regularly mess with model matrices, but I do recognize the term 
"design matrix" and used help.search("design matrix") to track this down.)

Thanks for the reprex, though it is highly irregular to intersperse 
install.packages in code that may be run more than once.

I have never found the R symbolic differentiation helpful because my

graphmodeld <- lm( log(c) ~ t, data = graphdta )

R users may want to note that there are some extensions in packages for symbolic derivatives.

In particular, Duncan Murdoch added some "all in R" tools in the package nlsr that I maintain. This
is a substitute for the nls() function that uses a fairly unsatisfactory forward difference derivative
approximation. Moreover, the solver in nlsr is a variant of the Marquardt stabilized Gauss-Newton
approach, rather than the straight Gauss-Newton that often gives a "singular gradient" error. Nothing
is free, of course, and the Marquardt approach often uses more iterations when the problem is
uncomplicated. On the other hand, it is rather like a pit bull in trying to find a solution.

There is also the Deriv package, also "all in R". Both it and nlsr allow extensions to the derivatives
table, though I think most users will need to do some homework to become comfortable with doing
that.

There is also a Google Summer of Code proposal this year to wrap the Julia Automatic Differentiation
tools to R. This would allow derivatives of coded functions to be computed avoiding approximations.
I believe it will be at least partly successful in achieving its goals.

Unfortunately (and I would rather hope that someone can say eventually that I am wrong), I believe
no tool is universally applicable.

1. *If* this is homework, we do not do homework here.

2. Please read and follow the posting guide linked below to get a
useful answer. In general, we expect posters to provide code showing
their attempt to solve the problem, rather than expecting to be
provided complete solutions. See also instructions for providing a
small reproducible example.

3. Search! e.g. on the rseek.org site, inputting "AUC" gave this, among others:
https://www.r-bloggers.com/calculating-auc-the-area-under-a-roc-curve/

Cheers,

Subject: [R] Syntax roccomp-using R
Message-ID: <CAJhjxo3PXhmNL=toEX8jGypWNpdRjGW7PU8QXfLzM9sFEYTFUQ@mail.gmail.com>

*Dear Bert, *

Thank you very much for your feedback and the useful link https://rseek.org/
and https://www.r-bloggers.com/calculating-auc-the-area-under-a-roc-curve/.
Actually, I want to know different performance between Stata and R, in
multilevel logistic regression. For this purposes, I replicate ".do" file
use Stata in
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153778. The
nice journal not only gives ".do" file but also ".dta" file for Stata
user. Fyi,
I succeed running my dataset accordingly approach that use in the nice
article.

In Model ii, by adding the random effects of the clusters (neighbourhoods)
only, I perform a multilevel logistic regression. Adding the neighbourhoods
a random effect considerably increase the DA of the model. If the AU-ROC
increases. This means the neighbourhoods have a relevant (observational)
General Contextual Effect on the individual outcome. That is, knowledge on
the clusters where the individuals reside is relevant for classifying
individuals. That is, for distinguishing those with from those without the
outcome. In Model iii, as expected, the AU-ROC remains similar to Model ii
after including a neighbourhoods level variable as a fixed effect. Model ii
represents the ?ceiling? of the explanatory power of the clusters. However,
particularly both syntax in the steps below, the process taking time very
long, particularly for a data set with the 130,585 observation that I have.

I trust can be replicate the syntax Stata below into the script language of
R under your advice. I want to to know the performance of R to analyse in
the syntax " roccomp".  Unfortunately, the process still not finished in
this step yet at the moment.

. * FIGURE 3 - AU-ROC

********************************************************************************
. roccomp Y  r2m1p r2m2p, graph summary


Abbreviations
Y      = The dependent (or responding) variable
AUC    = Area Under the Curve.
AUROC  = Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
ROC    = Receiver operating characteristic
r1m1p  =  Pr(malaria)
r1m2p  = Predicted mean
r1m3p  = Predicted mean


In addition, I saw in
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auRoc/index.html, and in
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/limma/versions/3.28.14/topics/auROC
,  there is an issue regarding auROC.

Hopefully with install "CRAN - Package auRoc", I can be running the
"roccomp" used the plug-in. In addition, I can compute areas under ROC
curves using the R Commander. However, the R Commander doesn't include ROC
curves, but a Google search suggests that the RcmdrPlugin.EZR, a plug-in
package for the R Commander, includes ROC curves and may do what I want.
Isn't it?


Again thank you very much, I appreciate it.


Best wishes


Hamzah

You need to pay attention to the documentation more closely. If you don't 
know what something means, that is usually a signal that you need to study 
more... in this case about the difference between an input variable and a 
design (model) matrix. This is a concept from the standard linear algebra 
formulation for regression equations. (Note that I have never used RobPer, 
nor do I regularly mess with model matrices, but I do recognize the term 
"design matrix" and used help.search("design matrix") to track this down.)

Thanks for the reprex, though it is highly irregular to intersperse 
install.packages in code that may be run more than once.

I do not provide consulting services, so you're on your own. As I said
earlier, you need to follow the posting guide and show us what efforts
you have made.
"None" will probably not succeed in getting anyone to help. Nor should
you expect anyone on this list to be familiar with Stata and/or to do
your "translation" work for you.

rbind, merge?

total_pb<-   ??

sdmdata_SM <- data.frame(cbind(pb_SM, rbind(presvals_SM, absvals_SM))

I don't see how anyone can help you if you don't provide the input data (or a fake version of the data) you are using.

Subject: [R] Question about subset
Message-ID: <594082573.429069.1523246796179.JavaMail.zimbra@cognigencorp.com>

Hi,

The help page for subset states "subset: logical expression indicating elements or rows to keep: missing values are taken as false."

Before I try to re-invent the wheel, I would like to know if one of the base or recommended packages would contain a variant of the subset function that would consider missing values as true.

Thanks

Please read the "Details" section of the help file -- it essentially
tells you what to do by directly using indexing; e.g. for a vector,
index by:
[is.na(subset) | subset]  .

Adjust as necessary for your data structure.Or look at the code of,
e.g. subset.data.frame and create your own subset version/method by
making the trivial modification to that code.

R is open source. Sometimes it's worthwhile to take advantage of this
by making a simple modification to its code on your own before hunting
for packages.

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] linear regression with repeated measures
Message-ID: <CALDESV8PnY1MJQ7w0aV7YrBB8R9KFhM3A3AE_uHty2Xo3Bxw+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

this seemed to me like a very trivial question, but finally I haven't found
any similar postings with suitable solutions on the net ...
Basically, instead of regressing two simple series of measures 'a' and 'b'
(like b ~ a), I would like to use independent replicate measurements for
each variable at each level (ie, instead of having just one 'a' and one 'b'
I have independent replicates for all measures of 'a' and 'b', 'a1' could
be as well compared to 'b1' as to 'b2' etc.)
In analogy one could think of a procedure claiming to act and increase a
given output value by eg 30% (compared to not emplying this procedure).
Now I have indepedent repeated measures (since the measures themselves are
considered not very precise) for a (large) number of individuals with and
without the treatment.
Basically, I want to test the hypthesis that applying the procedure
increases values in a linear way by a given factor, thus test the
parameters of a linear regression (eg slope=1.3, offset may be different to
0). In extension to this, how could I make a confidence-interval for the
estimated slop (due to the treatment) to check if the claimed value is
indeed inside ?

# Here some toy data, my real data are much larger and might ressemble
somehow to this.
# Lines are for subjects and columns for 2 groups and repeat-measurements.
# in this case I introduce a toy-factor of 1.3 to the 2nd part of my data
(in the real data such a factor is just a hypothesis), which I would like
to investigate/confirm
dat <- matrix(rep(1:12,7)+rnorm(84),nc=7)
dat[,4:7] <- 1.3*dat[,4:7]+runif(48)
# some individual measures may be missing :
dat[2:3,4] <- NA
colnames(dat) <- paste(rep(c("a","b"),3:4),c(1:3,1:4),sep="")

# In analogy to the ample documentation of lm() :
datMean <- cbind(aM=rowMeans(dat[,1:3]),bM=rowMeans(dat[,4:7]))
(lmMean <- lm(bM ~ aM,data=as.data.frame(datMean)))
# I suppose the estimated parameters (intercet & slope) may be correct but
sice the degrees of freedom are not made of means I am convinced they are
incorrect and thus any statistics using them will be so, too ...
df.residual(lmMean)
summary(lmMean)

# I also thought about a workaround reorganizing the data into a 'simple'
two-column setup using somthing like stack() and allowing b ~ a, but again,
I suppose the degrees of freedom won't be correct neither.

# 1) should I simply correct the degrees of freedom in my lm-object, would
this be the correct number of degrees of freedom
lmMean$df.residual <- nrow(dat)*5-2
# then I suppose I would need to change the standard errors, I'm shur what
is the best way to do so

# or 2) is there a package allowing to do these steps, thus returning
correct DF, Std Err and Pr(>|t) ?

Thanks in advance,

Generally, statistics questions are off topic here, although they do
sometimes intersect R programming issues, as perhaps here.
Nevertheless, I believe your post would fit better on the
r-sig-mixed-models list, where repeated measures and other mixed
effects (/variance components) models are discussed. It sounds like
you may also want to do some reading about mixed effects models to
understand the issues involved, but as I found your post confusing,
maybe I'm wrong about that.

stats.stackexchange.com is another online venue for mostly statistics
discussions.

Cheers,
Bert

Your email is hard to read because you sent html email. Please send plain text.

You will need to say what you mean by "join". It's not a standard term with a universally agreed upon meaning within R.

If you have 5 data frames, each with 5 rows, and it makes sense that after joining you should have one data frame with 25 rows and the same number of columns, then rbind() is probably what you want.

If you have 5 data frames, each with 5 rows, and it makes sense that after joining you should have one data frame with 5 rows, and more columns, then merge() is probably what you want.

But some of your code suggests you have a somewhat complex data structure, so it's hard to say.

extract() is not a base R function; when asking for help one should indicate where non-base functions come from.

Subject: [R] Specifying forbidden configurations in Morris One at a Time
 (OAT) sensitivity analysis
Message-ID: <CADwXhHLsJu7EgJr3PTtwN7WvrVQQBZ8FQ_FLfA5H7i5LH_vQqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I am trying to implement the Morris One at a Time (OAT) sensitivity
analysis technique in R using the package 'sensitivity'.  The OAT and
similar other techniques in the package requires data frame X (which stores
the design or parameter combinations) to be populated by some function in
the package such as fast99 or morris. These functions take only the range
and step size of the parameters as arguments. However, in my experiment
there are few forbidden configurations. Is there a way to specify this in
the analysis set up? To be specific, is there a way to tell the model that
certain combinations are forbidden such as feeding forbidden configurations
via a text file or specifying a conditional expression which will exclude
the forbidden configurations (eg: parameter 1 < parameter 2) ?

Thanks and regards,
Reshma CC

Hello,

Though Bert's and David's answers are what you should do, note that some 
R functions that need factors will coerce their input variables when 
necessary.
Have you tried to run the code you haven't posted without coercing to 
factor? It might run...

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Fail to save an object using name as string
Message-ID: <2ad46db8-bbdf-4527-ccb9-5bd68b39fc74@yahoo.fr>

Dear list member,

I think that I have detected a strange behavior of the save() command:

 > year <- "2000"
 > assign(paste0("Var_", year), list(A=10, B=20))
 > get(paste0("Var_", year))
$A
[1] 10

$B
[1] 20

# At this point all is ok, I have created a list of name Var_2000

 > save(paste0("Var_", year), file=paste0("Var_", year, ".Rdata"))
Error in save(paste0("Var_", year), file = paste0("Var_", year, 
".Rdata")) :
 ? objet ?paste0("Var_", year)? introuvable

(introuvable=cannot be found)

but

 > save("Var_2000", file=paste0("Var_", year, ".Rdata"))

When I read the help for save: ?save

...??? the names of the objects to be saved (as symbols or character 
strings).

I checked if paste0("Var_", year) produced a character string:

 > str("Var_2000")
 ?chr "Var_2000"
 > str(paste0("Var_", year))
 ?chr "Var_2000"

The solution was to include the name in the list argument:

 > save(list=paste0("Var_", year), file=paste0("Var_", year, ".Rdata"))

But I don't understand what is the difference between "Var_2000" and 
paste0("Var_", year) as both produced the same output.

Thanks for your help,

Marc

Have you ever noticed that when you run

x <- 1:5
y <- 2:6
plot( x, y+1 )

you get the expressions you used in your call to plot on the axis labels? `x` is an expression consisting of a single symbol and y+1 is an expression consisting of the addition operator and two arguments: the symbol x and the constant 1. Plot uses these expressions in two ways: one to get numbers to plot, but also converts the expressions into strings that can be printed on the axes.

The save function has an `...` argument that it expects to find symbol names in,  and when you pass an expression as an unnamed argument instead and it then tries to convert the expression to a string and use that as a name for a variable, you get problems.... so don't do that. 

The save function also has the named argument `list` that does not have that symbol-name-extracting behaviour. By explicitly passing a vector of character strings (of length one in your case) in the named `list` argument you avoid that special handling applied by the save function to the `...` argument.

It does seem strange at first, but it goes along with some rather convenient features of the R statistical environment like formulas and intuitive plot labeling, and the ability to use

save( Var_2000, file = paste0( "Var_", year, ".Rdata" ) )

with no quotes.

After that I have the following error:

Have you called ?sort? on a list?

The subset argument to subset is something that evaluates to logical - a vector of True or False. 
If you wanted to treat missing values _in that_ as TRUE, wrap it in an ifelse:

ifelse(is.na(condition), TRUE, condition)

where condition can be a logical or an expression evaluating to logical.

Just use a Boolean expression 

is.na(col)|(col==0)

Not sure whether this is the problem but calling your data frame 
data.frame is not a good idea.

First, please post reproducible examples; your code will not run in anyone else's session (for example you have not shown where the data frame comes from), and if the code does not generate the error message reproducibly, noone can tell you exactly why it happens

Second, please _follow_ the posting guide and work through the suggested steps before posting a question to this list. An internet search for this error would have told you what causes it.

Finally: 
- Your loop will not work because your loop variable is I and the index is i; they are different in R. You'll just update the same column (i) lots of times, assuming i is defined.

- The error message arises from a call to factor() in as.factor(). It tells you that the column being converted is not a simple vector. That in turn tells me that you have not constructed your data frame correctly. I can't tell you what you did wrong there. 

- As another poster has said, data.frame is the name of a function - one that construicts a data frame. R can often tell which you want, but it is never safe to use the name of a function as the name of a data object. Use a different name for your data frame.

S Ellison

Hi
You could instead of selecting columns by name select them by number

Something like
your.data[,2:3] <- do.call(data.frame, lapply(your.data[,2:3], factor))

or you could construct a vector of column numbers

x <- c(2,3)

Cheers
Petr

Error in sort.list(y) : 'x' must be atomic for 'sort.list'
Have you called ?sort? on a list?

Message-ID: <A59963DF2FC12B49AB50D3ED683AB7BA92E67B@NT-EX01.dnsbego.de>

Dear Mr. Savicky,

I am currently working on a project where I want to test a random number generator, which is supposed to create 10.000 continuously uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1. I am now wondering if I can use the Chi-Squared-Test to solve this problem or if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test would be a better fit.

I came across one of your threads on the internet where you answer a similar question and thought I'd reach out to you.


Thanks in advance
Florian Huber

Hi everyone.

I need an information about compatibility of R and Suse Linux. I have installed R 3.2.1 in Suse Linux 11 SP4 and I would like know if it?s compatible the upgrade for the new version 3.4.4 in my Suse release? This information?s about version R and linux version have in site or other place?

Dear Marcos,

The current Version of opensuse Linux is Leap 42.3 (when I'm still right). Probably you should upgrade your Linux system before installing one of the most recent versions of R.

Hi,

your question is nearly impossible to answer without actual testing of
your existing pipelines.  But from my soon 20-year usage of R, it's
clear to me that the R Core Team strives to keep things backward
compatible as far as they can.  The NEWS file:

  https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html

contains useful information on what's been updated in each release -
you can inspect that one from your own perspective.  There are also
12,000 packages on CRAN that are tested on old-release, current
release, and developers version of R.  Many of these packages rarely
gets updated, which indicates that these package work across a large
number of R versions (and platforms).

FYI, R 3.5.0 is being released on April 23, 2018.  You should aim to
install that version.   Also, on Linux it's not too hard to install
multiple R versions in parallel when you install from source.  Then
you can go back and forth between version whenever you'd like.

/Henrik

Hi Albrecht, thanks for your return.

I'm  using the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64) PATCHLEVEL = 4 and not the openSUSE. Do you know if exist a compatibility list of R and Linux version? In the site
https://cran.r-project.org is informed only about the R version 3.4.4 for SLE12 but not about the previous versions. I can't upgrade for SLE12 and I would like know what is the last version that I can use of R in my SUSE version.

Best regards.

The reason people like to pay companies for their commercial or "enterprise" operating system distributions is because the someone you pay can do all the legwork to confirm compatibility. You should be asking your commercial distro provider to render this service. If they deem it too far below their radar to help you with then you need to identify which open distro is similar enough to your commercial environment to piggyback OS packages from, or go to the source and start compiling and installing required supporting software, which may extend to installing the necessary compiler to build R. The version of Linux itself is unlikely to prevent this last option from working.

R-Help

I am attempting to create a series of bivariate normal distributions.  So using the mvtnorm library I have created the following code ...

# Standard deviations and correlation
sig_x <- 1
sig_y <- 1
rho_xy <- 0.0

# Covariance between X and Y
sig_xy <- rho_xy * sig_x *sig_y

# Covariance matrix
Sigma_xy <- matrix(c(sig_x ^ 2, sig_xy, sig_xy, sig_y ^ 2), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

# Load the mvtnorm package
library("mvtnorm")

# Means
mu_x <- 0
mu_y <- 0

# Simulate 1000 observations
set.seed(12345)  # for reproducibility
xy_vals <- rmvnorm(1000, mean = c(mu_x, mu_y), sigma = Sigma_xy) 

# Have a look at the first observations
head(xy_vals)

# Create scatterplot
plot(xy_vals[, 1], xy_vals[, 2], pch = 16, cex = 2, col = "blue", 
     main = "Bivariate normal: rho = 0.0", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")

# Add lines
abline(h = mu_y, v = mu_x)

Problem is this results in sigma(x) = sigma(y), rho=0 and I need or what 2sigma(x)=sigma(y), rho=0 or 2sigma(y)=sigma(x), rho=0 to elongate the distribution.  What I have created creates a circle.  Can I do that within the mvtnorm package?

Er, yes ... that is what you asked for.

Have you tried rho_xy=0.7 or similar in the code above?

Subject: [R] WGCNA package installation segmentation fault
Message-ID: <CA+hbrhVg+dZ6SAHBUhjw3x6hPZzt9pxdTuiPpXQ5-yMx-nM8Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

a user contacted me about a segfault when installing WGCNA package
dowloaded from CRAN. I also see a segfault like that on certain
installs of R.

The package passes all CRAN checks, so presumably this has something
to do with the R installation or environment. The R versions here are
not the newest but I would guess that this is not an R version issue.

I'm attaching two sessionInfo() outputs on systems where the
installation throws a segfault.

Any pointers/ideas as to what could be going wrong?

Thanks,

Peter

Hello All,


I'm struggling to solve this ODE using R,


vdpol <- function (h, v, t) (
          list(c (
            -0.1*v/(pi*(2*10*h-h^2)),
              (v = (-0.1*v/(pi*(2*10*h-h^2))^2) + 2*9.81*h))

                  ))
          library(deSolve)
          yini <- (c(h = 20, v=0))
          nonstiff <- ode(y = yini, func = vdpol,
                          times= seq(0, 30, by = 0.01),
                                     parms = 1)

It says that


 The number of derivatives returned by func() (4) must equal the length of the initial conditions vector (2)


I'm not sure how when i only have two derivates in the equation. I have little to no knowledge of R and I'm following guidance of the internet so any help is appreciated.


Kind Regards,


H

Subject: [R] R Timeseries tsoutliers:tso
Message-ID: <CALSQRkQn6x2DeZJ-otciNXiUCYYJBvHuXj5R+0Tw3SDXG424XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Writing to seek help in regard to some unexpected performance anomaly i am
observing in using tsoutlers:tso on the mac vs on an AWS cloud server..


I am running the following code with very small dataset of about 208
records.

d.dir <- '/Users/darshanpandya/xxxxxx'
FNAME <- 'my_data.csv'

d.input <- fread(file.path(paste0(d.dir,"/zzz/"),FNAME,fsep =
.Platform$file.sep), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, showProgress
= TRUE) %>% as.data.frame
d.input$dummy_date <- as.Date(d.input$dummy_date, "%Y-%m-%d")

selectedCols <- c("observation","dummy_date")
inputData <- d.input[,selectedCols]
outlier.types <- list("Additive Outliers","Levels Shifts","Seasonal Level
Shifts","Innovation Outlier","Temporary Change")
tsFrequency <- 52
params <- list("outlier.types" = outlier.types,"tsFrequency" = tsFrequency)

tsFrequency = params$tsFrequency
outTypes <- unlist(params$outlier.types)
ts.var <- ts(inputData[,1], frequency = tsFrequency)
ts_outlier <- tso(ts.var, types =
?outlier.types ?
, maxit = 1)

?

This piece of code runs in about 60 seconds on my laptop but take about
upward of 13 mins on a decent AWS node with nothing else running on it.

Any hints as to why this is happening is greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your help.
?

Sincerely,
Darshan

Subject: [R] repeating functions for different folders?
Message-ID: <CAMwU6B0B+526n2Fy7mDVtAcxUp-vxtnbYvG7seor7ZsZ6NDu8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R users,
I need to run a analysis using a data for each folder. I do have several
folders. Each folder contains several files but these files name are
similar to the files that is saved into  another folders.  I need to repeat
the analysis for every folder and would like to save the output in that
particular folder.  After completing the analysis in one folder, I want to
move another folder. Basically I was doing manually (repeating the analysis
each and every folder manually). Is there any way to make a loop so that I
can run the analysis for different folders? Is there any example code?

Thanks for your help.
MW

Hi Marna,
Assuming that you are descending into different subdirectories from
the same directory:

directories<-c("dir1","dir2","dir3")
for(directory in directories) {
 setwd(directory)
 # do whatever you want to do
 # then return to the directory above
 setwd("..")
}

This will allow you to start and finish in the same directory.

Jim

Maybe this assumption is not needed.
Since setwd returns the current directory, it is safer to assign that 
value to a variable and in the end use it reset the original state.

Using your code,

directories<-c("dir1","dir2","dir3")
for(directory in directories) {
    old_dir <- setwd(directory)
    # do whatever you want to do
    # then return to the original directory
    setwd(old_dir)
}


Hope this helps,

Hello,

Writing to seek help in regard to some unexpected performance anomaly i am
observing in using tsoutlers:tso on the mac vs on an AWS cloud server..


I am running the following code with very small dataset of about 208
records.

d.dir <- '/Users/darshanpandya/xxxxxx'
FNAME <- 'my_data.csv'

d.input <- fread(file.path(paste0(d.dir,"/zzz/"),FNAME,fsep =
.Platform$file.sep), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, showProgress
= TRUE) %>% as.data.frame
d.input$dummy_date <- as.Date(d.input$dummy_date, "%Y-%m-%d")

selectedCols <- c("observation","dummy_date")
inputData <- d.input[,selectedCols]
outlier.types <- list("Additive Outliers","Levels Shifts","Seasonal Level
Shifts","Innovation Outlier","Temporary Change")
tsFrequency <- 52
params <- list("outlier.types" = outlier.types,"tsFrequency" = tsFrequency)

tsFrequency = params$tsFrequency
outTypes <- unlist(params$outlier.types)
ts.var <- ts(inputData[,1], frequency = tsFrequency)
ts_outlier <- tso(ts.var, types =
?outlier.types ?
, maxit = 1)

?

This piece of code runs in about 60 seconds on my laptop but take about
upward of 13 mins on a decent AWS node with nothing else running on it.

Any hints as to why this is happening is greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your help.

You can record the time to evaluate each line by wrapping each line in a
call to system.time().  E.g.,

expressions <- quote({
    # paste your commands here, or put them into a file and use exprs <-
parse("thatFile")
    d.dir <- '/Users/darshanpandya/xxxxxx'
FNAME <- 'my_data.csv'

d.input <- fread(file.path(paste0(d.dir,"/zzz/"),FNAME,fsep =
.Platform$file.sep), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, showProgress
= TRUE) %>% as.data.frame
  # ... the rest of your lines
})
expressions <- as.list(expressions)[-1]

timedExpressions <- lapply(expressions,
function(expr)bquote(system.time(.(expr))))

source(exprs=timedExpressions, echo=TRUE)

See which line (or lines) show big time differences on the two platforms.

Subject: [R] Reading xpt files into R
Message-ID: <1907640263.304232.1523638916808@mail2.virginmedia.com>

Hello R folk

I have an xpt file which I have been trying to open into R in R studio

On the net I found guidance which says that I need packages Hmisc and SASxport which I have successfully loaded.

I had also found some code which says that this would allow me to read the xpt file into R:

library(SASxport)
data(Alfalfa)
lookup.xport("test.xpt")
Alfalfa<-read.xport("test.xpt")

I have set the directory correctly as far as I am aware, but when I tried to run this code I got the following error messages:

> lookup.xport("test.xpt")
Error in lookup.xport.inner(file) : file not in SAS transfer format
> Alfalfa<-read.xport("test.xpt")
Error in read.xport("test.xpt") : 
The specified file does not start with a SAS xport file header!

I neither know what the file being not in SAS transfer format means, nor what not starting with an SAS xport file header means either...
If anyone can explain how I can read this xpt file into R I'd be v grateful

Thanks Nick Wray

R-Help

 

I'm working in my first large database (53,098,492,383 records).  When I
select the db via something like

 

Library(SparkR)

mydata <- sql("SELECT * FROM <table name>")

 

is "mydata" a SparkDataFrame,  and do I work with SparkDataFrames like I
would regular df (per say); because I can't image I would ever create a 53
billion record df.  I'm starting to acquaint myself with e SparkR package,
but I get confuse because it appears df and SparkDtaFrame are use
interchangeable. Or maybe not.

 

Looking for a good intro to SparkDataFrame.

The "export" or "transfer format from SA is supposed to make reading data less difficult and standardized. This is what a header from the version used by the NHANES releases (that's all one line):

HEADER RECORD*******LIBRARY HEADER RECORD!!!!!!!000000000000000000000000000000  SAS     SAS     SASLIB  9.2     XP_PRO

You can look at the file with a text editor.

There is a read.xport function in the foreign package and I think most people would have chosen that one as a first attemp. It's part of the standard R distribution. It refers you to https://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts140.pdf for details on the format.

Dear R-experts,

I am trying to do cross-validation for different models using the cvTools package.

I can't get the CV for the "FastTau" and "hbrfit". I guess I have to write my own functions at least for hbrfit. What is going wrong with FastTau ?

Here below the reproducible example. It is a simple toy example (not my real dataset) with many warnings, what is important to me are the errors.

Message-ID: <bacf5203-e07c-7944-9935-5e5c18b9fa06@auckland.ac.nz>


Suppose that (e.g.) xyplot() returns an object "xxx" with (say) 3 pages.
I would like to extract/plot (print) just one of these pages, e.g.
page 2.

Here's a toy example:

x   <- rep(seq(0,1,length=11),12)
set.seed(42)
y   <- rnorm(3*44)
a   <- rep(letters[1:12],each=11)
dta <- data.frame(x=x,y=y,a=a)
xxx <- xyplot(y~x|a,data=dta,layout=c(2,2))

I would to extract from xxx and print page 2 (the page corresponding to
levels e, f, g and h).

Is there any (simple) way that I can do this?

I've mucked around with update.trellis() and [.trellis, but I cannot 
make head nor tail of the documentation.  The [.trellis method seems to 
work in some situations, but not in others, and since I cannot 
understand what it actually does, I cannot figure out why.

E.g. in my toy example "xxx[5:8]" seems to give me what I want, but in 
the context of my real application a similar construction does not work.

Thanks for any insight.

cheers,

I have a data.table with dimensions 100 by 10^7.

When I do

    trainIndex <-

        df$status,
        p = .9,

    outerTest  <- df[-trainIndex]

Subsetting the rows of df takes over 20 minutes.

What is the best way to efficiently subset this?

Thanks!

You have 10^7 columns? That process is bound to be slow.

Oh, there are ways, but the constraining issue here is moving data (memory bandwidth), and data table is probably already the fastest mechanism for doing that. If you have a computer with four or more real cores you can try setting up a subset of the columns in each task and cbind the results afterward, but it will be hard to accomplish without making extra copies of the data. You are already probably already using virtual memory which is saved to and from hard disk storage as needed. 

Working in Spark with a distributed file system like Hadoop might solve some of these problems... but I haven't done real work with such tools.

That's what he tried, but the bottom line is that just because something is called foo.xpt there is no guarantee that it actually is a SAS XPORT file. Firefox plugins use the same extension but it could really be anything - naming conventions are just that: conventions.

So dig deeper and find out what the file really is (or was supposed to be).

Well yesterday I'd downloaded the "foreign" package and tried to open the xpt file using that:

library(foreign)
read.xport("test.xpt")

I got the following error and warning messages:

> read.xport("test.xpt")
Error in read.xport("test.xpt") : 
The specified file does not start with a SAS xport file header!
In addition: Warning message:
In readBin(file, what = character(0), n = 1, size = nchar(xport.file.header,  :
null terminator not found: breaking string at 10000 bytes

I can open the xpt using wordpad and there is a header but it seems to be just text.  I really don't know what constitutes an "
SAS xport file header"

Does read.xport read both version 5 and version 8 xpt files?  This link to
the Library of Congress can get you started on how to interpret the
header.  (It states that Version 8 was introduced in 2012 but was not in
wide use as of early 2017.)

I'm not sure why Peter deleted my copy of a sample of a SAS xport header that I took from an NHANES data distribution. He seemed to think I was confused about the function you had been using. The reason I mentioned that `read.xport` was from the 'foreign' package is that one generally loads that package to make the function available, while it appears you were using a different package, SASxport, and I didn't know whether that package had a function which had the same name as the one from pkg-foreign, and if it did whether it might depend on the read.xport function in foreign. You should not need to download the 'foreign' package, since it ships with every distribution of R. These are the arguments accepted by that function:

SASxport::read.xport
function (file, force.integer = TRUE, formats = NULL, name.chars = NULL, 
    names.tolower = FALSE, keep = NULL, drop = NULL, as.is = 0.95, 
    verbose = FALSE, as.list = FALSE, include.formats = FALSE) 


 When I look at the SASxport::read.xport function code, it is in fact, _not_ the same function. But it does have the R statement about what it thinks qualifies as a SAS xprot file:

xport.file.header <- "HEADER RECORD*******LIBRARY HEADER RECORD!!!!!!!000000000000000000000000000000  "

It checks to see whether the file starts with that string.

This is what appeared in my first message:

So the header is text, but it is text with a particular structure. If your file doesn't have that structure, then it's not a SAS xport file. The .xpt extension is also used for Mozilla Firefox plugins.

Actually not, Peter. Wray was using a function of the same name, but not from pkg-foreign. Perhaps he was following the tutorial at:

Peter and I agree agree on that advice.

Version 8 SAS xport files have the header
  HEADER RECORD*******LIBV8 HEADER RECORD!!!!!!!000000000000000000000
000000000
It is easy to check for that in your text editor or in R.

Subject: [R] about family=binomial in glm funtion
Message-ID: <CAN_1JwS5_AnEUuPFd05RJtwAwfiBs_S4SLNYsf0O7koENKQtag@mail.gmail.com>

Hei,
  I just wonder the use of family=binomial in glm function.
  As I learned from book (e.g. Andy Field) that logistic regression (binary
logit) can use glm funtion with family = binomial. Here the y is a factor
variable (e.g. value = 1 or 2).

 But I have also seen i many other cases, same function glm with
family=binomial, but y is a variable with several column , like y=
cbind(y1, y2), and here y1  and y2 are the success number, failure number
respectively.


What is the difference between these cases ? For my opinion the first one
is a logit model, and second one is a binomial probability model , right?

Many thanks.

What I'd suggest is that you read the documentation.  In this case ?glm 
doesn't give the answer, but it links to ?family, which does.

Subject: [R] RQDA/RGtk2 Installation Problem
Message-ID: <CAGJtK3QD6xrkxbjcxKKWO5CcMSUVgNSYdMPjOx359mcRm_htzw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have been having a problem installing RQDA on my Mac (OS 10.13.2). I
followed the installation process on the RQDA page (
http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/), but I keep getting an error message
saying that I am missing pkg-config and GTK. I reinstalled XQuartz and GTK+
2.24.17 multiple times (and reinstalled R version 3.4.4), but kept
receiving the same error message. I also tried to install RGtk2 from
MacPort, but got the same error messages. I am posting the log below, in
hope it will help someone to see the problem/solution.

In my Googling for solution, I saw some other people posting the same
problem, but have not seen a solution. I'd appreciate if anyone could help
me to fix this. I really would love to be able to use RQDA!

Thanks in advance for your help.

Ryoko

That may have messed things up if it modified your PATH environment settings. You should notice that the instructions on the http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/ page are to install the GTK+ binary from http://r.research.att.com/

So you are on a Mac. There's a special mailing list for us. Have you installed Xcode and the CLT?

You will need to read and foolw the advice at the top of the following page:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Have you searched StackOverflow? I found teh following answer there. (I think it's a bit incomplete since you should have the system variables set according to the Tools page, so I editted that answer.) But this looked like a starting point ... after setting environment variables and getting the Fortran compileras per above

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19645590/running-rattle-on-mac-os-x-10-9-mavericks/19719518#19719518

Do not reply to this mailing list (or to just me); rather send it to the R-SIG-Mac mailing list (after subscribing and reading the Posting Guide which it appears you have not done.)

 *Dear Bert, *

Thank you very much for your feedback and the useful link https://rseek.org/
and https://www.r-bloggers.com/calculating-auc-the-area-under-a-roc-curve/.
Actually, I want to know different performance between Stata and R, in
multilevel logistic regression. For this purposes, I replicate ".do" file
use Stata in
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153778. The
nice journal not only gives ".do" file but also ".dta" file for Stata
user. Fyi,
I succeed running my dataset accordingly approach that use in the nice
article.

In Model ii, by adding the random effects of the clusters (neighbourhoods)
only, I perform a multilevel logistic regression. Adding the neighbourhoods
a random effect considerably increase the DA of the model. If the AU-ROC
increases. This means the neighbourhoods have a relevant (observational)
General Contextual Effect on the individual outcome. That is, knowledge on
the clusters where the individuals reside is relevant for classifying
individuals. That is, for distinguishing those with from those without the
outcome. In Model iii, as expected, the AU-ROC remains similar to Model ii
after including a neighbourhoods level variable as a fixed effect. Model ii
represents the ?ceiling? of the explanatory power of the clusters. However,
particularly both syntax in the steps below, the process taking time very
long, particularly for a data set with the 130,585 observation that I have.

I trust can be replicate the syntax Stata below into the script language of
R under your advice. I want to to know the performance of R to analyse in
the syntax " roccomp".? Unfortunately, the process still not finished in
this step yet at the moment.

AUROC? = Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
ROC? ? = Receiver operating characteristic

r1m2p? = Predicted mean

In addition, I saw in
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auRoc/index.html, and in
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/limma/versions/3.28.14/topics/auROC
,? there is an issue regarding auROC.

Hopefully with install "CRAN - Package auRoc", I can be running the
"roccomp" used the plug-in. In addition, I can compute areas under ROC
curves using the R Commander. However, the R Commander doesn't include ROC
curves, but a Google search suggests that the RcmdrPlugin.EZR, a plug-in
package for the R Commander, includes ROC curves and may do what I want.
Isn't it?


Again thank you very much, I appreciate it.


Best wishes


Hamzah

If nothing else, I think you need to supply some sample data that includes examples of the "forbidden configurations"

 Hi!

I am trying to implement the Morris One at a Time (OAT) sensitivity
analysis technique in R using the package 'sensitivity'.? The OAT and
similar other techniques in the package requires data frame X (which stores
the design or parameter combinations) to be populated by some function in
the package such as fast99 or morris. These functions take only the range
and step size of the parameters as arguments. However, in my experiment
there are few forbidden configurations. Is there a way to specify this in
the analysis set up? To be specific, is there a way to tell the model that
certain combinations are forbidden such as feeding forbidden configurations
via a text file or specifying a conditional expression which will exclude
the forbidden configurations (eg: parameter 1 < parameter 2) ?

Thanks and regards,
Reshma CC

Subject: [R] Adding a new conditional column to a list of dataframes
Message-ID: <DB5PR02MB0904F0F0DA05B29EC41A258D80B10@DB5PR02MB0904.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>


Hi all ..,


I have a list of 7000 dataframes with similar column headers and I wanted to add a new column to each dataframe based on a certain condition which is the same for all dataframes.


When I extract one dataframe and apply my code it works very well as follows :-


First suppose this is my first dataframe in the list

> OneDF <- Mylist[[1]]

> OneDF


ID       Pdate                  Tdate

1         2010-09-30       2011-05-10

2         2011-11-07       2009-09-31

3         2012-01-05        2008-06-23


To add a new column where "C" has to be written in that column only if the date in

"Tdate" column is less than the first date(row) in "Pdate" column.Otherwise "NA" is written.

I have written this code to do so :-


OneDF$NewCol [ OneDF[ ,3] <  OneDF[ 1,2] ] <- "C"


This gave me what I want as follows :-


ID       Pdate                  Tdate                      NewCol

1         2010-09-30       2011-05-10                NA

2         2011-11-07       2009-09-31                  C

3         2012-01-05        2008-06-23                 C


However, when I tried to apply this code in a function and then apply this function

to all dataframes using lapply() function , I do not get what I want.


I wrote this function first :-


MyFunction <- function(x) x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C"


Then I wrote this code to apply my function to all dataframes in "Mylist" :


NewList <- lapply(names(Mylist), function(x) MyFunction(Mylist[[x]]))


This returned a list of 7000 elements and each of which contain "C'' letter. Each

dataframe has become a vector of "C'' letter which is totally away from what I need.

 I expected to see a list of my 7000 dataframes and each of which looks like the output

I have shown above with the new column.


I spent a lot of time trying to know what  is the mistake I have made in these last two codes

but was not able to know the issue.


Could you please let me know my mistake and how to correct my syntax ?


Kind Regards

Allaisone

Your function should return x after modifying it.  As it is, it returns 
the value of x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C", which is "C".  So 
change it to

MyFunction <- function(x) {
   x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C"
   x
}

Your failure to send your question using plain text format means that the mailing list tried to fix that and we are seeing your code all messed up. Please learn how to use your email program... or we may not even be able to figure out your question at all. 

I think you need to pay attention to what your function is returning... whatever is on the last line of the function is key. Try testing your function separately from the lapply to insure you get what you want. Also be sure to use braces when they are needed to define your function.

A function returns the result of the last function call. In your case the last function called was `[<-` and if you look at that function's help page you will find only the value of its RHS (in your case "C") is returned. That assignment function has is predominat action via side-effect rather than by a truly functional operation.. The function might have been written:

 MyFunction <- function(x) { x$NewCol [ x[ ,3] <  x[ 1,2] ] <- "C"; x } # so that x gets returned

I say "might" since you have not included a reproducible example.

Another point: The `$` operator is not ideal for work within functions.

Can you explain more what you plan to do and give an example of what you 
have tried to do until now to do a "break down point" in R. Perhaps a 
"break down point" is common in your field, but I have no idea about 
what it is !

Depends how desperate you are for processing speed and careful you have been with optimizing your own algorithms. The default build of R is IMO quite usable for many people, and without a doubt many complaints about its speed are misdirected and are instead due to poor handling of working memory by the user. Such problems usually dwarf the benefit of having an optimized math library.

Hello everybody,
I have encountered a problem with the inverse Gaussian distribution. It is very likely that it will not work regardless of the data input. I have programmed this regression and it works fine no matter which distribution the response comes from.
If you run this example (first tried and already got the error)
set.seed(1234)
y = abs( rnorm(150) )
glm( y ~ ., iris, family = inverse.gaussian(log) )
You will get this message: 

Error: inner loop 1; cannot correct step size
In addition: Warning message:
step size truncated due to divergence 
?Whom should I talk to about fixing this bug, in some next update of R?

Subject: [R] Help with R-Calling forth csv.
Message-ID: <5ad47997.1c69fb81.3b067.2f64@mx.google.com>

Hi, I'm working on R trying to find a distribution that fits data from a csv file. The csv contains data on pressure exerted by a certain vehicle in terms of pressure [kPa] and I have around 3000 data points. 

I want to call forth this csv and by using (fitdistr) or if you could recommend a function to use, get a plot of my csv and the distributions I can compare it to (Weibull, chi, beta, etc). Now im a complete amateur with the program R, and I can't write a code to call forth the csv with every data point. I?ve been stuck trying to write a code that works for over a week and have not gotten it to work. I've come to the conclusion that this is the only program capable enough to help me plot the distributions to my data, any help is greatly appreciated!

Kind regards

Dear Mohammad

Perhaps if you showed us what you tried people could offer more helpful 
advice? When you say you want to call it forth do you mean you want to 
read in the file using read.csv?

There are plenty of options for reading csv files. For built-in solutions
look at ?read.csv or at read_csv from the package reader.

If the measurements are ordered in columns rather than in rows, reading the
data can be very slow.

said csv files and will attach such Picture to you in this mail and the csv
used. Below I will type the R code I have used for this histogram.

------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

tryck <- read.csv("radmanso_2017.csv", sep=";", dec=",")

##### H??R KOLLAR VI ALLA DATA PUNKTER ######

ggplot(data=tryck, aes(tryck[,1])) +

  geom_histogram(aes(y =..density..),

                 breaks=seq(min(tryck[,1]-1), max(tryck[,1]+1), by = 0.5),

                 col="black",

                 fill="green",

                 alpha = .2) +

  geom_density(col=2) +

  labs(title="Pressure for r?dmans?") +

  labs(x="Pressure [kPa]", y="Amount of vehicles (Percentage)")+

  stat_function(fun=dnorm, colour="blue", args = list(mean =
mean(tryck[,1]), sd = sd(tryck[,1])))



My problem now is to find a statistical distribution that corresponds well
with my histograms with the use of Visual aids, cumulative distributions or
goodness of fit tests which I can?t develope a code for as my csv wont get
called forth and I do not know how to proceed from that Point on to develop
such an aid. If you have any input on how to read the csv file and call
forth a distribution to try on my data points such as Weibull, beta, chi or
gen. Extreme value distributions I would much appreciate the help!



Kind regards,

Mohammad

Message-ID: <A86C6438FB909A409DDEF926277952B6A78077@PPWEXCH2KX14.coh.org>

Hi All..,

I need to do the following repetitive jobs:

seg71 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen71/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg71$id <-"sn71"

seg72 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen72/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg72$id <-"sn72"

seg73 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen73/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg73$id <-"sn73"

seg74 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen74/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg74$id <-"sn74"

seg75 <- read.csv("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen75/seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
seg75$id <-"sn75"

seg <- rbind (seg71, seg72, seg73, seg74, seg75)

I want to write a loop to do it;

For ( d in 71:75) {
  Dir<-paste("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen", i, sep="")
  setwd(Dir)
..........
then I do not know how to create objects seg71 to seg75;  in SAS, it would be  seg&d    ;

I like R, but not good at R.

Can you help me?

Thank you,

Ding

Hello,

The following might do it. Without data it's untested.


wd <- function(i){
     paste0("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen7", i, 
"/seg.pr3.csv")
}

seg <- lapply(1:5, function(i) {
     DF <-read.csv(wd(i))
     DF$id <- paste0("sn7", i)
     DF
})

seg <- do.call(rbind, seg)
row.names(seg) <- NULL


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi Mohammad,
The plot you attached suggests that the underlying distribution may be
a mixture. Is there anything in your data that would explain this,
such as laden/unladen, uphill/downhill, different road surface?

Hello Ding,

try this:

seg <- list()

  s <- paste0("seg",d)
  sn <- paste0("sn",d)
  Dir<-paste("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen", i, sep="")
  setwd(Dir)
  seg[[s]] <- read.csv("seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
  seg[[s]]$id <- sn
}

Hi!

An alternative with 'assign':

for ( i in 71:75) {
? setwd(paste("C:/Awork/geneAssociation/removed8samples/neuhausen", i,
sep=""))
? temp.df<-read.csv("seg.pr3.csv", head=T)
? temp.df$id<-paste0("sn",i,sep="")
? assign(paste0("seg",i,sep=""),temp.df)
}
rm(temp.df,i) ? ?# Clean up

HTH,
Kimmo

Hi all,

I would like to set up an iterative read & write sequence to avoid 
reading and writing each file one at a time.
Hundreds of data sets to re-calculate.? The code I have works well 
individually, but would like to set up an iterative read, calculate and 
write changing the input and output file names each iteration.

I? think I have read that there is an R? feature using "Pipes" and % 
that may help but have not figured out how to do this.
What I am seeking is a way to read a list of TXT files, calculate the 
values and write the results in an iterative manner to avoid manually 
reading each file individually

Suggestions?

Tnx,
Bruce*

Suggestions?

Yes. Don't do this.

Instead, wrap your code in a function, use lapply() to apply it over your
list of files, returning all results in one list, and then save the list in
an .rdata file.

Also, in future, please post in plain text, as html tends to get mangled on
this plain text list .

Hi all,

I would like to set up an iterative read & write sequence to avoid
reading and writing each file one at a time.
Hundreds of data sets to re-calculate.  The code I have works well
individually, but would like to set up an iterative read, calculate and
write changing the input and output file names each iteration.

I  think I have read that there is an R  feature using "Pipes" and %
that may help but have not figured out how to do this.
What I am seeking is a way to read a list of TXT files, calculate the
values and write the results in an iterative manner to avoid manually
reading each file individually

Suggestions?

Tnx,
Bruce*

Dear Bruce,

I'd write a function that take filenames as arguments. It should read
the file, do the calculations and write that output to another file
which can be calculated from the input. You can get all input files in
a directory with e.g. list.files(). Then you can simply loop over the
inputs. Here is some pseudo code.

my_summary <- function(input) {
   raw <- read.table(input)
   summarised <- summary(raw)
   output <- calculate_output(input)
   write.csv(summarised, output)
}
inputs <- list.files("raw/data/path")
sapply(inputs, my_summary)

Likely a spammer has joined the mailing list and is auto-replying to posts made to the list. Unlikely that the list itself has been "hacked". Agree that it is obnoxious.

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone might be able to provide some advice with an nMDS / R problem. I'm trying to run nMDS on a dataset that contains many missing values and was wondering how I can account for the missing values when running nMDS? It seems as though the data are being grouped depending on where the zero values appear. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.

Apologies if this message isn't relevant to you.

Kind regards,

Jessie

Subject: [R] Time intervals in a datframe
Message-ID: <DB5PR02MB090427691DC9588C30B49EC180B70@DB5PR02MB0904.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>


Hi all

I have a list of multiple datframes with the same column headers. The last column in each datframe contains a vector of "Interval" class after I have produced this column using "lubridate" package. I needed to convert my list of dataframes to be in a single dataframe for further analysis. I did this using the following syntax :

SingleDataframe <- ldply (MylistofDFs,data.frame)

The problem is that after this conversion, the the column with time intervals has been converted into numeric type with number of seconds during the time interval instead of the interval itself as follows :

The column Before conversion looks like this:

TimeInterval (class 'interval')
2012-12-13 UTC--2016-02-16 UTC

but after conversion the list into dataframe,
This column becomes number of seconds as follows :

TimeInterval (class : numeric)
100224000

Is there any method to convert my list into a a single dataframe without affecting the types of
vectors in my dataframes?. i.e. I want to keep the interval column as it with avoidance its conversion into numeric when I convert my list of dataframes into a single dataframe... Or at least keep the same format of the interval even if this has been changed to "character" type vector even though I prefer to be in "interval" class.

Any suggestions would be very appreciated.

Regards

I asked the moderators about it. This is the reply

"Other moderators have looked into this a bit and may be able to shed more
light on it. This is a "new" tactic where the spammers appear to reply to
the r-help post. They are not, however, going through the r-help server.

It also seems that this does not happen to everyone.

I am not sure how you can automatically block the spammers.

Sorry I cannot be of more help."

I got some spam emails after my last post to the list, and the emails
did not seem to go through r-help. The spammers may be subscribed to
the r-help, or they get the poster emails from some of the web copies
of this list (nabble or similar).

Hi! 

This happened to me also! I just got a spam email just after posting and then in following days I got obnoxious spam emails in my spam filter.

Just an observation. I have not seen the spam you are discussing. Possibly it is specific to gmail addresses?

Hi! 

This happened to me also! I just got a spam email just after posting and then in following days I got obnoxious spam emails in my spam filter. As the others, I think that there is some kind of bot subscribed to the list, but also perhaps a spider or crawler monitoring the R-Help archive and getting email addresses there. Nabble is a possibility too.

I think you will have to provide some more information. What function/package are you using for nMDS (eg. isoMDS in MASS, monoMDS in vegan)? What function/package are you using to compute your distance/dissimilarities (eg. dist in stats, vegdist in vegan)? 

Zero represents absence. It is not a missing value, so that part of your question is not clear.

The dist() function computes distance ignoring missing values if they are properly represented as NAs in the data. The vegdist() function does this if na.rm=TRUE. 

The results will be affected by how much data is missing. It would be useful to know if the missing values are concentrated in particular rows or columns so that eliminating a few rows and columns could substantially reduce the percentage of missing values.

Subject: [R] nMDS with R: missing values

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone might be able to provide some advice with an nMDS / R problem. I?m trying to run nMDS on a dataset that contains many missing values and was wondering how I can account for the missing values when running nMDS? It seems as though the data are being grouped depending on where the zero values appear. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.

Apologies if this message isn?t relevant to you.

Kind regards,

Jessie

There is no base R class called "interval". Perhaps lubridate has not provided you with an `ldply( . ,data.frame)`-accessible method for concatenation. You should construct an example that starts with the loading code for whatever package(s) are being used.

Many thank David ..,


Yes , correct, the class "interval" is a special class belongs to the package "lubridate" and
is not a base R class.

I have just found a solution and happy to share it :-

using an alternative conversion method with the use of "rbind" instead of
"ldplyr " method will keep the converted dataframe with the same "interval' class as follows :-

MySingleDF <- do.call("rbind",MyList)

Regards

the R-list.

Hi!

Not just an gmail issue. After my last reply I have gotten tons of
spams from "Samantha Smith". Keep hitting my "rank as spam"-button in
the hope that my MUA could learn :)

Best,
Kimmo

I don?t think that it?s a just a gmail issue. If some of you aren?t receiving those emails is probably because they get caught in your organization spam filter and they don?t reach you. 

Every time I write to the list I receive those messages.

Thank you Peter (and Ulrich and ..),

>From all the cases we (R-help-owner = your friendly volunteer
list moderators) checked,

1) the address from which the spam was sent  was *NOT* among the
   13'000 subscriber addresses to R-help

2) in one case, I replied to the address stating that it
   seemed that *e-mail account* had been hacked.
   The result was nil (NULL), i.e., my conclusion was

   a) the address was a really registered/existing e-mail address that gave
      no "mailer daemon" error 

   b) it probably did go to the spammers: a legitimate user
      would have replied to me.

Subject: [R] Event-triggered change in value with a time-delay
Message-ID: <CAE6OfuqDuKZ+7yey3LLa7a+LSxv3HwO2ZaMR___G4h5YM+L=Pg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am solving a set of ODEs using deSolve and have run into a problem I
would appreciate some advice on. One of the parameters (m) in the ODEs
changes between two states when one of the variables (D) crosses a
threshold (D_T) for the first time in either direction. Additionally, when
the variable crosses the threshold (either by increasing or decreasing),
there is a time delay (delay) before the parameter shifts values.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Toy model:
# define parameters
P <- c(m = 10,
       R_1 = 0.5,
       R_2 = 0.1,
       D_0 = 50,
       D_T = 5,
       delay = 3
)
# set initial values
y_0 <- c(D = 0, Y = 1)

# set timesteps
times <- seq(0, 100, length = 101)

# define function
bit <- function(t,y,parms){
  with(as.list(c(parms,y)),{


    # How I would implement the change if there was no time delay
    # m <- ifelse(D>=D_T, m*.68, m)

    # Option 1: nested if statements with time delay
    # if (D >= D_T) {
    #   t_start1 <- t + delay
    #   if (t >= t_start1){
    #     m <- 6.8
    #   }
    # }
    # if (D < D_T) {
    #   t_start2<- t + delay
    #   if (t >= t_start2){
    #     m <- 10
    #   }
    # }


    dD <- D_0 * (R_1 / (R_1 - R_2)) * (-R_2 * exp(-R_2 * t) + R_1 *
exp(-R_1 * t))
    dY <- Y + m;
    res <- c(dD, dY)
    list(res, m = m)
  })
}


# Solve model
library(deSolve)
out <- ode(y = y_0, times = times, func = bit, parms = P)
out.df <- as.data.frame(out)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have come up with a number of ideas, but I either haven't been able to
get them to work or don't know if R has a command for it:

1. Nested "if" statements with something to track time (as shown above).
One issue here is* t-start *is redefined with each time step in the ode
solver so *t* never reaches *t_start +delay*.

2. Event triggered changes. From the examples I have found (link
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/vignettes/deSolve.pdf> p.
24-25), the time at which the event happens is either pre-set or occurs at
a root of the ODE.  Also- would this strategy require multiple events? One
event in which the variable crossing the threshold triggers a timer,
another for the timer triggering the parameter change?

3. Lagvalue. This might take care of the time lag component, but I am still
struggling to understand (1) how lagvalue works and (2) how to integrate
both the threshold and timer components.

   if ( D < D_T )
     m<- ifelse(lagvalue(t-delay)<=0, 6.8, 10)
   end

4. Sigmoidal function. Someone suggested this to me earlier, but I am not
sure how this would work. Is it possible to have a sigmoidal function that
switches repeatedly between two states (as opposed to the characteristic S
curve that transitions once from one state to another)?

5. Mathmematica has a WhenEvent function- is there something similar in R?


Thank you for your time and any tips you might have!

Hi!

This happened to me also! I just got a spam email just after posting and then in following days I got obnoxious spam emails in my spam filter. As the others, I think that there is some kind of bot subscribed to the list, but also perhaps a spider or crawler monitoring the R-Help archive and getting email addresses there. Nabble is a possibility too.

Likely a spammer has joined the mailing list and is auto-replying to

Dear All,

Here is a reprex:

> x[-which(x>100)]
integer(0)

In words, I am finding out which indices correspond to values in x which
are  greater than  100 ( there are no such items ) . Then I remove those
indices. I should get back the x that I started with since there are no
items in x which are bigger than 100 . Instead, it is returning an empty
vector.

Why is this ? What am I misunderstanding?

Here's a hint:

# TRUE

The '-' is misleading - it is absorbed into the empty y, leaving the
request x[y] to be x for an empty set of indices.

Look at

which(x>100)

This is a zero-length vector. The negative of nothing is nothing, not a list of all possible index values.

Do you want

x[ !( x > 100 ) ]

?

Subject: [R] mgcv::gamm error when combining random smooths and
 correlation/autoregressive term
Message-ID: <B9A0D117-B6AB-42E7-9630-E0D21294DC90@gmail.com>

I am having difficulty fitting a mgcv::gamm model that includes both a random smooth term (i.e. 'fs' smooth) and autoregressive errors.  Standard smooth terms with a factor interaction using the 'by=' option work fine.  Both on my actual data and a toy example (below) I am getting the same error so am inclined to wonder if this is either a bug or a model that gamm is simply unable to fit?

Any insight or suggestions would be much appreciated.

M


Example:

library('mgcv')
set.seed(1)
df = data.frame(index=rep(1:10,5), x=runif(50,0,1), subject = as.factor(sort(rep(1:5,10))))

# random intercept
m1 = gamm(x~s(index), random=list(subject=~1), data=df, method = 'REML')

#factor interaction, random intercept, AR errors
m2 = gamm(x~s(index, by=subject), random=list(subject=~1), correlation=corAR1(form=~index|subject), data=df, method = 'REML')

#factor interaction, random intercept and slope, AR errors
m3 = gamm(x~s(index, by=subject), random=list(subject=~index), correlation=corAR1(form=~index|subject), data=df, method = 'REML')

#random smooth on its own works ok
m4 = gamm(x~s(index, subject, bs='fs'), data=df, method = 'REML')


#combination of 'fs' smooth and AR term generates the error: "Error in matrix(0, size.cg[i], size.cg[i]) : object 'size.cg' not found"
#the grouping term ( |subject ) is redundant in corAR1 as the mgcv documentation indicates that gamm will assume the grouping 
#from the random smooth term; the same error happens irrespective of whether the grouping is included in corAR1 or not.

m5 = gamm(x~s(index, subject, bs='fs'), correlation=corAR1(form=~index|subject), data=df, method = 'REML')

abline(SimpleLinearReg1, col="red")
mean(Age)
mean(BloodPressure)
abline(h=142.53, col="green")
abline(v=45.13, col="green")

But I cannot get the regression line. Can anybody tell me what's wrong with the codes ? I would appreciate very much. Thanks for any help.

Subject: [R] Reasons to Use R in a Public Administrations and Ideas for a
 Short Training
Message-ID: <20180418134721.aucxmerudjxk6hlj@chicca2>

Dear All,
Ages ago I posted to this mailing list asking for advice about to
evangelize the use of R in an international public
administration where the fact that R is free is not a decisive factor
(actually its being "freeware" may even be seen negatively). After a
long time, I think it is worthwhile asking the question again and see
what suggestions other users have.

Another question related to that: let's say you have the possibility
to give a short course (most likely short of 10 hours) to people
who are not trained in statistics (people with a background in
international relations or political scientists frustrated at Excel
and who sometimes have to do a number of repetitive tasks). How would
you formulate a short training to make them not R proficient users,
but aware and looking forward to learning more about R?
Any suggestion and/or pointer to online resources is appreciated.
Many thanks

Lorenzo

I'm not sure how you are incorporating time period into your data structure. Typically we are looking at plots or assemblages as the rows and taxa as the columns. Time period adds a third dimension that could be added as blocks of rows. For example, depending on the resolution of your data, one approach would be to have up to 8 rows for each locality: Loc1.1000, Loc1.2000, . . . Loc1.8000. If a locality did not have certain millennia represented you would just leave them out.

Subject: RE: nMDS with R: missing values

Dear Prof Carlson,

Thank you for your reply. I'm using 'vegan' with 'vegdist' and 'bray'. I have a selection of datasets that cover different time periods (converted to z-scores), so a record that starts 5000 years ago would have missing data before this date when other records cover the last 8000 years. I need to build into the nMDS the fact that this isn't a zero score, but reflects absence of data. In the results it seems that datasets that cover the same time periods are being grouped together because they have zero values at the same times. I hope that makes sense. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

There is no regular pattern to the position of the missing values, so I can't remove certain rows or columns. Thank you for the suggestion of using dist() and na.rm=TRUE. I will try using these approaches.

Kind regards,

Jessie

I think you will have to provide some more information. What function/package are you using for nMDS (eg. isoMDS in MASS, monoMDS in vegan)? What function/package are you using to compute your distance/dissimilarities (eg. dist in stats, vegdist in vegan)?

Zero represents absence. It is not a missing value, so that part of your question is not clear.

The dist() function computes distance ignoring missing values if they are properly represented as NAs in the data. The vegdist() function does this if na.rm=TRUE.

The results will be affected by how much data is missing. It would be useful to know if the missing values are concentrated in particular rows or columns so that eliminating a few rows and columns could substantially reduce the percentage of missing values.

Subject: [R] nMDS with R: missing values

Dear All,

I was wondering whether anyone might be able to provide some advice with an nMDS / R problem. I?m trying to run nMDS on a dataset that contains many missing values and was wondering how I can account for the missing values when running nMDS? It seems as though the data are being grouped depending on where the zero values appear. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.

Apologies if this message isn?t relevant to you.

Kind regards,

Jessie

Not necessarily. The R-help archives are publicly accessible,
with a "sort by date" option. So if someone sets up a web=page
monitor which reports back when new messages appear there
(at the bpottom end), then their email addresses are readily
copied (subject to " at " --> "@".

Once they have the address then anything can happen!

Best wishes,
Ted (eagerly awaiting attempted seduction ... ).

As the others, I think that there is some kind of bot subscribed to the list, but also perhaps a spider or crawler monitoring the R-Help archive and getting email addresses there. Nabble is a possibility too.

Hi, Anne,

assign Age and Bloodpressure in the correct order
to the axes in your call to plot as in:

plot(y = Age, x = BloodPressure)
abline(SimpleLinearReg1)

Courses are good for people who are motivated to learn. It sounds like you need to generate the motivation first. Why not develop 4 - 5 case study examples? Kinds of analyses currently performed on Excel that would be easier to replicate and repeat using simple R scripts so that you are showing how it would be done in Excel and then how it would be done in R structuring the code so that running a similar analysis requires only minor adjustments in contrast to Excel which might involve copying formula blocks into a new spreadsheet tab or creating templates that fail and are hard to debug.

Subject: [R] Reasons to Use R in a Public Administrations and Ideas for a Short Training

Dear All,
Ages ago I posted to this mailing list asking for advice about to evangelize the use of R in an international public administration where the fact that R is free is not a decisive factor (actually its being "freeware" may even be seen negatively). After a long time, I think it is worthwhile asking the question again and see what suggestions other users have.

Another question related to that: let's say you have the possibility to give a short course (most likely short of 10 hours) to people who are not trained in statistics (people with a background in international relations or political scientists frustrated at Excel and who sometimes have to do a number of repetitive tasks). How would you formulate a short training to make them not R proficient users, but aware and looking forward to learning more about R?
Any suggestion and/or pointer to online resources is appreciated.
Many thanks

Lorenzo

Hi Anne,
I would suggest to change the linear model to lm(BloodPressure~Age), as
this model makes more sense in biological means (you would assume that
age influences pressure, not vice versa) and also obeys the statistical
assumption of weak exogeneity, that age can be measured without error,
at least compared to error-prone bp measures.

Cheers

To expand on Eik Vettorazzi's answer:

Don't use html emails. When the mailing list converts it to plain text, it often re-wraps lines so that your code becomes jumbled.

First, you did not define coeff. You need to add

coeff <- coef(SimpleLinearReg1)

Second, you should use the formula you used for the regression in the plot command or the correct order (plot uses the first variable as the x-axis and the second variable as the y-axis while the formula specification uses the variable on the left of the tilde (~) as the y-axis and the variable on the right of the tilde as the x-axis. Your regression predicts age (response) from blood pressure (explanatory) so abline() assumes age is on the y-axis and blood pressure is on the x-axis, but you reversed that so the line is "plotted", but it is outside the plot window. 

Either change the regression formula to BloodPressure~Age (which makes more sense than predicting age from blood pressure) or change the plot command to plot(BloodPressure, Age, ...) and change the xlab to ylab and ylab to xlab).

Hi Anne,
I would suggest to change the linear model to lm(BloodPressure~Age), as this model makes more sense in biological means (you would assume that age influences pressure, not vice versa) and also obeys the statistical assumption of weak exogeneity, that age can be measured without error, at least compared to error-prone bp measures.

Cheers

Hi Gerrit!
Thank you so much! I mistakenly reversed the order of the variables of the regression. Actually what I meant to write was: lm(BloodPressure ~ Age).
Best,
Anne

Hi, Anne,

assign Age and Bloodpressure in the correct order to the axes in your call to plot as in:

plot(y = Age, x = BloodPressure)
abline(SimpleLinearReg1)

I think you migh not have fully reviewed the available functions in that package. Doing an sos::findFn-search on ODE's with time delay brings up help pages for the `dede` function in deSolve. 

For the conditional value of the within regime-fixed parameter `m`, couldn't you just use this:

    ... + m*(6.8+ 3.2*(D < D_T))

Caveat: very lightly tested in your toy example, which did generate a result where D cross that threshold without blowing up.

I would recommend that you avoid converting (or letting R convert for you) your textual data values into factors until you have finished doing this kind of modification.

You can restore the column to character data type either re-reading it with the stringsAsFactors=FALSE option to read.table/read.csv functions, or by converting it:

dat[[ 3 ]] <- as.character( dat[[ 3 ]] )

and then your replacement will work.

The simplest would be to convert precip to character and then back to a factor if you really want it to be a factor. This will also remove the levels that no longer exist.

str(dat)
# 'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ Sites : Factor w/ 5 levels "Site1","Site2",..: 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ temp  : num  14 15 12 12.5 17
#  $ precip: Factor w/ 5 levels "15","34","high",..: 3 4 5 2 1

dat$precip <- as.character(dat$precip)
dat[4:5, 3] <-"20"
dat$precip <- factor(dat$precip)

str(dat)
# 'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ Sites : Factor w/ 5 levels "Site1","Site2",..: 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ temp  : num  14 15 12 12.5 17
#  $ precip: Factor w/ 4 levels "20","high","low",..: 2 3 4 1 1

Hi David and Jeff,
Both ways worked for my table. it helped me a lot (I was really struggling
on it to change the values and thinking to do manually). You are great.
Thank you

HI All,

I found that other R users experienced the same problem when using sqldf package. An expert provided solution, adding "method="raw" at the end as below, one or more of the columns in my data.frame are of class "AsIs" ( I don't know what it is) .  When sqldf retrieves the result from SQLite it will be numeric or character and since it was originally of class AsIs,  it tries to convert it back but R provides no as.AsIs,  so it fails; use method = "raw", so sqldf will not try to convert  the results from the database.

DMRlog2pbde47DMS <- sqldf("select * from DMR_log2pbde47 as a left join DMS_log2pbde47 as b 
                           on a.chrom = b.chromo and a.start <= b.MAPINFO and a.end >= b.MAPINFO", method = "raw" )

Dear R users,

I need to merge two data frames based on both equal and unequal comparisons.  The "sqldf" package used to work well , but today, I cannot resolve the following error by reinstallation of the sqldf package.   Can anyone suggest a different way to perform this kind of merge function?

Thank you,

Hello,
I have a data frame with 400 columns and wanted to filter character columns with "$" in it.For example:?>? x <- c("$5", "$89", "$10", "$34")??>? y <- c(1:4)>? My.Data <- data.frame (x,y)> My.Data? ? x y1? $5 12 $89 23 $10 34 $34 4
I want to detect the columns with $ and remove the $ from the selected columns.I have tried?apply(My.Data, 2, function (x) any(grepl("$", x))) but it's not really working.Or:??apply(My.Data, 2, function(x){x<-gsub("\\$", "", x)}) works but it turns all the columns to a factor.
Thanks.

Hi Farnoosh,
Perhaps this will help:

drop_dollar<-function(x) return(as.numeric(as.character(gsub("\\$","",x))))
sapply(My.Data,drop_dollar)

Your message came through all messed up because you did not tell your email program to use plain text format. This at best delays a responds and at worst prevents us from understanding your question as you intended.

1) The columns became factors when you created the data frame because you did not include the stringsAsFactors=FALSE argument. The apply function does NOT turn the columns to factors. 

2) Your use of "x <-" in your apply function is misleading, though not destructive. Just omit that assignment. 

dta2 <- apply(My.Data, 2, function (x) gsub("\\$", "", x)))

Hello,

To the OP:
The dollar sign is a meta character, so it must be escaped, that is what 
was wrong with your code. The right regular expression would be

grepl("\\$", x)

When a regular expression doesn't work, try reading the help page ?regex.

Another good source you can try is

https://regex101.com


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi all,

I am looking for syntax to read a list of *txt files, (loop through?) 
each with a different data content but same fields, then run lines of 
code to produce summary stats (I have working code for this) and add the 
matching data file name when writing the results of a line of R code.?? 
Suggestions on any package vignettes that may be useful welcomed.

My manual code for this is below and need to understand how to have the 
"DataFile" name changed to match the name of each data file as it is 
read and processed.

*write.csv(BatStats,file="C:\\=Bat data working\\Acoustic 
Parameters\\DataFile_Stats.csv")*

I need your help because I am having difficulties to finalize an econometric model.By the way, I want to calculate the standard error with delta method in a 2sls model with interactions under R.I want to determine the total effect of the institutions (Institutions + D_MinMond * Institutions) on logYLby summing the estimated parameters of (Institutions) and (D_MinMond * Institutions);D_MinMond is a dummy taking 0 or 1. But I can not find the right code to calculate the standard error under RHere is the equation for this estimate:reg_iv2<-ivreg(logYL~Institutions+D_MinMond+D_MinMondInstitutions|xconst+xrreg+D_MinMond+D_MinMondInstitutions,data=bdd2)

Dear Lorenzo,

First of all I would focus on topics which immediately usable by your
audience. E.g. making figures and tables based on preprocessed data
files (txt, Excel, GoogleSheets, data base query, ...). And pick
examples in which the definition of the figures and tables remains
more or less stable but the data is updated with some frequency. In a
next step you could focus on processing the data.

I would even skip the step of writing R scripts and start with basic R
notebooks. The ability to include both plain text and code into one
source document is very useful for repetitive tasks. And you
significantly reduce the need to copy/paste results.

Think about a list of packages which you can recommend to your
audience. I would consider the tidyverse collection.

Hello,

You can process several files at a time with repeated use of *appy 
functions. Something like the following (not tested).


# This first instruction may not be needed
old_dir <- setwd("path/to/txt/files")

# Get the filenames in a vector and read them in
txt_files <- list.files(pattern = ".*\\.txt")
txt_list <- lapply(txt_files, read.table, args)


In the above lapply command, args are the arguments to read.table. For 
instance, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, etc.

Now put your summary stats code in a function and run it through the 
data.frames in the list. Then save the results as csv files.


stats_list <- lapply(txt_list, summary_stats_function)

csv_files <- sub("txt", "csv", txt_files)
lapply(seq_along(csv_files), function(i) write.csv(stats_list[[i]], 
csv_files[i]))

setwd(old_dir)    # reset, if needed


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi,

I think he's talking about how much a statistical estimator is influenced by extreme datapoints, e.g.

A few years ago I gave two 5-hour workshops about R to a class of US high
school students in a somewhat-accelerated science research class (so these
were already science-motivated kids).  They had been using mainly Excel,
and some SPSS for which the school had a license.  Overall they seemed to
like the sessions. They started a computer programming club afterward, and
some continued to use R.

As for motivation, I found it helpful with the kids to contrast the
instructions for making a scatterplot in Excel, with the command in R.  You
can find many long documents on the internet describing how to do it in
Excel. Find a long one (I've seen 17 pages) filled with screenshots and
many numbered steps ("click here, then click there, then click over here .
. . ")  Then contrast it with something like plot(force, acceleration) or
plot(x,y)   It becomes pretty clear which is easier (postponing, for the
moment, the question of where x and y came from)

Showing cool graphs that could never be made in Excel is also helpful.

Lastly, in the international setting you describe, I would emphasize the
portability of code. Ask them how, with Excel, they would share their
analysis steps with colleagues in another country, for application to the
colleagues' data.

Message-ID: <A86C6438FB909A409DDEF926277952B6A7F177@PPWEXCH2KX14.coh.org>

Hi All,

I want to create a categorical variable, cat.pfoa, in the file of pfas.pheno (a data frame) based on log2pfoa values. I can do it using the following code.

pfas.pheno <-within(pfas.pheno, {cat.pfoa<-NA
  cat.pfoa[pfas.pheno$log2pfoa <=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.25, na.rm =T)]<-0
  cat.pfoa[pfas.pheno$log2pfoa >=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.75, na.rm =T)]<-2
  cat.pfoa[pfas.pheno$log2pfoa >=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.25, na.rm =T)
           &pfas.pheno$log2pfoa <=quantile(pfas.pheno$log2pfoa,0.75, na.rm =T)]<-1
  }

However, I have additional 7 similar variables, so I wrote the following code, but it does not work.

for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh", "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
pfas.pheno <- within(pfas.pheno, {eval(parse(text= cat.var))<-NA
eval(parse(text=cat.var))[pfas.pheno[,i] <= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.25, na.rm =T)] <- 0
eval(parse(text=cat.var))[pfas.pheno[,i] >= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.75, na.rm =T)] <- 2
eval(parse(text=cat.var))[pfas.pheno[,i] >= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.25, na.rm =T)
                                  &pfas.pheno[,i] <= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.75, na.rm =T)] < -1
})
                                                                                  }

Can you help me fix the problem?

Thank you,

Hello,

When programming it is better to use dat[["variable"]] than dat$variable.

So your code could be

pfas.pheno[[cat.var]] <- NA
pfas.pheno[[cat.var]][pfas.pheno[,i] <= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.25, 
na.rm =T)] <- 0

etc.

Untested.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

[Attention: This email came from an external source. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or unexpected emails.]





Hello,

When programming it is better to use dat[["variable"]] than dat$variable.

So your code could be

pfas.pheno[[cat.var]] <- NA
pfas.pheno[[cat.var]][pfas.pheno[,i] <= quantile(pfas.pheno[,i],0.25, na.rm =T)] <- 0

etc.

Untested.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

This would be somewhat more compact and easier to maintain if you used findInterval (untested in the absence of a data object, which is your responsibility):

pfas.pheno <-within(pfas.pheno, {
 cat.pfoa  <- findInterval( log2pfoa , c(-Inf, quantile( log2pfoa,c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } )
 

`findInterval` numbers its intervals from 1, so to get a sequence starting at 0 just subtract 1.

Nope. Cannot use R like a macro processor, at least not easily. R names are not the same as character vlaues. They "live in different realities". The `get` and `assign` functions can be used to "promote" character values to real R names and make assignments from and to what would otherwise be merely character values.

Perhaps this (also mostly untested (except for the strategy of making `assign` creat a new dataframe column:

 for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh",  
             "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
  cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
  assign( cat.var, findInterval( get(i) , c(-Inf, quantile( get(i), c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } ),  
                   envir=as.environment( get( pfas.pheno ) ) )

Best;
David.

That wasn't good advice. I would rather suggest (but still untested in the absence of a good demo dataset from the OP):

for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh",  
            "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
 cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
 pfas.pheno[[ cat.var ]] <-  findInterval( get(i) , c(-Inf, quantile( get(i), c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } 

The "[[<-" function supports character values as column names during assignment.

Definitely!  Thank you, Olivier.

I had not replied because the question looked more like homework
than something for which R-help is appropropriate.

There is the 'robustbase' package and more of a dozen other high
quality R packages about robust statistics -- in which
"breakdown point" is one crucial concept.

BTW: What econometricians tend to call "robust" is the idea
of using "sandwich" estimates (--> 'sandwich' package in R), aka
Newey-West aka HAC (Heteroscadisticity And Correlation adjusted) estimates.

Robust statistics in a proper sense considers "sensitivity" of
both estimates and their precision estimates in situations where
the distributional assumption (e.g. Gaussian errors) is only
approximately true, say 95% of the observations/errors/.. are Gaussian but the
remaining 5% can be anything (-> arbitrary extreme outliers).

There's the CRAN task view on robust statistical methods:

Subject: [R] Problem reading R files
Message-ID: <CAEv8Y-1Uyaw0op4ZGMHSM=F5jdfrAsUM1fyMpzjOvWwtGwAWtw@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear R Developers,

I hope this email finds you well.

As a newcomer to the world of R, I'm trying different exercises. In my way,
I faced with some, seemingly, trivial problems but there is not any
response for that around the web. So, I thought can get help from you.
Specifically, in tutorial presented at http://www.rdatamining.com/doc
s/twitter-analysis-with-r,  I faced with a problem on using OAuth. When I
use the first approach, the following error will be occurred:

[1] "Using browser based authentication"
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) :
  Failed to connect to api.twitter.com port 443: Connection refused


And when it comes to the second approach, the following error rises:

[1] "Using direct authentication"
Error in check_twitter_oauth() : OAuth authentication error:
This most likely means that you have incorrectly called
setup_twitter_oauth()'

Unfortunately, the online resources could not help. For example, all the
solutions introduced in StackOverflow could not work for me.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31128492/twitter-setup-t
witter-oauth-failing

*Moreover, in reading data from the current directory, the readRDS method
sucks*. I got same error using import() in rio package.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49908803/error-in-reading-files-in-r

So, please  let me know if you have some solution for the issues.

Thanks for your consideration.

Regards,

Jack

Hi R folks,
In my previous post I forgot to mention that I was new to R. I was really grateful for your quick help. I have two further questions:
1) In the graph of a regression line I would like to show one specific residual yi obs - yi pred (let's take the person whose residual is 76). How do I add a bracket to this vertical distance and name it? I'am getting stuck after the "textxy" function.
Age <- c(39, 47, 45, 47, 65, 46, 67, 42, 67, 56, 64, 56, 59, 34, 42, 48, 45,

plot(Age, BloodPressure, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", 
main = "Graphe de la relation entre l'?ge et la pression art?rielle", 
xlab = "Age (ann?e)", ylab = "Pression art?rielle (mmHg)")
abline(SimpleLinearReg1, col="red")
res <- signif(residuals(SimpleLinearReg1), 2)
pre <- predict(SimpleLinearReg1) 
segments(Age, BloodPressure, Age, pre, col="red")
library(calibrate)
textxy(Age, BloodPressure, res, cex=0.7) 2) 

2) I also need your help plotting a hyperplan for a multiple regression and here I am really stuck...
inc <- c(25000, 28000, 17500, 30000, 25000, 32000, 30000, 29000, 26000, 40000)
age <- c(60, 36, 21, 35, 33, 43, 29, 45, 41, 48)
educ <- c(12, 12, 13, 16, 16, 12, 13, 15, 15, 20)
MultLinearReg1 <- lm(inc ~ age + educ)
summary(MultLinearReg1)

Thank you so much!

Hello, Anne,

just a few quick hints because I need to run.

First, try to format you R-code in emails like this
with adequate line breaks.

Second, if you boil down your problem to the crucial point
(and not just pack an email with very specific code) more
people may be more willing to respond.

Third, just to be sure: This list is not for home work.

Two more remarks see inline below.

I don't understand what mean by "to add a bracket", but why
don't you just place a "name" next to the vertical line at
residual # 76 using the function text?

This is a bit more complicated. Learn, e.g., about function persp
or search for "plot regression surface with r" and find, e.g.,
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7863906/plot-regression-surface#7864088 
as the first hit.

That wasn't good advice. I would rather suggest (but still untested in the absence of a good demo dataset from the OP):

for (i in c("log2pfoa","log2pfos", "log2pfna", "log2pfdea",   "log2pfuda", "log2pfhxs", "log2et_pfosa_acoh",  
            "log2me_pfosa_acoh"))  {
 cat.var <- paste0("cat.",i)
 pfas.pheno[[ cat.var ]] <-  findInterval( get(i) , c(-Inf, quantile( get(i), c(.25,.75), Inf), na.rm =T), Inf)]-1 } 

The "[[<-" function supports character values as column names during assignment.

Looks like you have not obtained a proper Twitter account and obtained a valid registration code to use the API. That should have been covered in your course materials.

That posting describes entirely different issue. The first issue was that the file wasn't where you thought it was and the second error message that you posted in comments said it was the wrong format for the readRDS function.

There are two files with that name listed on the website and only one of them loads properly with readRDS.

Subject: [R] Check if row of dataframe is superset of any row in another
 dataframe.
Message-ID: <CAMe08vun6haoQA_3iNmc1gcqYLtxz+2FDRPEnZYRPkVhZskG4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am looking for a way in which I can check if rows in 1 dataframe are
present in another data frame in a unique way. A row in dataframe should be
super set of any row in another dataframe.

I can write a for loop for it, however, that will be inefficient. So, I am
looking for an efficient way to do this in R.

I have explained it with an example below:

I want to check if a row in dataframe B is:
1) either equal to any row in A or
2) has 1's atleast for the columns where (any) row in B has 1's.

My output/result is a vector of 1(TRUE) or 0(FALSE) of length equal to
number of rows in B. The first row in B is exactly present in A so result
has first bit as 1. Second row in B has matches with 2nd row of dataframe A
(it has an extra 1 in 3rd column,which is ok);so second bit of result is
also 1. Similarly, the 3rd row of B, can match to any row in A, so 3rd bit
in result is also a 1. Next, 4th row in B has 1 for a column where no row
in A has 1, so last bit in result is 0.

Dataframe A
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0

Dataframe B
1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1

Result<- 1 1 1 0

Thanks for the help,
Neha

B <- as.matrix(B)

C   <- A %*% t(B)
SA  <- apply(A, MAR=1, sum )
SB  <- apply(B, MAR=1, sum )
vapply( 1:nrow(B), function(j) { sum( C[,j]==SA & SA <= SB[j] ) > 0 }, 1 )

HTH,
Eric

Hi Neha,
How about this?

find_subset<-function(x,y) {
 yrows<-dim(y)[1]
 match<-0
 for(row in 1:yrows) match<-sum(x&y[row]) >= sum(y[row])
 return(match)
}
apply(B,1,find_subset,A)

This is somewhat obscure, as the dataframe B is coerced to a matrix by
the apply function.

Message-ID: <CAEZF6yyQO0KbD2tJeWP+2KO-dMj_W1czHqGPjioctGjJLwz+jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!
I am trying to fit a copula to some data in R and I get the error mentioned
above. This is the code for a reproducible example -

library(copula)
data = matrix(data=runif(600),nrow=200,ncol=3)
data[,2] = 2*data[,1]
data[,3] = 3*data[,1]
fr_cop = frankCopula(dim=3)
fit_fr_cop = fitCopula(fr_cop,pobs(data),method = "mpl") #Error Here

The error says : Error in fitCopula.ml(copula, u = data, method = method,
start = start, : 'start' contains NA values

What could be going wrong?

(not really reproducible: You did not set the random seed, so
 the data is different every time;
 OTOH, yes, the following always gives an error)

    > library(copula)

Slightly clearer showing what you are doing:

    x <- runif(200)
    data <- cbind(x, 2*x, 3*x)

    > fr_cop = frankCopula(dim=3)
    > fit_fr_cop = fitCopula(fr_cop, pobs(data), method = "mpl") #Error Here

    > What could be going wrong?

Is this a homework question? [probably not, but ..]

The homework question & answer would be

Q:  What is the best fitting 3D copula if you have perfectly
    correlated ("rank 1") data?

A:  The complete-dependence copula ... which is indeed a boundary case,
    hard to imagine you'd encounter for non-artifical data.

Another hint:

> fitCopula(normalCopula(,3), pobs(data))
Call: fitCopula(copula, data = data)
Fit based on "maximum pseudo-likelihood" and 200 3-dimensional observations.
Copula: normalCopula 
rho.1 
    1 
The maximized loglikelihood is 3686 
Optimization converged
>
-----------

Yes, one could adapt the fitCopula() code to work better for
this extreme boundary case,
and for the Frank copula,  it would return

> fitCopula(frankCopula(,3), pobs(data))
Call: fitCopula(copula, data = data)
Fit based on "maximum pseudo-likelihood" and 200 3-dimensional observations.
Copula: frankCopula 
   alpha 
7.21e+16 
The maximized loglikelihood is 1.798e+308 
Optimization converged


but it would need even more tweaking to also give such
  "alpha ~= +Inf"
results for other cases such as Gumbel or Joe.

I may add the possibility for frank*() as shown above for the
next release of the copula package...
but am a bit hesitant to complicate (and slowdown) the current
code by adding an extra check for this situation.

Subject: [R] Cross-validation : can't get the predicted response on the

Dear R-experts,

Doing cross-validation for 2 robust regressions (HBR and fast Tau). I can't get the 2 errors rates (RMSE and MAPE). The problem is to predict the response on the testing data. I get 2 error messages. 
Here below the reproducible (fictional example) R code.

#install.packages("MLmetrics")
# install.packages( "robustbase" )
# install.packages( "MASS" )
# install.packages( "quantreg" )
# install.packages( "RobPer" )
# install.packages( "scatterplot3d" )
# install.packages("devtools")? # library("devtools") # install_github("kloke/hbrfit") #install.packages('http://www.stat.wmich.edu/mckean/Stat666/Pkgs/npsmReg2_0.1.1.tar.gz') 

library(robustbase)
library(MASS)
library(quantreg)
library(RobPer)
library(scatterplot3d)
library(hbrfit)
library(MLmetrics)?

# numeric variables
A=c(2,3,4,3,2,6,5,6,4,3,5,55,6,5,4,5,6,6,7,52)
B= c(45,43,23,47,65,21,12,7,18,29,56,45,34,23,12,65,4,34,54,23)
C=c(21,54,34,12,4,56,74,3,12,71,14,15,63,34,35,23,24,21,69,32)

# Create a dataframe
BIO<-data.frame(A,B,C)
? 
# randomize sampling seed
set.seed(1)
n=dim(BIO)[1] 
p=0.667

# Sample size
sam=sample(1?:n,floor(p*n),replace=FALSE)

# Sample training data
Training =BIO [sam,]

# Sample testing data
Testing = BIO [-sam,]
? 
# Build the 2 models 
fit<- FastTau(model.matrix(~Training$A+Training$B),Training$C)
HBR<-hbrfit(C ~ A+B)

# Predict the response on the testing data
ypred=predict(fit,newdata=Testing)
ypred=predict(HBR,newdata=Testing)

# Get the true response from testing data
y=BIO[-sam,]$D

?# Get error rate
RMSE=sqrt(mean((y-ypred)^2))
RMSE
MAPE = mean(abs(y-ypred/y))
MAPE

Subject: [R] Removing columns from big.matrix which have only one value
Message-ID: <CADbGCVj_NwwubSESQwTtHna_J==Ane7cWVhNq4PzgPA76q57Zw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a very large binary matrix, stored as a big.matrix to conserve
memory (it is over 2 gb otherwise - 5 million columns and 100 rows).

r <- 100
c <- 10000
m4 <- matrix(sample(0:1,r*c, replace=TRUE),r,c)
m4 <- cbind(m4, 1)
m4 <- as.big.matrix(m4)

I need to remove every column which has only one unique value (in this
case, only 0s or only 1s). Because of the number of columns, I want to be
able to do this in parallel.

How can I accomplish this while keeping the data compressed as a
big.matrix? I can convert it into a df and loop over the columns looking
for the number of unique values, but this takes too much RAM.

Thanks!

Maybe base R's  unique() function might be useful? It uses hashing I
believe.

Hi Martin,
Thanks for the reply. I tried to make a toy example so that I could get the
same error. I have attached the data file for which the error occurs in my
program.
The code after loading this file is -

fr_cop = frankCopula(dim=6)
fit_fr_cop = fitCopula(fr_cop,pobs(data),method="mpl")

This is about looking for the degree of monetary independence between a
country and large economies. In this data, the "this" country is UK, so
that there are two columns which are exactly equal, but there are 4 other
columns which aren't. Is this a valid case?

Subject: [R] How to dynamically add variables to a dataframe
Message-ID: <CABQyo86EpoJt33VLHK2gUPVQ=6Fz=3HAaM4e_FQP-nOpAoQW_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a bit rusty with R programming and do not seem to find a solution to
add a number of variables to my existing dataframe. Basically I need to add
n=dim(d1)[1] variables to my d0 dataframe and I would like them to be named
V1, V2, V3, ... , V[dim(d1)[1])

When running the following code:

for (t in 1:dim(d1)[1]){
  d0$V[t] <- 0
}

all I get is a V variable populated with zeros...

I am sure there is a fairly straightforward code to accomplish what I need,
any suggestion?

Thank you,

Luca

Hi Luca,
How about this?

Are you missing values coded as missing values? That is, are they NA? Such NA-values should be handled by vegan::monoMDS. Naturally, it can be possible that your data set cannot be meaningfully analysed if you have too many missing values or missing values are grouped in peculiar ways. Zero-values are not missing values, but they indicate 0-difference (= identical observations). The missing values must be coded as NA.

cheers, Jari Oksanen

Hi there,

I faced a weird problem doing a seemingly simple task in R. Specifically,
when trying for reading an RDS file from the working directory, the
following error is appeared.

Code:

records <- readRDS("tweets.rds")


Error:

Error in readRDS("tweets.rds") : error reading from connection
In addition: Warning message:

Thanks,

Wouldn't the obvious problem be that your data file is corrupted or was never created  using saveRDS in the first place? Can you show us a complete example of creating and attempting to read what was just created?

Subject: [R] Gantt Chart Using Plotrix
Message-ID: <162eeb12427-c8b-9f7d@webjasstg-vab42.srv.aolmail.net>

Hi

I am trying to generate a complex Gantt chart using the gantt.chart function in the plotrix package.

Ideally I would like to use a spreadsheet to populate the activities (tasks) and start and end dates that this function expects and then export the spreadsheet file as a .CSV text file so I can read in this file to generate the gantt chart. Reading through the help file I have not been able to see what exactly this spreadsheet should like. The example provided with the "gantt.chart" function seems to indicate all the information needs to be hand coded. Because of the complexity of my chart this is not only very error prone but also is impractical. 

Can anyone help me with this? There is also a "get.gantt.info" function for creating a gantt object but the help on this is almost next to nothing !

Any help you can provide on this would be great.

There is another R package called "plan" which is very user friendly but for my purpose this doesn't have all the functionality I am looking for.

Thanks
indr

The method to generate the most interest and attention to a question is to post a reproducible example with a clear description of the desired "functionality".

Hi,

The help file for gantt.chart states that dates must be in POSIXct
format, and the example shows how to do that. There's no reason that I
can see that you can't use a data frame as input to gantt.chart, but
you need to be very careful that your data frame matches the correct
format. I bet also that your character fields were imported as
factors, because you didn't specify not to.

Try running the first couple lines of the example code, then compare

str(abc)

with

str(gantt.info)

and adjust the format of your dataset as necessary.

If you still can't figure it out, then use dput(abc) to provide a
reproducible example, and submit that to the list. We can't tell the
format of the various columns from a copy and paste.

Hi bbb_aaa,
The format for the input to the function (gantt.info) is a list. As
Sarah mentions, a data frame is a list, so as long as your columns
have the right names and are in the correct order, it should work. As
you probably know, you can import a CSV file into R as a data frame
using read.csv

Hi Sarah

Thank you very much for your pointers.

Is there a way to specify the date string as POSIXct when reading in? 

I have tried the following (very inelegant way) and still have no luck.

--- Begin Code ---

# 1st read in the spreadsheet with stringsAsFactors set to FALSE

> abc <- read.csv("gntr1.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> abc
  code tasks.labels      start        end depends done
1  101       task 1 2018-04-01 2018-04-15     101  100
2  102        task2 2018-04-15 2018-05-31     101   50
3  103       task 3 2018-06-01 2018-06-30     102    0


 # Next convert the date strings to POSIXct format:
 # The Idea here is to take each of the individual columns in the spreadsheet
 # and convert them to the required format and then assemble the dataframe back again:
 
 
> c1d1 <- abc$tasks.labels
> c1d1
[1] "task 1" "task2"  "task 3"
> c2d1 <- as.POSIXct(abc$start)
> c2d1
[1] "2018-04-01 EDT" "2018-04-15 EDT" "2018-06-01 EDT"
> c3d1 <- as.POSIXct(abc$end)
> c3d1
[1] "2018-04-15 EDT" "2018-05-31 EDT" "2018-06-30 EDT"
> cdfg <- data.frame(c1d1,c2d1,c3d1)
> cdfg
    c1d1       c2d1       c3d1
1 task 1 2018-04-01 2018-04-15
2  task2 2018-04-15 2018-05-31
3 task 3 2018-06-01 2018-06-30


# But still no luck !

> gantt.chart(cdfg)
Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, "priorities", value = numeric(0)) : 
  replacement has 0 rows, data has 3
> str(cdfg)
'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ c1d1: Factor w/ 3 levels "task 1","task 3",..: 1 3 2
 $ c2d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-01" "2018-04-15" "2018-06-01"

"task 3", "task2"), class = "factor"), c2d1 = structure(c(1522555200, 
1523764800, 1527825600), class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt"), tzone = ""), 
    c3d1 = structure(c(1523764800, 1527739200, 1530331200), class = c("POSIXct", 
    "POSIXt"), tzone = "")), .Names = c("c1d1", "c2d1", "c3d1"

Please read the Arguments and Details sections of the help page for read.csv with particular attention to the colClasses argument options.

There was a question with similar content on SO a couple of days ago. I searched for and found the rds file that was claimed to be difficult to load but had no errors when I loaded it from a copy taken from the Web. The first error indicated that the user had failed to provide the correct path/name for the file the second error (for which no code was offered) reported was that their copy was corrupt.

So this puts the onus on you to show the code that you used that was giving errors. Also need version numbers (OS, R, packages) and all the usual information outlined in the Posting Guide.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 3.5.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * All packages are by default byte-compiled on installation.  This
      makes the installed packages larger (usually marginally so) and
      may affect the format of messages and tracebacks (which often
      exclude .Call and similar).

  NEW FEATURES:

    * factor() now uses order() to sort its levels, rather than
      sort.list().  This allows factor() to support custom vector-like
      objects if methods for the appropriate generics are defined.  It
      has the side effect of making factor() succeed on empty or
      length-one non-atomic vector(-like) types (e.g., "list"), where
      it failed before.

    * diag() gets an optional names argument: this may require updates
      to packages defining S4 methods for it.

    * chooseCRANmirror() and chooseBioCmirror() no longer have a
      useHTTPS argument, not needed now all R builds support https://
      downloads.

    * New summary() method for warnings() with a (somewhat
      experimental) print() method.

    * (methods package.) .self is now automatically registered as a
      global variable when registering a reference class method.

    * tempdir(check = TRUE) recreates the tempdir() directory if it is
      no longer valid (e.g. because some other process has cleaned up
      the /tmp directory).

    * New askYesNo() function and "askYesNo" option to ask the user
      binary response questions in a customizable but consistent way.
      (Suggestion of PR#17242.)

    * New low level utilities ...elt(n) and ...length() for working
      with ... parts inside a function.

    * isTRUE() is more tolerant and now true in
      
         x <- rlnorm(99)
         isTRUE(median(x) == quantile(x)["50%"])

      New function isFALSE() defined analogously to isTRUE().

    * The default symbol table size has been increased from 4119 to
      49157; this may improve the performance of symbol resolution when
      many packages are loaded.  (Suggested by Jim Hester.)

    * line() gets a new option iter = 1.

    * Reading from connections in text mode is buffered, significantly
      improving the performance of readLines(), as well as scan() and
      read.table(), at least when specifying colClasses.

    * order() is smarter about picking a default sort method when its
      arguments are objects.

    * available.packages() has two new arguments which control if the
      values from the per-session repository cache are used (default
      true, as before) and if so how old cached values can be to be
      used (default one hour).

      These arguments can be passed from install.packages(),
      update.packages() and functions calling that: to enable this
      available.packages(), packageStatus() and download.file() gain a
      ... argument.

    * packageStatus()'s upgrade() method no longer ignores its ...
      argument but passes it to install.packages().

    * installed.packages() gains a ... argument to allow arguments
      (including noCache) to be passed from new.packages(),
      old.packages(), update.packages() and packageStatus().

    * factor(x, levels, labels) now allows duplicated labels (not
      duplicated levels!).  Hence you can map different values of x to
      the same level directly.

    * Attempting to use names<-() on an S4 derivative of a basic type
      no longer emits a warning.

    * The list method of within() gains an option keepAttrs = FALSE for
      some speed-up.

    * system() and system2() now allow the specification of a maximum
      elapsed time ('timeout').

    * debug() supports debugging of methods on any object of S4 class
      "genericFunction", including group generics.

    * Attempting to increase the length of a variable containing NULL
      using length()<- still has no effect on the target variable, but
      now triggers a warning.

    * type.convert() becomes a generic function, with additional
      methods that operate recursively over list and data.frame
      objects. Courtesy of Arni Magnusson (PR#17269).

    * lower.tri(x) and upper.tri(x) only needing dim(x) now work via
      new functions .row() and .col(), so no longer call as.matrix() by
      default in order to work efficiently for all kind of matrix-like
      objects.

    * print() methods for "xgettext" and "xngettext" now use
      encodeString() which keeps, e.g. "\n", visible.  (Wish of
      PR#17298.)

    * package.skeleton() gains an optional encoding argument.

    * approx(), spline(), splinefun() and approxfun() also work for
      long vectors.

    * deparse() and dump() are more useful for S4 objects, dput() now
      using the same internal C code instead of its previous imperfect
      workaround R code.  S4 objects now typically deparse perfectly,
      i.e., can be recreated identically from deparsed code.

      dput(), deparse() and dump() now print the names() information
      only once, using the more readable (tag = value) syntax, notably
      for list()s, i.e., including data frames.

      These functions gain a new control option "niceNames" (see
      .deparseOpts()), which when set (as by default) also uses the
      (tag = value) syntax for atomic vectors.  On the other hand,
      without deparse options "showAttributes" and "niceNames", names
      are no longer shown also for lists.  as.character(list( c (one =
      1))) now includes the name, as as.character(list(list(one = 1)))
      has always done.

      m:n now also deparses nicely when m > n.

      The "quoteExpressions" option, also part of "all", no longer
      quote()s formulas as that may not re-parse identically.
      (PR#17378)

    * If the option setWidthOnResize is set and TRUE, R run in a
      terminal using a recent readline library will set the width
      option when the terminal is resized.  Suggested by Ralf Goertz.

    * If multiple on.exit() expressions are set using add = TRUE then
      all expressions will now be run even if one signals an error.

    * mclapply() gets an option affinity.list which allows more
      efficient execution with heterogeneous processors, thanks to
      Helena Kotthaus.

    * The character methods for as.Date() and as.POSIXlt() are more
      flexible _via_ new arguments tryFormats and optional: see their
      help pages.

    * on.exit() gains an optional argument after with default TRUE.
      Using after = FALSE with add = TRUE adds an exit expression
      before any existing ones. This way the expressions are run in a
      first-in last-out fashion. (From Lionel Henry.)

    * On Windows, file.rename() internally retries the operation in
      case of error to attempt to recover from possible anti-virus
      interference.

    * Command line completion on :: now also includes lazy-loaded data.

    * If the TZ environment variable is set when date-time functions
      are first used, it is recorded as the session default and so will
      be used rather than the default deduced from the OS if TZ is
      subsequently unset.

    * There is now a [ method for class "DLLInfoList".

    * glm() and glm.fit get the same singular.ok = TRUE argument that
      lm() has had forever.  As a consequence, in glm(*, method =
      <your_own>), user specified methods need to accept a singular.ok
      argument as well.

    * aspell() gains a filter for Markdown (.md and .Rmd) files.

    * intToUtf8(multiple = FALSE) gains an argument to allow surrogate
      pairs to be interpreted.

    * The maximum number of DLLs that can be loaded into R e.g. _via_
      dyn.load() has been increased up to 614 when the OS limit on the
      number of open files allows.

    * Sys.timezone() on a Unix-alike caches the value at first use in a
      session: _inter alia_ this means that setting TZ later in the
      session affects only the _current_ time zone and not the _system_
      one.

      Sys.timezone() is now used to find the system timezone to pass to
      the code used when R is configured with --with-internal-tzcode.

    * When tar() is used with an external command which is detected to
      be GNU tar or libarchive tar (aka bsdtar), a different
      command-line is generated to circumvent line-length limits in the
      shell.

    * system(*, intern = FALSE), system2() (when not capturing output),
      file.edit() and file.show() now issue a warning when the external
      command cannot be executed.

    * The "default" ("lm" etc) methods of vcov() have gained new
      optional argument complete = TRUE which makes the vcov() methods
      more consistent with the coef() methods in the case of singular
      designs.  The former (back-compatible) behavior is given by
      vcov(*, complete = FALSE).

    * coef() methods (for lm etc) also gain a complete = TRUE optional
      argument for consistency with vcov().
      For "aov", both coef() and vcov() methods remain back-compatibly
      consistent, using the _other_ default, complete = FALSE.

    * attach(*, pos = 1) is now an error instead of a warning.

    * New function getDefaultCluster() in package parallel to get the
      default cluster set via setDefaultCluster().

    * str(x) for atomic objects x now treats both cases of is.vector(x)
      similarly, and hence much less often prints "atomic".  This is a
      slight non-back-compatible change producing typically both more
      informative and shorter output.

    * write.dcf() gets optional argument useBytes.

    * New, partly experimental packageDate() which tries to get a valid
      "Date" object from a package DESCRIPTION file, thanks to
      suggestions in PR#17324.

    * tools::resaveRdaFiles() gains a version argument, for use when
      packages should remain compatible with earlier versions of R.

    * ar.yw(x) and hence by default ar(x) now work when x has NAs,
      mostly thanks to a patch by Pavel Krivitsky in PR#17366.  The
      ar.yw.default()'s AIC computations have become more efficient by
      using determinant().

    * New warnErrList() utility (from package nlme, improved).

    * By default the (arbitrary) signs of the loadings from princomp()
      are chosen so the first element is non-negative.

    * If --default-packages is not used, then Rscript now checks the
      environment variable R_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_PACKAGES. If this is set,
      then it takes precedence over R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES. If default
      packages are not specified on the command line or by one of these
      environment variables, then Rscript now uses the same default
      packages as R. For now, the previous behavior of not including
      methods can be restored by setting the environment variable
      R_SCRIPT_LEGACY to yes.

    * When a package is found more than once, the warning from
      find.package(*, verbose=TRUE) lists all library locations.

    * POSIXt objects can now also be rounded or truncated to month or
      year.

    * stopifnot() can be used alternatively via new argument exprs
      which is nicer and useful when testing several expressions in one
      call.

    * The environment variable R_MAX_VSIZE can now be used to specify
      the maximal vector heap size. On macOS, unless specified by this
      environment variable, the maximal vector heap size is set to the
      maximum of 16GB and the available physical memory. This is to
      avoid having the R process killed when macOS over-commits memory.

    * sum(x) and sum(x1,x2,..,x<N>) with many or long logical or
      integer vectors no longer overflows (and returns NA with a
      warning), but returns double numbers in such cases.

    * Single components of "POSIXlt" objects can now be extracted and
      replaced via [ indexing with 2 indices.

    * S3 method lookup now searches the namespace registry after the
      top level environment of the calling environment.

    * Arithmetic sequences created by 1:n, seq_along, and the like now
      use compact internal representations via the ALTREP framework.
      Coercing integer and numeric vectors to character also now uses
      the ALTREP framework to defer the actual conversion until first
      use.

    * Finalizers are now run with interrupts suspended.

    * merge() gains new option no.dups and by default suffixes the
      second of two duplicated column names, thanks to a proposal by
      Scott Ritchie (and Gabe Becker).

    * scale.default(x, center, scale) now also allows center or scale
      to be "numeric-alike", i.e., such that as.numeric(.) coerces them
      correctly.  This also eliminates a wrong error message in such
      cases.

    * par*apply and par*applyLB gain an optional argument chunk.size
      which allows to specify the granularity of scheduling.

    * Some as.data.frame() methods, notably the matrix one, are now
      more careful in not accepting duplicated or NA row names, and by
      default produce unique non-NA row names.  This is based on new
      function .rowNamesDF(x, make.names = *) <- rNms where the logical
      argument make.names allows to specify _how_ invalid row names
      rNms are handled.  .rowNamesDF() is a "workaround" compatible
      default.

    * R has new serialization format (version 3) which supports custom
      serialization of ALTREP framework objects.  These objects can
      still be serialized in format 2, but less efficiently.
      Serialization format 3 also records the current native encoding
      of unflagged strings and converts them when de-serialized in R
      running under different native encoding.  Format 3 comes with new
      serialization magic numbers (RDA3, RDB3, RDX3).  Format 3 can be
      selected by version = 3 in save(), serialize() and saveRDS(), but
      format 2 remains the default for all serialization and saving of
      the workspace.  Serialized data in format 3 cannot be read by
      versions of R prior to version 3.5.0.

    * The "Date" and "date-time" classes "POSIXlt" and "POSIXct" now
      have a working `length<-` method, as wished in PR#17387.

    * optim(*, control = list(warn.1d.NelderMead = FALSE)) allows to
      turn off the warning when applying the default "Nelder-Mead"
      method to 1-dimensional problems.

    * matplot(.., panel.first = .) etc now work, as log becomes
      explicit argument and ... is passed to plot() unevaluated, as
      suggested by Sebastian Meyer in PR#17386.

    * Interrupts can be suspended while evaluating an expression using
      suspendInterrupts.  Subexpression can be evaluated with
      interrupts enabled using allowInterrupts.  These functions can be
      used to make sure cleanup handlers cannot be interrupted.

    * R 3.5.0 includes a framework that allows packages to provide
      alternate representations of basic R objects (ALTREP).  The
      framework is still experimental and may undergo changes in future
      R releases as more experience is gained. For now, documentation
      is provided in <URL:
      https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html>.

  UTILITIES:

    * install.packages() for source packages now has the possibility to
      set a 'timeout' (elapsed-time limit).  For serial installs this
      uses the timeout argument of system2(): for parallel installs it
      requires the timeout utility command from GNU coreutils.

    * It is now possible to set 'timeouts' (elapsed-time limits) for
      most parts of R CMD check _via_ environment variables documented
      in the 'R Internals' manual.

    * The 'BioC extra' repository which was dropped from Bioconductor
      3.6 and later has been removed from setRepositories().  This
      changes the mapping for 6-8 used by setRepositories(ind=).

    * R CMD check now also applies the settings of environment
      variables _R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_ and _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ to
      the re-building of vignettes.

    * R CMD check with environment variable _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ set
      to a true value makes test-suite-management packages available
      and (for the time being) works around a common omission of
      rmarkdown from the VignetteBuilder field.

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * Support for a system Java on macOS has been removed - install a
      fairly recent Oracle Java (see 'R Installation and
      Administration' SSC.3.2).

    * configure works harder to set additional flags in SAFE_FFLAGS
      only where necessary, and to use flags which have little or no
      effect on performance.

      In rare circumstances it may be necessary to override the setting
      of SAFE_FFLAGS.

    * C99 functions expm1, hypot, log1p and nearbyint are now required.

    * configure sets a -std flag for the C++ compiler for all supported
      C++ standards (e.g., -std=gnu++11 for the C++11 compiler).
      Previously this was not done in a few cases where the default
      standard passed the tests made (e.g. clang 6.0.0 for C++11).

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * 'Writing R Extensions' documents macros MAYBE_REFERENCED,
      MAYBE_SHARED and MARK_NOT_MUTABLE that should be used by package
      C code instead NAMED or SET_NAMED.

    * The object header layout has been changed to support merging the
      ALTREP branch. This requires re-installing packages that use
      compiled code.

    * 'Writing R Extensions' now documents the R_tryCatch,
      R_tryCatchError, and R_UnwindProtect functions.

    * NAMEDMAX has been raised to 3 to allow protection of intermediate
      results from (usually ill-advised) assignments in arguments to
      BUILTIN functions. Package C code using SET_NAMED may need to be
      revised.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * Sys.timezone(location = FALSE) is defunct, and is ignored (with a
      warning).

    * methods:::bind_activation() is defunct now; it typically has been
      unneeded for years.

      The undocumented 'hidden' objects .__H__.cbind and .__H__.rbind
      in package base are deprecated (in favour of cbind and rbind).

    * The declaration of pythag() in Rmath.h has been removed - the
      entry point has not been provided since R 2.14.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * printCoefmat() now also works without column names.

    * The S4 methods on Ops() for the "structure" class no longer cause
      infinite recursion when the structure is not an S4 object.

    * nlm(f, ..) for the case where f() has a "hessian" attribute now
      computes LL' = H + uI correctly.  (PR#17249).

    * An S4 method that "rematches" to its generic and overrides the
      default value of a generic formal argument to NULL no longer
      drops the argument from its formals.

    * Rscript can now accept more than one argument given on the #!
      line of a script. Previously, one could only pass a single
      argument on the #! line in Linux.

    * Connections are now written correctly with encoding "UTF-16LE".
      (PR#16737).

    * Evaluation of ..0 now signals an error.  When ..1 is used and ...
      is empty, the error message is more appropriate.

    * (Windows mainly.)  Unicode code points which require surrogate
      pairs in UTF-16 are now handled.  All systems should properly
      handle surrogate pairs, even those systems that do not need to
      make use of them.  (PR#16098)

    * stopifnot(e, e2, ...) now evaluates the expressions sequentially
      and in case of an error or warning shows the relevant expression
      instead of the full stopifnot(..)  call.

    * path.expand() on Windows now accepts paths specified as
      UTF-8-encoded character strings even if not representable in the
      current locale.  (PR#17120)

    * line(x, y) now correctly computes the medians of the left and
      right group's x-values and in all cases reproduces straight
      lines.

    * Extending S4 classes with slots corresponding to special
      attributes like dim and dimnames now works.

    * Fix for legend() when fill has multiple values the first of which
      is NA (all colours used to default to par(fg)).  (PR#17288)

    * installed.packages() did not remove the cached value for a
      library tree that had been emptied (but would not use the old
      value, just waste time checking it).

    * The documentation for installed.packages(noCache = TRUE)
      incorrectly claimed it would refresh the cache.

    * aggregate(<data.frame>) no longer uses spurious names in some
      cases.  (PR#17283)

    * object.size() now also works for long vectors.

    * packageDescription() tries harder to solve re-encoding issues,
      notably seen in some Windows locales.  This fixes the citation()
      issue in PR#17291.

    * poly(<matrix>, 3) now works, thanks to prompting by Marc
      Schwartz.

    * readLines() no longer segfaults on very large files with embedded
      '\0' (aka 'nul') characters.  (PR#17311)

    * ns() (package splines) now also works for a single observation.
      interpSpline() gives a more friendly error message when the
      number of points is less than four.

    * dist(x, method = "canberra") now uses the correct definition; the
      result may only differ when x contains values of differing signs,
      e.g. not for 0-1 data.

    * methods:::cbind() and methods:::rbind() avoid deep recursion,
      thanks to Suharto Anggono via PR#17300.

    * Arithmetic with zero-column data frames now works more
      consistently; issue raised by Bill Dunlap.

      Arithmetic with data frames gives a data frame for ^ (which
      previously gave a numeric matrix).

    * pretty(x, n) for large n or large diff(range(x)) now works better
      (though it was never meant for large n); internally it uses the
      same rounding fuzz (1e-10) as seq.default() - as it did up to
      2010-02-03 when both were 1e-7.

    * Internal C-level R_check_class_and_super() and hence
      R_check_class_etc() now also consider non-direct super classes
      and hence return a match in more cases.  This e.g., fixes
      behaviour of derived classes in package Matrix.

    * Reverted unintended change in behavior of return calls in on.exit
      expressions introduced by stack unwinding changes in R 3.3.0.

    * Attributes on symbols are now detected and prevented; attempt to
      add an attribute to a symbol results in an error.

    * fisher.test(*, workspace = <n>) now may also increase the
      internal stack size which allows larger problem to be solved,
      fixing PR#1662.

    * The methods package no longer directly copies slots (attributes)
      into a prototype that is of an "abnormal" (reference) type, like
      a symbol.

    * The methods package no longer attempts to call length<-() on NULL
      (during the bootstrap process).

    * The methods package correctly shows methods when there are
      multiple methods with the same signature for the same generic
      (still not fully supported, but at least the user can see them).

    * sys.on.exit() is now always evaluated in the right frame. (From
      Lionel Henry.)

    * seq.POSIXt(*, by = "<n> DSTdays") now should work correctly in
      all cases and is faster.  (PR#17342)

    * .C() when returning a logical vector now always maps values other
      than FALSE and NA to TRUE (as documented).

    * Subassignment with zero length vectors now coerces as documented
      (PR#17344).
      Further, x <- numeric(); x[1] <- character() now signals an error
      'replacement has length zero' (or a translation of that) instead
      of doing nothing.

    * (Package parallel.)  mclapply(), pvec() and mcparallel() (when
      mccollect() is used to collect results) no longer leave zombie
      processes behind.

    * R CMD INSTALL <pkg> now produces the intended error message when,
      e.g., the LazyData field is invalid.

    * as.matrix(dd) now works when the data frame dd contains a column
      which is a data frame or matrix, including a 0-column matrix/d.f.
      .

    * mclapply(X, mc.cores) now follows its documentation and calls
      lapply() in case mc.cores = 1 also in the case mc.preschedule is
      false.  (PR#17373)

    * aggregate(<data.frame>, drop=FALSE) no longer calls the function
      on <empty> parts but sets corresponding results to NA.  (Thanks
      to Suharto Anggono's patches in PR#17280).

    * The duplicated() method for data frames is now based on the list
      method (instead of string coercion).  Consequently unique() is
      better distinguishing data frame rows, fixing PR#17369 and
      PR#17381.  The methods for matrices and arrays are changed
      accordingly.

    * Calling names() on an S4 object derived from "environment"
      behaves (by default) like calling names() on an ordinary
      environment.

    * read.table() with a non-default separator now supports quotes
      following a non-whitespace character, matching the behavior of
      scan().

    * parLapplyLB and parSapplyLB have been fixed to do load balancing
      (dynamic scheduling).  This also means that results of
      computations depending on random number generators will now
      really be non-reproducible, as documented.

    * Indexing a list using dollar and empty string (l$"") returns
      NULL.

    * Using \usage{ data(<name>, package="<pkg>") } no longer produces
      R CMD check warnings.

    * match.arg() more carefully chooses the environment for
      constructing default choices, fixing PR#17401 as proposed by
      Duncan Murdoch.

    * Deparsing of consecutive ! calls is now consistent with deparsing
      unary - and + calls and creates code that can be reparsed
      exactly; thanks to a patch by Lionel Henry in PR#17397.  (As a
      side effect, this uses fewer parentheses in some other deparsing
      involving ! calls.)

Hi

With
> which(colSums(m4)==0)

you get column numbers with only zeroes.

You could also remove zero column by.

m4[,colSums(m4)!=0]

And with that you could find colums with ones.
which(colSums(m4)==nrow(m4))
[1] 10001
Cheers
Petr

Hi,

Your attempt didn't work because you didn't do what I suggested, which
was make sure that your data frame matched the example given in the
help for gantt.chart.

Here's what you have:
> str(cdfg)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ c1d1: Factor w/ 3 levels "task 1","task 3",..: 1 3 2
 $ c2d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-01" "2018-04-15" ...
 $ c3d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-15" "2018-05-31" ...


Here's what you should have (constructed from the example in the help file):
> str(gantt.info)
List of 4
 $ labels    : chr [1:5] "First task" "Second task" "Third task"
"Fourth task" ...
 $ starts    : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-01-01" "2004-02-02" ...
 $ ends      : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-03-03" "2004-05-05" ...
 $ priorities: num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5

You got the dates into the correct format, but the names of the list
elements (columns) do not match, and your data.frame() call turned the
labels from character into factor while you weren't looking.

gantt.chart() has no idea what you're talking about, because it is
looking for particular names.

If you fix those problems, it works fine.

colnames(cdfg) <- c("labels", "starts", "ends")
cdfg$labels <- as.character(cdfg$labels)

gantt.chart(cdfg)

Hi Sarah

Sorry for the delay in responding.

Based on your earlier message I realized that the way I was reading in the data was causing this problem. I also realized that my attempt at fixing the problem (by selecting each of the columns using the $ operator and then changing it to the appropriate format) was not helping and is very clunky.

So, I did this:

abc <- read.csv("gntr1a.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, colClasses=c("character","POSIXct","POSIXct","integer"))

and this works (I think it is important to make sure the columns in the spreadsheet are named  "starts", "ends" , etc. before exporting in order for this to work).

So, once again thank you (and also Jim and David).

Regards
Indr

Hi,

Your attempt didn't work because you didn't do what I suggested, which
was make sure that your data frame matched the example given in the
help for gantt.chart.

Here's what you have:
> str(cdfg)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ c1d1: Factor w/ 3 levels "task 1","task 3",..: 1 3 2
 $ c2d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-01" "2018-04-15" ...
 $ c3d1: POSIXct, format: "2018-04-15" "2018-05-31" ...


Here's what you should have (constructed from the example in the help file):
> str(gantt.info)
List of 4
 $ labels    : chr [1:5] "First task" "Second task" "Third task"
"Fourth task" ...
 $ starts    : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-01-01" "2004-02-02" ...
 $ ends      : POSIXct[1:5], format: "2004-03-03" "2004-05-05" ...
 $ priorities: num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5

You got the dates into the correct format, but the names of the list
elements (columns) do not match, and your data.frame() call turned the
labels from character into factor while you weren't looking.

gantt.chart() has no idea what you're talking about, because it is
looking for particular names.

If you fix those problems, it works fine.

colnames(cdfg) <- c("labels", "starts", "ends")
cdfg$labels <- as.character(cdfg$labels)

gantt.chart(cdfg)

Hi

I think the subsetting works by giving you the panels for the 
corresponding levels of the conditioning variable(s).  Note that, if 
there is more than one conditioning variable, you will need more than 
one subsetting index.

For example, taking this plot with two conditioning variables and 12 
panels in total ...

dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley)

... this produces three pages ...

dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
         layout=c(2,2))

... and this produces the second page (both panels for the first 
conditioning variable and the third and fourth panels for the second 
conditioning variable) ...

dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
         layout=c(2,2))[1:2, 3:4]

Hope that helps

Paul

Hmm.  Thanks Paul.  I may be able to work with that.  But what I really 
wanted was to take

     bar <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley)

and then do (something like)

     foo <- bar[<something>]

so that foo contains only the second page of bar, and then do print(foo)
to get a plot of (just) the second page.  Without re-issuing a 
(modified) plot command.

Is that not at all possible?

cheers,

Rolf.

Subject: [R] How to visualise what code is processed within a for loop
Message-ID: <CABQyo86wj28fFqhAUVDjhjRbCka0kc5SzwxZ_=Bpe7QdQMjfcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to debug the following code:

for (i in 1:10){
  t <- paste("d0$V",i,sep="")
  t <- ifelse(regexpr(d1[i,1],d0$X0)>0,1,0)
}

and I would like to see what code is actually processing R, how can I do
that?

More to the point, I am trying to update my variables d0$V1 to d0$V10
according to the presence or absence of some text (contained in the file
d1) within the d0$X0 variable.

The code seem to run ok, if I add print(table(t)) within the loop I can see
that the ifelse procedure is working and to some cases within the d0$V1 to
d0$V10 variable range a 1 is assigned. But when checking my d0$V1 to d0$V10
after the for loop they are all still equal to zero...

Thanks,

Luca

The loop never assigns anything to d0, only t. The first line makes t
a character string "d0$V1" (or "d0$V2" etc.). The second line assigns
either 0 or 1 to t.

Looking at this, I don't think you've got into the R psychology (bad
news if you want to use R, good news in many other ways). I assume d0
is a list, so could you put the V's into a vector, and then just use
this:

d0$V <- sapply(d1[1:10,1], grepl, d0$X0)

(I haven't checked it, but it looks,like it will do the trick. It
returns a logical vector, so if you need integers, then use an
as.numeric() around the right hand side. Or hope that R does type
conversion for you when you need it)

Message-ID: <CAKDq9_OnneCm7RKi9_GRRRdt5WQ-ia_pwd65KqOxZmmco-bOoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

How can I get text from RScript (e.g. syntax, reminder) into the result
text.
Sink() does not do that - I only read the results and therefore I have to
'guess' which syntax was used where - reminders I wrote are lost.

Bw and thank you in advance,

Roberto

Hi Bob,

Thank you for your suggestion. Actually d0 is a dataframe, does that change
something in the code you propose?

Hi Rolf

do you need to use the  layout argument?

The layout is conditioned by the levels of a or unique values if not a factor. easier with factor

unique(dta$a)
 [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l"
data.frame( a= unique(dta$a), page = rep(1:3, ea = 4), col = 1:2,row  = rep(1:2, ea = 2))
   a page col row
1  a    1   1   1
2  b    1   2   1
3  c    1   1   2
4  d    1   2   2
5  e    2   1   1
6  f    2   2   1
7  g    2   1   2
8  h    2   2   2
9  i    3   1   1
10 j    3   2   1
11 k    3   1   2
12 l    3   2   2

I hope I have got the order right

full dataset
xyplot(y~x|a,data=dta)


     bar  = xyplot(y~x|a,data = subset(dta, a %in% c("e","f","g","h")) ))

print(bar)
(missed the dotplot requirement) but principle is the same.

you can use packet.number or which.packet if needed to make it simpler

use par.settings to do colours lines etc as well as spacing.

Message-ID: <03e55b6c-742c-5247-573d-e2f33919d1d1@gmail.com>

I have a question about TukeyHSD and the glht function because I'm 
getting different answers when a covariate is included in model for 
ANCOVA.? I'm using the cabbages dataset in the 'MASS' package for 
repeatability.? If I include HeadWt as a covariate, then I get different 
answers when performing multiple comparisons using TukeyHSD and the glht 
function. The difference appears related to the predicted means used in 
the Tukey posthoc test. The glht function uses the marginal means, which 
I can obtain using the effect function in the 'effects' package.? 
TukeyHSD generates the means using the model.tables function.? Per the 
help file, "the implementation is incomplete, and only simpler cases 
have been tested thoroughly". Does this mean that TukeyHSD shouldn't be 
used when covariates are included in the model? Could anyone elaborate 
on why the model.tables function is generating means that differ from 
the effect function?? Thanks...

Hi,

I have a 'zoo' time series as below :

Zoo_TS = zoo(5:1, as.Date(Sys.time())+0:4)

Now I want to calculate First order difference of order 1, rolling
window basis i.e.

(Zoo_TS[3] - Zoo_TS[2] ) / Zoo_TS[2]
.....

Is there any direct function available to achieve this?

Thanks,

Look at the spin and stitch functions in the knitr package if you want
to process an existing script into an output that mixes the code run
with the output.

Look at the txtStart and related functions in the TeachingDemos
package if you want the code and output saved in a file from a session
where you are typing in commands.

If in general you want text, code, and output mixed, learn the knitr
and/or rmarkdown packages for how to write a file that can be
processed into a report.  Also consider learning about RStudio
notebook documents where you can have the output mixed into the
"script" file.

Subject: [R] Can't Get Lattice Histogram Minor Tick Marks to Work
Message-ID: <004a01d3dc44$9d309510$d791bf30$@matstat.com>

I'm drawing a paneled histogram using the lattice package. I've succeeded in
adding minor tick marks to the vertical axis, but I can't get the desired
number of minor tick marks between the major tick marks. 

I've attached a self-contained program to illustrate the problem.

Thanks for your help,

Thanks Jeff, 

I attached a file with the program to my earlier email because the posting guide seemed to imply that non-binary attachments would work. But I see that the file was stripped off. 

I installed the program file on a web site, but when I downloaded it, the line breaks were stripped out. So I've included the program below:

-------------------------------------------------------

# This R program illustrates a problem with the histogram function in 
# the lattice package.
# This program requires the  latticeExtra  package to be installed to
# generate the minor tickmarks.

library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)  

# First, please run the program to see the problem.

# Note how the histogram shows minor tickmarks on the vertical axis. 
# I would like to show only a SINGLE minor tickmark between major tickmarks on
# the vertical axis, which helps to show the viewer that all the bars
# in the left panel are at five percent.

# The yscale.components.subticks function in the latticeExtras package
# has arguments to contol the minor tickmarks, but I can't get them to work.
# How can a get a single minor tickmark between the major tickmarks on
# the vertical axis?

# Thanks for your help,

# Generate data in an 20 x 2 matrix for left panel. In my real application

for (i in 1:20) {
    if (i == 1) {pmat = c(0.045,0)} else {
                 pmat = rbind(pmat,c(i*0.05-0.001,0))}
                }

# Generate data for the right panel in the same matrix.
counts = c(90, 12.5, 9, 8, 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 
           4, 3.5, 3, 2.8, 2.2, 2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.0)
for (i in 1:20) {
    maxCount = 100 * counts[i]
    for (j in 1:maxCount){
    pmat = rbind( pmat, c(i*0.05-0.001,2) )
                         }
                }

# Convert the matrix to a data frame and add column names.
pDat = data.frame(pmat)
colnames(pDat) = c("pValue","nonCent")


# Create a factor to enable titles on the two panels.
nonCent.f = factor(pDat$nonCent, 
  labels=c("Noncentrality = 0.0", "Noncentrality = 2.0"))

# Use the lattice histogram function to draw the histogram.
histogram( ~ pValue | nonCent.f, data = pDat, nint = 20,
   endpoints = c(0, 1), layout = c(2,1), 
   yscale.components=yscale.components.subticks,
   scales=list(alternating=FALSE,tck=c(1,0)),
   col="lightgray")

Hi

You may need to make a custom function for yscale.components; I think there
is an example in the help guides
Also have a look at
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-June/134524.html

Subject: [R] Fitting survival trees with competing risk
Message-ID: <000001d3dc71$4df76370$e9e62a50$@unina.it>

Dear all,

 

I'm interested in fitting survival trees with competing risk analysis.

The tree should show the cumulative incidence function for each terminal
node .

 

I read several paper illustrating this possibility, but to the best of my
knowledge no R code are reported.

 

There is any R package for this fit?

 

Thank you very much in advance.

Thanks Jeff, 

I attached a file with the program to my earlier email because the posting guide seemed to imply that non-binary attachments would work. But I see that the file was stripped off. 

Restating the problem:

I'm drawing a paneled histogram using the lattice package. I've succeeded in adding minor tick marks to the vertical axis, but I can't get the desired number of minor tick marks between the major tick marks.

I installed the program file on a web site, but when I downloaded it, the line breaks were stripped out. So I've included the program below:

-------------------------------------------------------

# This R program illustrates a problem with the histogram function in # the lattice package.
# This program requires the  latticeExtra  package to be installed to # generate the minor tickmarks.

library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)  

# First, please run the program to see the problem.

# Note how the histogram shows minor tickmarks on the vertical axis. 
# I would like to show only a SINGLE minor tickmark between major tickmarks on # the vertical axis, which helps to show the viewer that all the bars # in the left panel are at five percent.

# The yscale.components.subticks function in the latticeExtras package # has arguments to contol the minor tickmarks, but I can't get them to work.
# How can a get a single minor tickmark between the major tickmarks on # the vertical axis?

# Thanks for your help,

# Don Macnaughton donmac at matstat.com


# Generate data in an 20 x 2 matrix for left panel. In my real application # the data file contains many more rows, but that's not necessary here.
for (i in 1:20) {
    if (i == 1) {pmat = c(0.045,0)} else {
                 pmat = rbind(pmat,c(i*0.05-0.001,0))}
                }

# Generate data for the right panel in the same matrix.
counts = c(90, 12.5, 9, 8, 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 
           4, 3.5, 3, 2.8, 2.2, 2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.0) for (i in 1:20) {
    maxCount = 100 * counts[i]
    for (j in 1:maxCount){
    pmat = rbind( pmat, c(i*0.05-0.001,2) )
                         }
                }

# Convert the matrix to a data frame and add column names.
pDat = data.frame(pmat)
colnames(pDat) = c("pValue","nonCent")


# Create a factor to enable titles on the two panels.
nonCent.f = factor(pDat$nonCent,
  labels=c("Noncentrality = 0.0", "Noncentrality = 2.0"))

# Use the lattice histogram function to draw the histogram.

Subject: [R] How to visualise what code is processed within a for loop
In-Reply-To: <CABQyo86wj28fFqhAUVDjhjRbCka0kc5SzwxZ_=Bpe7QdQMjfcw@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CABQyo86wj28fFqhAUVDjhjRbCka0kc5SzwxZ_=Bpe7QdQMjfcw@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <3CC68751-D5D8-4C69-89F6-4559D8A076B4@llnl.gov>

Your code doesn't make sense to me in a couple of ways.

Inside the loop, the first line assigns a value to an object named "t".
Then, the second line does the same thing, assigns a value to an object named "t".

The value of the object named "t" after the second line will be the output of the ifelse() expression, whatever that is. This has the effect of making the first line irrelevant. Whatever value t has after the first line is replaced by whatever it gets from the second line.

It looks like the first line inside the loop is constructing the name of a data frame column, and storing that name as a character string. However, the second line doesn't use that name at all. If your goal is to update the contents of a column, you need to assign something to that column in the next line. Instead you assign it to the object named "t".

What you're looking for will be more along the lines of this:

    for (i in 1:10){
      nm <- paste0("V", i)
      d0[[nm]] <- ifelse( regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0, 1, 0)
    }

This may not a complete solution, since I have no idea what the contents or structure of d1 are, or what the regexpr() is expected to return.

And notice the use of double brackets, [[ and ]]. This is one way to reference a column of a  data frame when you have the column's name stored in a variable. Another way is d0[ , nm]


A couple of additional comments:

 "t" is a poor choice of object name, because it is one of R's built-in functions (immediately after starting a fresh session of R, with nothing left over from any previous session, type help("r") and see what you get).

 ifelse() is intended for use on vectors, not scalars, and it looks like maybe you're using it on a scalar (can't be sure about this, though)

For example, ifelse() is designed for this kind of usage:
> ifelse( c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) , 1:3, 11:13)
[1]  1 12  3

Although it works ok for these
> ifelse(TRUE, 3, 4)
[1] 3
> ifelse(FALSE, 3, 4)
[1] 4
They are not really what it is intended for.

      t <- ifelse(regexpr(d1[i,1],d0$X0)>0,1,0)

    More to the point, I am trying to update my variables d0$V1 to d0$V10
    according to the presence or absence of some text (contained in the file
    d1) within the d0$X0 variable.
    
    The code seem to run ok, if I add print(table(t)) within the loop I can see
    that the ifelse procedure is working and to some cases within the d0$V1 to
    d0$V10 variable range a 1 is assigned. But when checking my d0$V1 to d0$V10
    after the for loop they are all still equal to zero...

Subject: [R] Package 'data.table' in version R-3.5.0 not successfully being
 installed
Message-ID: <CACLgfx333+FT9HYn2LbzaTBGhaCYQkaoM_5XRK3kQMg3E7N4Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir,

I am using R on Windows OS platform. I upgraded my R-system to version
R-3.5.0. While upgrading my libraries in R as well as in RStudio, I am
stuck up in the package 'data.table', which is required by many other
packages in R-codes in my R-Markdown files.

I tried to install 'data.table' from "USA-berkely" and "UK-bristol"  as
well as "RStudio" mirrors when the following errors are being shown:

From  USA-berkely and UK-bristol mirrors:
=================================
Package which is only available in source form, and may need
  compilation of C/C++/Fortran: ?data.table?
  These will not be installed
Warning message:

  InternetOpenUrl failed: ''

From RStudio mirror:
================
Package which is only available in source form, and may need compilation of
  C/C++/Fortran: ?data.table?
  These will not be installed

Afterwards, I consulted google users, I downloaded the source package:
"data.table_1.10.4-3.tar.gz" from CRAN, stored it on desktop, and tried
following command for installing from source only:


install.packages("C:\\Users\\Dr. A.K.
Singh\\Desktop\\data.table_1.10.4-3.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

This generated following errors messages:

I build binary data files into a library by placing the .rda files at the proper \data sub-folder before building the library with the following procedure:
1. File -> Open project
2. Build -> Build binary packages.
This has worked up to 3 .rda files.

Now, I add another .rda file to the folder. I received a very strange, seemingly unrelated warning message that says:

Warning: object '.Random.seed' is created by more than one data call

The weird thing about this is, repeating the procedure, I sometime can access the data file from the library (i.e., by data(filename)), other time I cannot access the data file. The data file is big but not so big (571 KB).

Any clues? Why am I getting that warning message?

Message-ID: <CAFAkCyWsPn0wCJ8kqMTJpoFxLQ77RvBFZ9DqQESF+kCBX0U36w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
apologies if this is basic: I am writing a function:

fb<-function(mean, median, mode, a, b=0.95, lower=F)
{....}

The arguments mean, median and mode are mutually exclusive (i.e. the user
should define only one of these). How do I code this within the function?

Thanks,
Pol

Hi Pol,
Here is one way:

fb <- function(mean=NULL, median=NULL, mode=NULL, a, b=0.95, lower=F) {

    stopifnot ( (is.null(mean) + is.null(median) + is.null(mode)) == 2 )

    etc...

}

Dear A.K. Singh,

As you discovered, the data.table package has an error under R 3.5.0 that prevents CRAN from distributing a Windows binary for the package. The reason that you weren't able to install the package from source is apparently that you haven't installed the R package-building tools for Windows. See <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

Because a number of users of my Rcmdr and car packages have contacted me with a similar issue, as a temporary work-around I've placed a Windows binary for the data.table package on my website at <https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/.Pickup/data.table_1.10.4-3.zip>. You should be able to install the package from there via the command

	install.packages("https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/.Pickup/data.table_1.10.4-3.zip", repos=NULL, type="win.binary")

I expect that this problem will go away when the maintainer of the data.table package fixes the error.

I hope this helps,
 John

You can see the errors in the package on this web page:

https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_data.table.html

Currently it is failing self-tests on all platforms except r-oldrel, 
which is the previous release of R.  I'd recommend backing out of R 
3.5.0 and going to R 3.4.4 if that's a possibility for you.

Yet another possibility is to use a version of data.table from Github, 
which is newer than the version on CRAN and may have fixed the errors, 
but that would require an installation from source, which not every 
Windows user is comfortable with.

Dear Duncan,

I think that your advice to downgrade may make sense if A. K. Singh actually needs to use data.table. In the case of the car package, for example, which depends on data.table indirectly via the rio package, data.table never gets used. As well, the examples and vignettes in data.table appear to work under R 2.5.0, so it's possible that (much of) the functionality of the package is intact.

Best,
 John

Here is some unsolicited advice:  I would strongly recommend that you 
make it a higher priority to have backups available.  In my experience 
computer hardware is becoming quite reliable, but software isn't, and 
the person next to the keyboard isn't either.  (My last desperate need 
for a backup was due to a hardware failure 2 years ago, but it wasn't 
the manufacturer's fault:  my laptop accidentally drowned.)

Backups can save you a lot of grief in the event of a mistake, or a 
software or hardware failure.  But even in the case of routine events 
like software updates that don't go as planned, they can save time.

I'm guessing you don't have the proper Rtools installation for 3.5:

You can see the errors in the package on this web page:

https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_data.table.html

Currently it is failing self-tests on all platforms except r-oldrel,
which is the previous release of R.  I'd recommend backing out of R
3.5.0 and going to R 3.4.4 if that's a possibility for you.

Yet another possibility is to use a version of data.table from Github,
which is newer than the version on CRAN and may have fixed the errors,
but that would require an installation from source, which not every
Windows user is comfortable with.

You are right. I do take backups. But, this time I was too sure that
nothing will go wrong. But, this was over-confidence. I need to take more
care in future. Thanks anyway.

If you're installing packages to the default location in your home
account and you didn't remove those library folders, you still have
you R 3.4 package installs there, e.g.

> dir(dirname(.libPaths()[1]), full.names = TRUE)
[1] "/home/hb/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4"
[2] "/home/hb/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5"
[3] "/home/hb/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6"

Hello,

I downloaded your .rar-file and looked through your R-code. You should 
revise your script. Specifically, start by looking at what data set you 
are referring to when training your knn-model: you never create the object 
"modeldata".

Best of luck.

Hi

Does this not do what you want ... ?

allpages <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
                     layout=c(2,2))
page2 <- allpages[1:2, 3:4]
print(page2)

Hmm, looks like that thread has more noise than signal...

AFAICT, data.table currently fails selftests i 3.5.0 on all platforms on the CRAN builders, so RTools issues are only incidental and it would be better to fix data.table in the sources. 

From the looks of it, I wouldn't be surprised if the root cause is the changes to POSIXlt methods in 3.5.0, but I haven't actually been digging in to check that.

Yes. Using Rtools to install the package from source or installing the binary I provided is just a band-aid that allows packages with dependencies on data.table (direct or indirect) to load.

Dear Akhilesh,

I hope that it's clear that the Windows binary I provided for the data.table package is a temporary solution, and that the maintainer should fix the package so that it passes its own tests. You should be careful using the package in its current state.

Best,
 John

Akhilesh,

I don't know if I am adding signal or noise here, but I installed R 3.5.0 yesterday and installed data.table just fine, but I have Rtools installed.  "Building packages from source" may sound intimidating, but Rtools is really easy to install and once installed, it does all the work for you.

Thanks,

Roger

Subject: [R] about combining analysis results using package 'flexmix' and '
 mice'
Message-ID: <CAN_1JwRxx+7+DiE7HYjf0NV9Oqnfbb89=7U1mD6+9LW4Ms1j+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently using package ?mice? to do multiple imputation for tourist
data here. Then the  complete datasets (e.g. m>= 100)  will be analyzed
with a finite mixture model using package ?flexmix?. I have found that it
seems no feasible way to combine the multiple results into a final one
smoothly using just a few commands. By the way I have seen that package
like ?semTools? has such function to combine the ?within variance? and ?
between variance? for the estimated parameters, but it applies for SEM
models only. Do you have some recommendations about the combinations of
results after ?mice? and ? flexmix? packages if available? Thank you very
much.


Sincerely

Subject: [R] Package ddalpha is not building for me in R 3.5.0
Message-ID: <5bb06967-4ed5-e90e-6d5b-168f3d5fe421@utoronto.ca>

I was updating packages after upgrading R to 3.5.0 and one package, 
ddalpha, that is dependency for caret is not building. All the compiled 
code builds but something seems to start going wrong at the byte-compile 
stage. Here is the error and sessionInfo(). My computer has 8 GB of RAM, 
by the way. Has anyone else encountered this?

I agree, subject to a couple of caveats.

1.  There are apparently instructions online that somehow mess up the 
installation of Rtools, putting it in a location that doesn't work 
without other changes that aren't described.  If people just run the 
installer and accept the defaults, it works.  Don't trust bloggers, 
trust CRAN.

2.  data.table fails its self-tests in 3.5.0, as shown on CRAN. 
Apparently fixes are in the works, but being able to install it doesn't 
mean it will work properly.

Hi Paul, Rolf

I do not know how legal this is but this works if you have spaces around the ultimate plot due to changes in layout
Changing the layout parameters removes the unwanted space.

ap = dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,layout = c(2,6))
apm = ap[1:2,3:4]
apm$layout <- c(2,2)
apm

Hi

Does this not do what you want ... ?

allpages <- dotplot(variety ~ yield | year * site, data=barley,
                     layout=c(2,2))
page2 <- allpages[1:2, 3:4]

Thanks Don,

    for (i in 1:10){
      nm <- paste0("V", i)
      d0[[nm]] <- ifelse( regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0, 1, 0)
    }

is exaclty what I needed.

Hello,

instead of ifelse, the following is exactly the same and much more 
efficient.

d0[[nm]] <- as.integer(regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0)


Hope this helps,

I forgot to explain why my suggestion.

The logical condition returns FALSE/TRUE that in R are coded as 0/1.
So all you have to do is coerce to integer.

This works because the ifelse will return a 1 or a 0 depending on the 
condition. Meaning exactly the same values. And is more efficient since 
ifelse creates both vectors, the true part and the false part, and then 
indexes those vectors in order to return the appropriate values. This is 
the double of the trouble and a great deal of memory used.

Subject: [R] Compare global and between group variability of 2 mixed effect
 models
Message-ID: <CALcwahOUiutiQNXPz-okHTBn-fxKbSH-HF=A4b3Z9Pa+NYpTZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We are comparing some features of our product against a competitor. Since
the product is produced in lots and we have proof that ambient temperature
is relevant for its functioning we used a mixed effect model (MEM)
structured this way (NB: R lme4 notation):

`out ~ Brand * Temperature + (Temperature | Lot)`

with out being the various outcomes, a random intercept on Lot and a random
slope on Temperature.

We need to understand which brand has more variability between single items
and between lots.

We thought of using the random intercept and residual standard deviations
from the MEM for each brand. The problem now is how to compare them.

We tried using the F distribution to build confidence intervals and
hypothesis test, but for most of the outcomes we evaluated, one or both
models had zero standard deviation on the random intercept, so it's
impossible to take the ratio (lots of zeros, infinity, NaN).

We investigated also the variance gamma distribution, that can describe the
difference of two standard deviations (so zeros are not a problem), but we
don't actually know how to pass the right parameters to describe our data.

As a third alternative, we tried modeling the ratio between standard
deviations with a bayes-regularized glm model with Poisson links:

`bayesglm(c(sd1, sd2) ~ c('mod1', 'mod2), weights = c(n1, n2), family =
poisson())

But we are not sure whether it could be a meaningful approximation or not.
We thought of a Poisson distribution because it can natively cope with
zeros and the bayes regularization to avoid too extreme estimates (eg: 0 -
Inf confidence intervals).

Finally, we thought of a much simpler approach:
- first use a Levene test to compare raw variances between brands.
- than using ANOVA to test for between-lots variability for each brand.

Although much simpler, this methodology don?t use the information on the
clustered structure of the data and the effect of temperature. Furthermore,
it doesn't formally compare between-lots variability between brands, it
just produce two F scores.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAMLwc7NP++Fq4bPHSN4iR2Ei_7wB0ojT0KjDfgryOKUuxM3OCA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to make a similar plot -
https://peltiertech.com/images/2013-09/BarLineSampleChart4.png.

I have data for two variables; count and z by city and week. I would like
to have a horizontal bar plot of *count* by city and a line plot of weekly
average of the variable *z*.

I have tried the following:

ggplot() + geom_bar(data=dat, aes(x=city, y=count),
stat="identity",position="dodge") + coord_flip() +
geom_line(data=dat, aes(x=week, y=mean_tmin))

However, this flips the code for both the bar plot and the line plot. I
would the y-axis of the line plot to be on the left-vertical axis. I read
that it is difficult to have a secondary axis with ggplot. Any help will be
highly appreciated. Thank you!

Hi Miluji,
You have a problem as the x-axis is different for the two plots.
However, the y-axis can be the same, so you really don't need
different axes. I think you want to display city within week. The
example below shows how to display both the counts for the cities by
week, the mean z by week and then use legends to identify the
different parts of the plot. I'm afraid that I didn't even try to do
this in ggplot.

# this uses your structure "dat"
weekcity<-dat[order(dat$week,dat$city),1:4]
barpos<-barplot(matrix(weekcity$count,nrow=5),names.arg=1:3,
 legend.text=c("Akron","Boston","Houston","NYC","OKC"),
 args.legend=list(x=8,y=6),xlab="count",
 ylab="Week",beside=TRUE,horiz=TRUE)
lines(by(weekcity$z,weekcity$week,mean),colMeans(barpos),
 type="b",lwd=2)
legend(5.5,16,"Weekly mean of z",pch=1,lty=1,lwd=2)

Hi Miluji,

Using Jim's interpretation of your desired graph,
you could do it in ggplot2 using your dat DF by:

ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data=dat,
    aes(x=week,y=count,fill=city),stat="identity",position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_line(data=dat, aes(x=week, y=mean_tmin))

There would still need some work to be done to get the weekly mean
into a legend, but it is achievable if required.

Ron.

Hi Rui

Thank you for your suggestion,

I have tested the code suggested by you against that supplied by Don in
terms of timing and results are very much aligned: to populate a 5954x899
0/1 matrix on my machine your procedure took 79 secs, while the one with
ifelse employed 80 secs, hence unfortunately not really any significant
time saved there.

Nevertheless thank you for your contribution.

Kind regards,

Luca

Luca,

If speed is important, you might improve performance by making d0 into a true matrix, rather than a data frame (assuming d0 is indeed a data frame at this point). Although data frames may look like matrices, they aren?t, and they have some overhead that matrices don?t.  I don?t think you would be able to use the [[nm]] syntax with a matrix, but [ , nm] should work, provided the matrix has column names. Or you could perhaps index by column number.

I had a project some years ago in which I reduced calculation time a lot by extracting the numeric columns of a data frame and working with them, then recombining them with the character columns. R?s performance working with data frames has improved since then, so I really don?t know if it would make a difference for your task.

I forgot to explain why my suggestion.

The logical condition returns FALSE/TRUE that in R are coded as 0/1.
So all you have to do is coerce to integer.

This works because the ifelse will return a 1 or a 0 depending on the condition. Meaning exactly the same values. And is more efficient since ifelse creates both vectors, the true part and the false part, and then indexes those vectors in order to return the appropriate values. This is the double of the trouble and a great deal of memory used.

Your code doesn't make sense to me in a couple of ways.

Inside the loop, the first line assigns a value to an object named "t".
Then, the second line does the same thing, assigns a value to an object
named "t".

The value of the object named "t" after the second line will be the output
of the ifelse() expression, whatever that is. This has the effect of making
the first line irrelevant. Whatever value t has after the first line is
replaced by whatever it gets from the second line.

It looks like the first line inside the loop is constructing the name of a
data frame column, and storing that name as a character string. However,
the second line doesn't use that name at all. If your goal is to update the
contents of a column, you need to assign something to that column in the
next line. Instead you assign it to the object named "t".

What you're looking for will be more along the lines of this:

     for (i in 1:10){
       nm <- paste0("V", i)
       d0[[nm]] <- ifelse( regexpr(d1[i,1], d0$X0) > 0, 1, 0)
     }

This may not a complete solution, since I have no idea what the contents
or structure of d1 are, or what the regexpr() is expected to return.

And notice the use of double brackets, [[ and ]]. This is one way to
reference a column of a  data frame when you have the column's name stored
in a variable. Another way is d0[ , nm]


A couple of additional comments:

  "t" is a poor choice of object name, because it is one of R's built-in
functions (immediately after starting a fresh session of R, with nothing
left over from any previous session, type help("r") and see what you get).

  ifelse() is intended for use on vectors, not scalars, and it looks like
maybe you're using it on a scalar (can't be sure about this, though)

For example, ifelse() is designed for this kind of usage:
ifelse( c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) , 1:3, 11:13)
[1]  1 12  3

Although it works ok for these
ifelse(TRUE, 3, 4)
[1] 3
ifelse(FALSE, 3, 4)
[1] 4
They are not really what it is intended for.

Hello,

Another thing to note is that regexpr is likely to take (much) more time 
than ifelse or as.integer.
And the code will therefore not be very optimizable.

Thank you for both replies Don & Rui,

The very issue here is that there is a search that needs to be done within
a text field and I agree with Rui later comment that regexpr might indeed
be the time consuming piece of code.

I might try to optimise this piece of code later on, but for the time being
I am working on the following part of building a neural network to try
indeed classifying some text.

Again, thanks,

Luca

"I am working on the following part of building a neural network to try
indeed classifying some text."

... and so you are most likely trying to reinvent wheels. There are
already many such tools available here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html

Some of these are interfaces to C language code, and so are probably
much more efficient than anything you (or I) can do at the R level.

Of course, if this is mainly a programming exercise for you, than this
is largely irrelevant.

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] R 3.5 and RTools
Message-ID: <CAMM2pDo69mL2=w4GwWe=k7xHpHKwffMwLQuP90Uk+3ufxqOqVw@mail.gmail.com>

Is Rtools 3.4 or 3.5 the recommended version for to go along with R 3.5.0?

The reason I ask is our corporate IT upgraded our systems to R 3.5.0
but does not *want* to upgrade Rtools to 3.5 since it is not "frozen".
>From the RTools download page this seems like it should work but I 'd
like to confirm.

Thanks in advance,

Brian
