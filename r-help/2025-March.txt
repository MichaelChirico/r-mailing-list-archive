Subject: [R] expression in lattice panel strip
Message-ID: <IA1P223MB04997BF88B4F3ECDFB5FA8ECFACE2@IA1P223MB0499.NAMP223.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Is it possible to include expression in lattice panel strip?
Thanks,
Naresh

cs <- 2 * cos(2 * pi * (1:500) / 50 + 0.6 * pi)
w <- rnorm(500)
xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)), screens = list(x1 = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)), x2 = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi) + N(0, 1))), type = c("l", "g"), main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)))

# Greek letter pi is shown in main title, but not in panel strips

Full disclosure: I have never plotted time series using this xyplot method.

However, ?xyplot.ts says:

"screens

factor (or coerced to factor) whose levels specify which panel each
series is to be plotted in. screens = c(1, 2, 1) would plot series 1,
2 and 3 in panels 1, 2 and 1. May also be a named list, see Details
below."

>From that I would infer the answer to your query in no: factors, know
nothing about plotmath notation, and as.factor() just coerces your
expressions to character strings that are the factor labels.
strip.default() then uses these character strings as the labels for
the strips, giving what you got.

As you only want to use a "pi" character, ?, in your math expression,
I tried using a UTF-8 symbol for it, \U1D6D1, in quoted strings as the
argument for the screens parameter. That is:

striplabs <- factor(c("2cos(2\U1D6D1t/50 + 0.6\U1D6D1)",
                      "2cos(2\U1D6D1t /50 + 0.6\U1D6D1) + N(0, 1)"))
xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)),
       type = c("l", "g"),
       main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)),
       screens = striplabs
)

The RStudio graphics device was *not* able to interpret the UTF-8 in
the strip, but on my Mac, the Cairo_pdf() device (or just using the
export button to export the graphic as a pdf from RStudio) *did*
reproduce the characters nicely in the strip labels in the pdf.
Unfortunately, the main title expression symbol for pi (presumably
from the adobe font symbols) did not look nice. However, using the
quoted graphics string (the first level of the striplabs factor) does
fine, of course.

As I just sort of barely know what I'm doing here, there may be a much
better way to do this by using an appropriate font specification in a
strip = strip.custom(par.strip.text= ...) argument to xyplot, but that
exceeds my current abilities. Maybe you or one of the R cognescenti
can figure it  out.

Again, please note my full disclosure.

Cheers,
Bert

This is possible but a little cumbersome. Bert is on the right track with
strip.custom:

xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)),
       strip = strip.custom(factor.levels =
                                expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 *
pi),
                                           2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 *
pi) + N(0, 1))),
       type = c("l", "g"),
       main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)))

where (from the docs):

factor.levels: vector of character strings or expressions giving the
          levels of the conditioning variable currently being drawn.
          For more than one conditioning variable, this will vary with
          'which.given'.

This is relatively straightforward with only one conditioning variable. A
more general solution for multiple conditioning variables would be

estrip <- function(..., factor.levels)
{
    strip.default(..., factor.levels = parse(text = factor.levels))
}

xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)),
       screens = list(x1 = "2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)",
                      x2 = "2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi) + N(0, 1)"),
       strip = estrip,
       type = c("l", "g"),
       main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)))

Hi,

I have below data

dat2 = c("-24.437285333333300", "4.850695000000000", "-1.918495666666670",

"?-9.881474000000000")

Now when I try to convert this data to numeric, I got NA as below

> as.numeric(dat2)

 [7]   4.1932877   0.3782577   4.6589550          NA

Could you please help to understand why I get NA for the last value?

There's an invisible Unicode character in there, U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH
NO-BREAK SPACE:

1: <ef><bb><bf>-9.881474000000000

Try as.numeric(gsub('\ufeff', '', dat2)).

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for your solution.

Is there any way to remove all possible "Unicode character" that may
be present in the array at once?

Define a range of characters you consider acceptable, and you'll be
able to use regular expressions to remove everything else. For example,
the following expression should remove everything except ASCII digits,
dots, and hyphen-minus:

gsub('[^0-9.-]+', '', dat2)

There is a brief introduction to regular expressions in ?regex and
various online resources such as <https://regex101.com/>.

          'which.given'.

This is relatively straightforward with only one conditioning variable. A more general solution for multiple conditioning variables would be

estrip <- function(..., factor.levels)
{
    strip.default(..., factor.levels = parse(text = factor.levels))
}

xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)),
       screens = list(x1 = "2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)",
                      x2 = "2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi) + N(0, 1)"),
       strip = estrip,
       type = c("l", "g"),
       main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)))

Full disclosure: I have never plotted time series using this xyplot method.

However, ?xyplot.ts says:

"screens

factor (or coerced to factor) whose levels specify which panel each
series is to be plotted in. screens = c(1, 2, 1) would plot series 1,
2 and 3 in panels 1, 2 and 1. May also be a named list, see Details
below."

From that I would infer the answer to your query in no: factors, know
nothing about plotmath notation, and as.factor() just coerces your
expressions to character strings that are the factor labels.
strip.default() then uses these character strings as the labels for
the strips, giving what you got.

As you only want to use a "pi" character, ?, in your math expression,
I tried using a UTF-8 symbol for it, \U1D6D1, in quoted strings as the
argument for the screens parameter. That is:

striplabs <- factor(c("2cos(2\U1D6D1t/50 + 0.6\U1D6D1)",
                      "2cos(2\U1D6D1t /50 + 0.6\U1D6D1) + N(0, 1)"))
xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)),
       type = c("l", "g"),
       main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)),
       screens = striplabs
)

The RStudio graphics device was *not* able to interpret the UTF-8 in
the strip, but on my Mac, the Cairo_pdf() device (or just using the
export button to export the graphic as a pdf from RStudio) *did*
reproduce the characters nicely in the strip labels in the pdf.
Unfortunately, the main title expression symbol for pi (presumably
from the adobe font symbols) did not look nice. However, using the
quoted graphics string (the first level of the striplabs factor) does
fine, of course.

As I just sort of barely know what I'm doing here, there may be a much
better way to do this by using an appropriate font specification in a
strip = strip.custom(par.strip.text= ...) argument to xyplot, but that
exceeds my current abilities. Maybe you or one of the R cognescenti
can figure it  out.

Again, please note my full disclosure.

Cheers,
Bert

The second solution Ivan offers looks good, and a bit more general than his first that simply removes one non-visible character.

It begs the question of why the data has that anomaly at all. Did the data come from a text-processing environment where it was going to wrap there and was protected?

As Ivan points out, there is a question of what format you expect numbers in and what "as.numeric"  should do when it does not see an integer or floating point number. 

If you test it, you can see that as.numeric ignores leading and/or trailing blanks and tabs and even newlines sometimes and some other irrelevant ASCII characters. In that spirit, the UNICODE character being mentioned should be one that any UNICODE-aware version of as.numeric should ignore.

But UNICODE supports a much wider vision of numeric so that there are numeric-equivalent symbols in other languages and groupings and even something like the symbols for numerals in light or dark circles count as numbers. Those can likely safely be excluded in this context but perhaps not in a more general function.

But I note as.numeric seems to handle scientific notation as in:

as.numeric("1.23e8")
[1] 1.23e+08

So a single instance of the letters "e" and "E" must be supported if your numbers in string form may contain them. Further, the E cannot be the first or last letter. It cannot have adjacent whitespace. Still, if you are OK with getting an NA in such situations, it should be OK.

It gets worse. Hexadecimal is supported:

> as.numeric("0X12")
[1] 18

You now need to support the letters x and X. But only if preceded by a zero! 

It gets still worse as any characters from [0-9A-F] are supported:

> as.numeric("0xAE")
[1] 174

There may be other scenarios it handles. The filter applied might remove valid numbers so you may want to carefully document it if your program only handles a restricted set.

A possible idea might be to make two passes and only  evaluate any resulting NA from as.numeric() by doing a substitution like Ivan suggests to try to fix any broken ones. But note it may fix too much as "1.2 e 5" might become "1.2e5" as spaces are removed.

Define a range of characters you consider acceptable, and you'll be
able to use regular expressions to remove everything else. For example,
the following expression should remove everything except ASCII digits,
dots, and hyphen-minus:

gsub('[^0-9.-]+', '', dat2)

There is a brief introduction to regular expressions in ?regex and
various online resources such as <https://regex101.com/>.

The zero-width no-break space character is used as the Byte Order
Mark.  That is, an official function for it at the beginning of a
character sequence
is to indicate whether you have 2-byte or 4-byte big-endian or
little-endian encoding.  It was not intended for use in UTF-8, where
there is nothing for
it to tell you, but Microsoft jumped in with all six feet and said
"hey, we'll use this to indicate that it's Unicode in UTF-8 and not
one of the hundreds
of other 8-bit coded character sets."  I've lost count of the number
of programs that have choked because they were given a BOM where they
didn't expect one.

So there is no great mystery about why there is a BOM at the beginning
of this particular string.
The real mystery is why it was there and NOT at the beginning of all the others.

I suggest that it is a good idea to remove the BOM character from the
beginning of microsofted strings,
but a bad idea to remove any other character.  If you are given bad
data like "Bond-007" when you
expect a number, you want to know about it, and not mistake it for
-007.  Still less do you want a
phone number like "+61 3 555 1234 x77" to be mistaken for a plain
number "613555123477".

This is not for the R inferno.
This is for the Microsoft interno, or perhaps the Unicode inferno.
The Byte Order Mark is supposed to appear at the beginning of UTF-32
or UTF-16 *external* data, like a file
or data coming over a socket.
In the Microsoft world, it also tends to appear at the beginning of
UTF-8 files, where strictly speaking, it shouldn't.
ONLY at the beginning does ZWNBSP have this function.

I use a lot of programming languages, and I don't know any that
routinely ignores ZWNBSP.


Hmm.  I wonder if the strings in this example are fields of a data
file but were originally in a different
order, with the last string first?

What *would* make sense would be an option, when opening a connection,
to skip a leading BOM.

I like your examples, Richard, of strings that should not be considered as numbers. There are times you want to recognize something like "221B Baker Street" and extract the 221 or perhaps the 221B as a part of a full address and ignore the rest. But one goal of a function like as.numeric() is to handle fully-formed numbers ready to be converted to another storage format. 

People with special uses and needs generally need to roll their own. A Bank may want to be able to handle this:

as.currency("five hundred twenty eight dollars and thirty two cents")

And someone else may want to handle Roman numerals, or calculate the value of text in a form of numerology like:
gematria("???") generates 18.

But what you describe with ?soft is quite inconsiderate and I wonder if it should be automatically handled by an enhanced version of the as.numeric family. There is indeed a general problem with different character sets and how to know what you have. But breaking lots of software this way is not ...

Subject: Re: [R] Failed to convert data to numeric

The zero-width no-break space character is used as the Byte Order
Mark.  That is, an official function for it at the beginning of a
character sequence
is to indicate whether you have 2-byte or 4-byte big-endian or
little-endian encoding.  It was not intended for use in UTF-8, where
there is nothing for
it to tell you, but Microsoft jumped in with all six feet and said
"hey, we'll use this to indicate that it's Unicode in UTF-8 and not
one of the hundreds
of other 8-bit coded character sets."  I've lost count of the number
of programs that have choked because they were given a BOM where they
didn't expect one.

So there is no great mystery about why there is a BOM at the beginning
of this particular string.
The real mystery is why it was there and NOT at the beginning of all the others.

I suggest that it is a good idea to remove the BOM character from the
beginning of microsofted strings,
but a bad idea to remove any other character.  If you are given bad
data like "Bond-007" when you
expect a number, you want to know about it, and not mistake it for
-007.  Still less do you want a
phone number like "+61 3 555 1234 x77" to be mistaken for a plain
number "613555123477".

Subject: [R] Issue with littler vs. R and source()
Message-ID: <b2f132fd-5fd0-4ec0-86fe-cb2548c365bc@gmail.com>

I want to use littler (i.e. "r -i ") to run an R script so I can
set up a clickable icon for a program which uses package staplr.
Actually to use staplr to consolidate two files and remove some unwanted
pages before printout.

A minimal example program is FailBill.R, which has the single line

   library("staplr")

staplr is installed, as is rJava. System is Linux Mint 22.1 Xia,
and I had to install default-jre and default-jdk to get rJava
installed. Same error came up in a virtual Linux Mint 22 Wilma,
as I thought recent upgrade to Mint might be the problem.

Starting R and then doing
  source("FailBill.R")
works fine.

But in a terminal

   r -i FailBill.R

gives

   Error: package or namespace load failed for ?staplr?:
   .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'staplr', details:
     call: NULL
     error: .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
     call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
     error: unable to load shared object '/home/john/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.4/rJava/libs/rJava.so':
     libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Almost certainly some setting/pointer is incorrect, but I've yet to find it, and see a
lot of posts about rJava, offering plenty of confusion.

Suggestions welcome. Note that the program is interactive, and RScript or similar
charge ahead and ignore the interactive dialogs that use package svDialogs in the
program I'm trying to develop. Since I can run in R or RStudio by starting them and
then source()ing, the situation is not critical, but it would be good to work out
what is failing.

Hi John,

Does it work if you run R CMD r -i FailBill.R?

Does Rscript work for you? Seems happy enough here:

Peters-MacBook-Air:~ pd$ Rscript -e 'library(stapler)'
Peters-MacBook-Air:~ pd$ cat > tmp/FailBill.R
library(stapler)
Peters-MacBook-Air:~ pd$ Rscript tmp/FailBill.R

Thanks for responses.

R CMD r -i ./FailBill.R

And, better, the approach seems to allow the full program to run the
dialogs (from svDialogs package) I need for interaction. I'll have to
see how well I can make that work in a clickable icon.

Rscript ./FailBill.R

does avoid the "error" in not finding the java VM. However, and
unfortunately for me, Rscript on the full program ignores the dialogs, but
keeps going taking whatever is first option in the dialog call. I've not
sorted out why that is, but believe it is why littler was set up. Despite
quite a lot of R programming, I've not much experience in interactive programs
that go beyond simple 'readline' statements.

In any event, Steve's suggestion has got me moving forward. I suspect there'll
be other glitches to work around, especially as my intent was to obtain a
program that was cross platform. I had been using YAD in Linux, which is nice,
but leaves out Windows and Mac users.

Thanks again.

I could not figure out why the input and output is different?

Clearly this conversion is incorrect. Is there any way to convert to

For once, that doesn't seem to be the issue here. The bug only seems to happen on arm64 and doesn't reproduce on x86_64 hardware.

> x <- as.numeric("-177253333.333333343267441")

[1] "-177253333.333333373069763"

This is the number adjacent to -177253333.333333343267441 in IEEE 754.

> writeBin(x, raw(8))
[1] ac aa aa aa 57 21 a5 c1

If you look at the hexadecimal representation, the least significant bit appears to be off by one: the first byte should be 0xAB rather than 0xAC (according to online calculators such as https://numeral-systems.com/ieee-754-converter/).

Seems that decimal-to-float conversion has a bug on arm64. Note that I get the same result with 

> x <- -177253333.333333343267441

so it's not specific to as.numeric().

Best,
Stephanie

This may be way off the mark, but is it possible that the ARM machine is using
the "new" IEEE-754 arithmetic that does not have 80 bit extended? The standard
was changed (in ways to allow non-compliant systems to be compliant) because
ARM does not have the hardware registers. There are reasons why this might be
sensible, but we need more awareness of the consequences to avoid some of the
resulting changes in results. I've had to "fix" things that weren't broken because
M1 and later Macs gave different outputs, actually not in my code but in vignettes
where I compared to other packages.

Cheers,

John Nash
(who actually was part of 1985 IEEE 754 committee, though a VERY minor player)

    Out of curiosity, what does atof() do on that platform? What does 
the following C program do on arm64? (I don't know exactly what R does 
to coerce character to double, but this is what I would guess ...)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void) {
   const char *str = "-177253333.333333343267441";
   double x = atof(str);
   printf("%0.15f\n", x);
   return 0;
}

   To my surprise, apparently R doesn't use stdlib to convert.

 From 
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/bb64b28d8cc2e2863eb664e7f83b0a7206b4b1d4/src/main/util.c#L2087C1-L2107:

/* ...

        use our own strtod/atof to mitigate effects of setting LC_NUMERIC

    Also allows complete control of which non-numeric strings are
    accepted; e.g. glibc allows NANxxxx, macOS NAN(s), this accepts "NA".

... */

   Should this be escalated to r-devel (or r-bugzilla)?  Nothing pops 
out at me from the recent NEWS ...

I now see more clearly what the complaint is.

That said, you should ALWAYS be prepared for the round trip between binary and string forms of floating point to accrue rounding error because floating point is intrinsically approximate. While there are examples of floating point numbers that can reliably do that round trip exactly (e.g. integers shorter than the mantissa), in general you should be prepared for such "inexact" results.

John Nash's point that IEEE754 has been relaxed is reinforcement that they want users to be prepared for differences around the least significant bits... but the principle is mathematically intrinsic to the scope of floating point numbers whether the standard says so or not.

So, based on the discussion points from the experts here, I understand
that this is an ARM specific problem.

However, what should I do for a solution?

I use ARM+R in my office workstation, so it may not be prudent to me
to just say ignore this problem and let Apple's Tim Cook take care of
it...

No, the problem is much deeper than that.  If your work depends on 
things that are way out in the limit of floating point precision, then 
your work is unavoidably unstable already.  The easiest way to fix this 
is to avoid doing anything that depends on the 15th or 16th or higher 
significant digit of what you are working with.

If you really need 20 or 30 digit precision, then you can do it in R, 
but you need to be extra careful with every single calculation you're 
doing.  Base R calculations won't be good enough.

As has now been explained, there is a lot going on under the hood
here. I would just note that the Rmpfr package can do arbitrary
precision arithmetic; and so can the Ryacas package, which extends
these capabilities to e.g. arbitrary precision linear algebra.

(I am just parroting what I found via search and know nothing about
details or use cases.)

Cheers,
Bert

   I agree with Duncan.  From an abstract point of view it would be 
interesting, and possibly useful, to analyze exactly what is going 
'wrong' (in some sense) with R's built-in string-to-double function in 
this case, and might lead to some marginal improvements.  But if you are 
doing anything but the simplest floating-point operations you will see 
many other unavoidable differences of similar magnitudes across platforms.

    If you feel like taking a deep dive, this is the classic article 
from 1991: https://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/bachelor/IEEE754_article.pdf (and 
the corresponding R-centric Stack Overflow post 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9508518/why-are-these-numbers-not-equal/ 
)

This is a general problem across all software. A computer has finite memory but a floating-point value can have an infinite number of digits. Consider trying to store the exact value of pi. All computer software has a limit to available precision, and that value is specific to each piece of software. You can play games to find that limit. Ask the computer what is 1 + 0.1?
Then keep going
1 + 0.01
1 + 0.001
And so forth, until the answer is 1. In this game be careful in what the computer displays (as a default) and what it calculates. My version of Excel will display a result of 1 after 1 + 0.0000001. However by changing the display you can see that Excel continues out to 1E-15 before everything equals 1. Keep in mind that this is significant digits. So if I change the problem to 1000 + 0.1 then Excel will display everything equals 1000 after 1000.001, and keep calculating until 1E-11.

You can correctly process the string. This is one solution:

install.packages("Rmpfr")
library(Rmpfr)

x <- "-177253333.333333343267441"
mpfr_x <- mpfr(x, precBits = 128)  # Increase precision

sprintf("%0.15f", as.numeric(mpfr_x))

Mathematical operations on mpfr_x give an answer -354506666.6666666865348819999999999999992 if I multiply by 2.

If I increase precBits=256 then I get -354506666.666666686534882

This approach will let you read the numbers in correctly. You will need to revisit this issue if you use these numbers in data analyses or even simple calculations. Also consider how much memory is being consumed by the increase in precision versus the available memory. This will become more problematic in using these values in matrix algebra necessary in many data analyses.

[External Email]

Hi,

I have below simple conversion

> sprintf("%0.15f", as.numeric("-177253333.333333343267441"))

[1] "-177253333.333333373069763"

I could not figure out why the input and output is different?

Clearly this conversion is incorrect. Is there any way to convert to numerical properly?

Yes, indeed; very much the same here, thank you, John.
and yes, the consequences I've seen (in the R world) have been
considerably larger than many would have expected.

OTOH, I agree (with people saying) that I (and others) had
become too much dependent on assuming quite specific floating
point arithmetic behavior (basically something like "x86_64 everywhere")
which has not been a good long term behaviour.

and "yes" (nr. 3): I tell everybody that indeed, the speed of
the M{1,2,3,4,..} chips is amazing and beating all competition
at the moment, *BUT* the cost is decreased accuracy in amazingly
many situations.

Both atof() and strtod() give the correct result on my M1 MacBook. So it looks to me like a bug in R_strtod5(), possibly something that requires extended 80-bit precision to get the conversion right.

Doesn't seem to be the fault of the ARM chip, so I'd say it warrants a bug report.

Perhaps we can learn from SQLite, which has recently put some work into making decimal / double conversion more reliable IIRC (possibly even triggered by similar problems on arm64).

	https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/eed4e1d2df599952f191182cf51646de11b110a6/src/util.c#L577

A key difference seems to be that SQLite accumulates the significand in an uint64_t in order to get 18 or 19 digits of precision before conversion to double.

Best,
Stephanie

Subject: [R] R GUI randomly resizes. Is this a known bug?
Message-ID: <7520846d-ef0e-4bed-b7b6-bb690dfc2dce@app.fastmail.com>

Setup:

R-4.4.2patched-win.exe
Windows 11

I always run the R GUI maximized. From time to time when I run a lengthy program the GUI will spontaneously shrink to about 2/3 of its size, with the fonts also shrunk, then jump back to full size. Back and forth, back and forth.

I've been using R for many years and I've never experienced this behavior before this version of R. Have other people observed it? Is it a known bug? Is someone working on fixing it?

I cannot provide a use-case because it happens in an entirely unpredictable way.

Message-ID: <CAMk+s2THV8tML6ZzdbEdtPCtDhfzy9J0q7i6+faEM-HF+-h9qg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a data frame with measurements in different conditions. I set
the conditions as a factor using a notation for ease of use. I now
want to plot the data and assign meaningful labels to the factors. I
am using ggplot2; for the x axis I would like to keep the factors but
in the legend I would like to use custom values.
I tried different combinations but none worked.
What is the correct way to assign
custom labels to legends in ggplot2?
Thank you

EXAMPLE:
```
df = data.frame(Target = 1:4,
                Rate = c(0.02078663, 0.03685543, 0.02238002, 0.05033979),

Dear Luigi,

ggplot2 will use the factor levels as default values for the legend labels.
Setting the factor labels of your target values fixes your problem.

Hello,

The colors COLS are missing from the question.
As for the labels, use


lbls <- c("Condition 1", "Condition 2", "Condition 3", "Control")

and then

scale_colour_manual(values = COLS, labels = lbls)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thank you, but then I will have long labels also on the axis, making the
plot too crowded. I would like instead to force the long labels only on the
legend...

Hello,

Inline.

> Thank you, but then I will have long labels also on the axis, 


I am not getting the same legend labels and axis labels, only the legend 
is labelled as variable lbls, the axis labels are numeric.
I am running the following reproducible example.


library(ggplot2)

lbls <- c("Condition 1", "Condition 2", "Condition 3", "Control")
COLS <- 1:4

df = data.frame(Target = 1:4,
                 Rate = c(0.02078663, 0.03685543, 0.02238002, 0.05033979),
                 SD = c(0.003043398, 0.001447410, 0.002998729, 0.002171813))

df$Target = factor(df$Target)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Target, y = Rate, colour = Target, group = Target)) +
   geom_point(size = 8) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Rate - SD, ymax = Rate + SD), width = 0.1) +
   # this is the only thing different from your original code
   scale_colour_manual(values = COLS, labels = lbls) +
   xlab(expression(bold("Class"))) +
   ylab(expression(bold("Value"))) +
   theme_classic(base_size = 15)


What code are you running? The OP code?

Hope this helps,

It looks like the kind of resizing that happens when the system scaling
factor is changed, or when the window is dragged between two monitors
with different resolution scaling factors (e.g. 96 pixels per inch vs.
150 pixels per inch). I think that Rgui.exe currently does not perform
any resolution scaling on its own; it seems to rely on the bitmap
scaling provided by Windows for "non-DPI-aware" applications.

How many monitors do you have and what are their resolutions? Are their
connections reliable? It could also be something having updated in
Windows 11 itself.

Hello, all,

I'm learning to do randomized distributions in my Stats 101 class*. I
thought I could do it with a call to sample() inside a matrix(), like:

> matrix(sample(1:10, replace=TRUE), 5, 10, byrow=TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]    8    2    3    1    8    2    8    8    9     8
[2,]    8    2    3    1    8    2    8    8    9     8
[3,]    8    2    3    1    8    2    8    8    9     8
[4,]    8    2    3    1    8    2    8    8    9     8
[5,]    8    2    3    1    8    2    8    8    9     8
>

Imagine my surprise to learn that all the rows were the same
permutation. I thought each time sample() was called inside the matrix,
it would generate a different permutation. 

I modeled this after the bootstrap sample techniques in
https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~larget/stat302/chap3.pdf. I don't
understand why it works in bootstrap samples (with replace=TRUE), but
not in randomized distributions (with replace=FALSE).

Thanks for any insight you can share with me, and any suggestions for
getting rows in a matrix with different permutations.

Your call to `sample` does not specify the `size` or the number of
values to return, so it defaults to the same number in `x`, in this
case 10.  The `matrix` function then repeats the vector of 10 enough
times to fill in the matrix.

To do what you want you just need to specify the `size` as the total
number of values you want sampled, 50 or 5*10 for your case.

So the following should do what you want:

matrix(sample(1:10, 5*10, replace=TRUE), 5, 10, byrow=TRUE)

In this case the `byrow` does not really matter much since you are
just filling in random values.

Hope this helps,

The textbook uses an extra argument 'size'. If you do the same, it should
work.

matrix(sample(1:10, size = 5 * 10, replace=TRUE), 5, 10, byrow=TRUE)

Kevin,

It is simple. Your matrix has fifty entries and you supplied just 10. R
tends to quietly assume you want the sample repeated as often as needed as
long as it can be used in whole amounts. So, you get five copies. If you
interchanged rows and columns with byrow=FALSE then every two rows would
repeat.

Ask for 50!

matrix(sample(1:50, replace=TRUE), 5, 10, byrow=TRUE)

But decide what you want. You are getting numbers in the range of 10. Asking
for 50 as I showed will get you  something like this:

matrix(sample(1:50, replace=TRUE), 5, 10, byrow=TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]   15   32   20    4   44   20   34    2   30    14
[2,]   20    8   42    8   46   45   10   27   27     9
[3,]   26   12   15   26    8   47   25   31   38    31
[4,]   47    5    2   28   13   33   19    3    3    49
[5,]   12    1   11    3   12   21    1   19   30    31

What you may want is this with size=5*10

matrix(sample(x=1:10, size=5*10, replace=TRUE), 5, 10, byrow=TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]    2    1    9    9    3    5    7    4    4    10
[2,]    4    1    8    7    1    1    5    1    6    10
[3,]    4    3    6    2    4    4   10   10    8     8
[4,]   10    6    3    2    8   10   10    2    7     9

Bravo for your unrequired R efforts.

You misunderstand the nested call. sample() is called only once,
producing 1 sample of 10 with replacement. Since your matrix call
needs 50 values, ?matrix tells you (in details):
"If there are too few elements in data to fill the matrix, then the
elements in data are recycled. If data has length zero, NA of an
appropriate type is used for atomic vectors (0 for raw vectors) and
NULL for lists.

This sort of "recycling" is quite standard in R. Though not universal.

Cheers,
Bert

Yes. If you want repeated calls to sample() you need to call it several times.

Try, for instance replicate(5, sample(1:10)) which is nearly the structure you expected, except transposed.
