The problem is presumably that x1 isn't really an integer.  While
trunc(x1) should be exactly an integer there's no guarantee that there
exists a value of init such that x*(10^-init) is exactly an integer.

The following seems to do what you want:
prec<-function(x){
  init <- trunc(log10(max(x)))
  zero<- Machine()$double.eps*max(x)
  y <- x - trunc(x)
  while (any(y > zero)) {
    init <- init - 1
    x1 <- x*10^(-init)
    y <- x1 - trunc(x1)
  }
  10^init
}

Subject: [R] batch multiple regressions and pipe results to file
Message-ID: <20021101025412.31181.qmail@web12507.mail.yahoo.com>

I am looking to mass batch about 1000 or so multiple linear regressions
with an arbitrary number of independent variables (from 2 to 10) using
the step function. I wrote a short perl script that queries a database
and generates the R code to create the model/formula. 
 
How can I: 
    1. Get R to re-run the regression for each stepped regression using
the "best fitted model/formula" it just found (AIC).
    2. Output that model/formula and extract its regression results
(i.e. coefficients, Rsq, p-values, etc) into a file in a consistent and
    easy to parse/read format so that I write them back into a
database.
 
Thanks in advance.

dear R-Guru,

Anybody knows how to change the range of Y axis in plot.stepfun.
I want to overlap several stepping data with different y ranges.  But can't make it
becaues there is no option for ylim.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [R] Flushing the R output buffer.
Message-ID: <200210312139.59114.dbdahl@stat.wisc.edu>

Richard,

I run into this problem when trying to control R from a Java program.  
Hopefully my solution can help you.

After poking around the source code, I realized that when R starts up, it 
choose between interactive or non-interactive mode, based on whether there is 
a controlling TTY.  Specifically, line 237 of src/unix/system.c has the line 
"R_Interactive = isatty(0);"  My solution is to insert the following line 
immediately after line 237:
"if ( getenv("R_FORCE_INTERACTIVE") != NULL ) R_Interactive = TRUE;"
I then compile R.  (You implied that you were adverse to learning how to 
compile from source, but it really isn't hard.  See "R Installation and 
Administration" documentation from the R webpage.)
Then, within Java, I set the environment variable "R_FORCE_INTERACTIVE" to 
"true" and launch R.  I can then write commands to R and read the response, 
all without buffering or flushing issues.

I hope this helps.  I would be interest in knowing how well this works for you 
or what other solution you come up with.

"Never trust exact equality with floating point operations."

Finite decimal fractions are not finite binary fractions and if you
compute them in two different ways you'll very likely get differences
in the last few bits because of rounding errors.

[1] 2.220446e-16

It's not different in principle from the fact that in 3-digit decimal
arithmetic 1/3 * 3 = 0.333 * 3 = 0.999

Hi David,

thats interesting, I'll keep it in mind for the future.

The solution I came up with involved using PHP to attach a script string
to the end of the command line that starts up R like:

$R_script = "R --silent --slave 2>&1 << 'END'" . $R_script;
$R_script .= "quit()\n";
$R_script .= "END\n";
$file_pointer = popen($R_script. "r");
$R_script_result = "";
while(!feop($file_pointer))
{
    $R_script_result .= fread($file_pointer, 1024);
}
pclose($file_pointer);
The script string was then massaged to extract the values I needed.
In my case I used R to format a string that was a PHP script,
extracted this from $R_script_result  and performed a PHP eval on it
so I did not have to do any complex parsing stuff.

Hopes this helps you some time.

Regards from Richard

Message-ID: <hsq4sug5gug8g78tf6d7c1nrps79hik263@4ax.com>

Any text editor should be able to do this.  If you are using Windows,
Notepad will work.  

There is one problem in the default setup for Windows:  Notepad (and
many other editors) will add '.txt' on to the filename if you ask to
save a text file.  There are two ways to fix this:

1. (Recommended)  In Explorer, go to Tools | Folder options | View,
and make sure "Hide extensions for known file types" is *not* checked.
Then Explorer will show you the true filenames, and programs like
Notepad won't secretly add '.txt'.

2.  Put double quotes around the filename when you specify it, e.g.
"myfile.R" instead of just myfile.R.

Message-ID: <20021101121924.30540.qmail@web80309.mail.yahoo.com>


Male and female symbols appear to be in the unicode specification, which, so far as I can tell, contains every symbol known to man or woman of every colour, creed, or race.

One font I have looked at is Arial Unicode MS which is bundled with Microsoft Office 2000 and later, I believe, but any unicode font can be expected to have the same in the section called 'Miscellaneous Dingbats'. The Arial Unicode MS symbols are ???? (if these are readable here, that will say something - though not necessarily how one actually gets them onto an R graph!)

Best of luck - seems to me that your question has far broader applicability than just these two particular symbols.

Though it's a bit unintuitive that
  1.253 %in% round(seq(1.1, 1.3,by=0.001), 3)
is also FALSE. However,
  round(1.253,3) %in% round( seq(1.1, 1.3, by=0.001), 3)
does work and should be more reliable.

The optimistic version of Peter's general principle is that two real
numbers will compare equal only if they were obtained by the same
computation.

Thanks, Peter! Looking forward to it.

Now: does anyone know if it is possible to get a CD with the
whole of CRAN on it, from anywhere convenient for the UK?

Being largely obliged to download by modem, it's not practical
for me (and quite possibly for many others) to have the whole
of CRAN conveniently to hand; yet I'd dearly like to have it so!

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Subject: [R] nonlinear estimation
Message-ID: <3D95559A0001EC89@webmail-fi1.sol.no1.asap-asp.net>

I would like to estimate nonlinear least squares for cross-country time-series
data. Is that possible with R? Where could I find some examples of how to
do this? 

Thank You, 

Kaisa

Subject: [R] recordPlot in 1.5.x, replayPlot in 1.6.0 problem
Message-ID: <p05111a02b9e8540bc133@[128.115.153.6]>

I have plots that were stored using recordPlot() in a fairly recent 
but pre-1.6.0 version of R that will not replayPlot() in R 1.6.0. The 
error message is
    Error in replayPlot(x) : invalid hex digit in color or lty


The plots were stored in June (2002-6-14), each as an element of a 
list named 'rpl'. The version of R that was current then is what I 
used. At that time I was able to re-display them.

Today, in R 1.6.0, when I try to re-display them, I get an error message:
>  rpl[[1]]
Error in replayPlot(x) : invalid hex digit in color or lty

The plots did have lines with col='blue' and lty=2 in them. This 
little snippet of code executed today works
  > plot(1:5)
  > lines(1:5,col='blue',lty=2)
  > tmp <- recordPlot()
  > tmp
so there doesn't seem to be a problem if I work entirely within 
v1.6.0. Which suggests that the problem is in going from one version 
to the next.

Hi ...

Is there a rsync target for 1.6.1?

Thanks.

This setting ("Hide extensions ...") should be IMNHO always off,
so that you can recognize some viruses, try to look like innocent

Sort of -- I noticed a few months ago that cheapbytes.com now presses 
an R cd for a modest $4.99. See item 38 on the list at:
http://cart.cheapbytes.com/cgi-bin/cart/scan/mp=category/se=101.html?id=cTof88sn
as well as the product description at
http://cart.cheapbytes.com/cgi-bin/cart/0070010796.html

However, this looks more like "R binaries for a lot of platforms" cd 
than a CRAN cd with all the modules.  But a well-written email telling 
them where to start on the CRAN file tree, as well as why that may be
a good idea, might give rise to another CRAN cd. They probably ship 
to the UK too.  

Or other cd vendors might jump at this.  You could talk to Chris 
Lawrence <lawrencc at debian.org> who also sells inexpensive CDs at 
www.lordsutch.com, and reads this list. Hi Chris :)

But then, maybe this is something for the R Foundation to raise a buck
or two?

A common misconception is that Mac OS X no longer uses type/creator codes.
It is true that Apple appears to want to phase them out, but they are still
there and still work, even with Cocoa applications.

My feeling is that this excellent technology should be preserved and if
enough developers keep using it, maybe Apple will have a change of heart.

So how about some brave person implementing it in the OS X version of R :-)

Here's the strange part - when I load the methods library, my function 
starts returning garbage!  No other library seems to have this impact.
>dyn.load("mdl.so")

>mdl(notCensored, censored)
$mean

I've beat my head on the wall trying to figure this one out.

I thought decomposition of the SSQ can be obtained with the split=

exist two years ago, and I was reacently made aware of it.
It might not be well known?

Doug Bates had posted a link a while back, a company selling R on CDROM.
Don't remember the name.

Would the R Foundation be interested in selling the CD (or subscription of
CD) as a mean to raise fund for development?  (Sort of like the TeX-live CD,
I guess...)

Thanks, Peter! Looking forward to it.

Now: does anyone know if it is possible to get a CD with the
whole of CRAN on it, from anywhere convenient for the UK?

Being largely obliged to download by modem, it's not practical
for me (and quite possibly for many others) to have the whole
of CRAN conveniently to hand; yet I'd dearly like to have it so!

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Message-ID: <80A38867B1DBD511A8C9009027764C8C379A34@lexchange.lexgen.com>

Dear List,

What is the way in R to plot a graph having date time (e.g. format
12/31/2002 13:12) in the
x axis and numerical value (e.g. temperature) on the Y-axis ?

I could not get 'plot()' to do this as X axis values are non-numeric.
'bwplot()' sorts the date 
values and thereby changes the order of the dates and of Y. The date/time
values have to be
shown on the X-axis as tick values rotated by 90 deg. as there more than 100
points.

I appreciate your suggestions and hints.

Thanks

Subject: [R] File access from within a DLL
Message-ID: <20021101210237.82459.qmail@web40701.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Is there a recommended method using R header files for opening files from
within a DLL?  I can remember reading something on this topic, but have been
unable to find it in any of the recent FAQs or in the help archive.

I'm using the C open/lseek/read/close functions with the usual C header files
ie

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <math.h>
  #include <string.h>
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <errno.h>

to read in a binary file.  There are some system dependencies eg

#ifdef Win32
    fd = open(fname, O_RDONLY | O_BINARY);
#else
    fd = open(fname, O_RDONLY);
#endif

but until recently this code worked fine under Win2k and Solaris.  I recompiled
the code after upgrading to V1.6 and the code still works fine under Solaris,
but under W2k it fails for larger files.  First thought there was a problem
with the compilers, so followed the instructions (very clear!) in
R-1.6.0/src/gnuwin32/INSTALL, downloaded the latest set of tools and was able
to rebuild R from source.  Results were unchanged.

As a workaround have written an equivalent library in R using readBin/seek as
described in the Data Import/Export manual (works fine but is slower).

Thanks for your help.

You are correct that summary.aov(...,split=..) is the method to get the SSQ
decompositions for analysis of variance contrasts.  

The gregmisc package provides some functions useful for creating
(make.contrasts) and estimating (contrasts.lm) specific contrasts.  I belive
that Martin was pleased with the example I provided in the make.contrasts
help page of using aov(...,contrasts=make.contrasts(...)) and
summary.aov(...,splits=...) to get the SSQ decompositions for the contrasts
he is interested in.

FWIW, too was unaware of the split argument to aov until a week or so ago.
I imagine that many people also unfamiliar with it.  So, I'll paste my
example here just to give it more publicity, :-)

We had been using R1.2.3 "print tip lowess function" as described by 
Terry Speed's group to normalize microarray data and up until this week 
the commands we were using were working fine.
First, we load our data using arrayname<-read.table("filename", 
header=T)
and then check that the table is OK.
We format the data list using setup1<-init.data() and usually get a 
series of questions to answer about the array design, using setup2<-
init.grid() and then normalize it.
Now when we type in setup1<-init.data() we get: "error: couldn't find 
function!"
HELP!!??
Please reply to true at wi.mit.edu if you have any ideas or answers.

Subject: [R] installing R on debian linux
Message-ID: <3DC306D7.4080705@yorku.ca>

I have a shiny new debian linux box and am just about to install R.  I'm 
also a shiny new linux user,
so please excuse these naive questions.

I've read the 'R Installation and Admin guide (2002-10-01)' and also
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/ReadMe, and I know how to do

apt-get  install r-base

which gives me
  r-base-core r-base-html r-base-latex  r-base-core r-base-html r-base-latex

(but not r-base-dev).  But I also see a set of pre-compiled binaries for 
debian
woody on CRAN, r-doc, r-gnome, r-recommended, ...
and I also read in r-help of peoples' troubles in installing various
R packages, tckl stuff (you need to compile with readline, or pcre, or ...)
and I'm confused because the Installation and Admin
guide is generic and I don't know how the installation process actually
works.

Can someone help, or point me to some more specific documentation
for debian linux?

thanks,
-Michael

Hi:

Suppose, I have a dataframe (with N rows) containing the following
variables:

ID  X82  X85  X88

>From this, I'd like to create a new dataframe (with 3*N rows), which
will have the following variables:

ID  X82  X85  X88  Xrep

where: each ID is duplicated 3 times; X82 equals its original value for
the first row and equals NA for the other two; X85 equals its original
value for the second row and equals NA for the other two; X88 equals
its original value for the third row and equals NA for the other two;
Xrep will equal X82, X85 and X88 in the first, second and third rows,
respectively.

Is there an efficient way to do this?

Thanks for any help,
Ravi.

Subject: [R] Reshape function
Message-ID: <20021101234640.85213.qmail@web10405.mail.yahoo.com>

Can someone help me with the proper usage of the
reshape function?

Let's say I have a dataset with columns like this
(wide format):

Id  Sex  Group   Test   Day1   Day 2  Day 3...
     
And I want to transpose this into something like this
(thin):

Id    Sex   Group    Test   Time

Where the new column labeled time contains all the
time variables (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3...) that were in
the wide format.  I just cannot get it to work right
using the reshape function.  I'm sure there is
something that I'm missing.  I just can't get a handle
on how to use this reshape function.

Thanks so much in advance for any help.

Dave

If you have your dates as strings, you need to use strptime() to convert that 
into date-time objects first.

Yes as r-base is a "meta" package which pulls in everything which other
distro packs as the main R package. [1]

Yes, r-base-dev is needed only if you want to install/built other packages.
As it depends on other packages, it is not included above.

Those troubles typically come from people using distributions other than
Debian. E.g. Gnome and Tcl/tk are supported out of the box under Debian once
you install r-base (and get the main r-base-core package) as well as its
dependencies.

Not really. There are some books about Debian which may be useful. At least
one is even included in the distribution.

As this is not really R specific, feel free to also ask me in private, or
consider mailing the debian-user list.

[1] Why so granular? Well, R is a large piece of software, and this gives
you degrees of freedom so you can later remove some of, say, the large
documentation packages and only retain you preferred format.

Debian packages of R-1.6.1, including r-recommended, have been uploaded for
i386 and should seen be available at http://incoming.debian.org. [1] These
will run on any current "testing" ("sarge") or "unstable" (aka "sid")
distribution.

The next archive installation (around 14:00h Central time tomorrow) will move
these files into the package pool from where they will propagate to the usual
mirror sites.

The build daemons for the non-i386 architectures will then complement the
i386 release. We currently have 1.6.1 beta packages for alpha, hppa, i386, 
ia64, m68k, mips, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

If you're running Woody, I'd use the packages on CRAN, since they're
more up-to-date than the ones shipped in woody; with sarge or sid, use
the packages in unstable (although you can get them from CRAN too).

To use the CRAN packages, add this to your sources.list:

deb http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian woody main

For most uses, I'd recommend installing r-recommended and all of its
dependencies (apt-get install r-recommended).  If you think you'll
need to build other things from CRAN (you probably won't), install
r-base-dev as well.

Note that for anything other than Intel, you'll have to build it
yourself or use the autobuilt packages in sid; non-i386 Debian stuff
isn't at CRAN.

(Dirk may have some extra advice.)

Thanks to Thomas and everyone on my floating point confusion,

Is there any reason why conversion to 'character' wouldn't be the safest 
way to compare decimal numbers:

 > 1.253 %in% seq(1.1,1.3,by=0.001)
[1] FALSE
 > 1.253 %in% as.character(seq(1.1,1.3,by=0.001))

[1] TRUE
 > "0.001" %in% "1E-3"
[1] FALSE
 > as.character(0.001) %in% as.character(1E-3)
[1] TRUE


If so, could R do something like this automatically?

I disagree.  If a user chooses to run woody/stable, it is because they 
want stable software that isn't changing frequently.  If they want 
something more up to date then they'd be running sarge.  If they want a 
stable system with a more up to date version of R, then I think they're 
better off using debian's pinning feature to use the R from testing or 
unstable rather than the one from CRAN.  Using pinning gives the 
benefit of having a close mirror, and guarantees dependancies can be 
satisfied.

Incidentially, and along the same track, the version in sarge is 
currently the same as the one in unstable, and when they differ (e.g. 
tomorrow with Dirk's 1.6.1), people who have chosen sarge over unstable 
will probably prefer to wait two weeks until the people running 
unstable (like me) have stumbled over and fixed any obvious bugs.

Summary: Not everyone wants the latest version, some people would rather 
have the fewer bugs.

All IMHO, it could well be that Michael is only running stable by 
coincidence and would be happier with R-1.6.1.

It all depends. Some people may just want "stable for almost everything but
very current for a few key apps". For R, using CRAN is easier to administer
(one line in apt's sources.list) than setting up pinning (which is nice for
advanced users).  A third option is to compile locally which can be as easy
as saying 
   $ apt-get --compile source r-base 
(provided you have sources listed for apt too, and the Built-Depends don't
bite).

As this is somewhat off-topic, maybe we should create an R SIG for Debian.
Might also a good idea for the Mac-heads who compete with us Debianistas for
the largest number of not generally useful postings...

Either that or a more broadly aimed list hosted by Debian; I know we
have a bunch of scientific applications and a lot of interest in
them.  Plus there's the mythical "Debian-Stat" CD to work on ;-)

Subject: [R] Success in compiling & running R 1.6.1 on MacOS X 10.2.1 using darwinports
Message-ID: <3DC3597E.6070902@bigpond.com>

Hi,

I found the problem when attempting to compile R using darwinports.

The dlcompat library in darwinports can be compiled with two differing
behaviours. Going into the source directory:
/opt/local/var/db/dports/portdirs/dlcompat/work/dlcompat-20020929, there 
are two makefiles. The default is Makefile but a second file is fink.mk.

The README file explains that,
"In the default install the behavior of dlsym is to automatically 
prepend an underscore to passed in symbol names, this allows easier 
porting of applications which were written specifically for ELF based 
lifeforms." By using the fink.mk, the build avoids this default 
behaviour giving the same behaviour as in fink
and the subsequent libdl.dylib sucessfully allows R to build.


Regards Tom Kennedy

Suppose the wide dataframe is dat.w, and variable ID is a unique 
id for each row. Something like the following may work:

dat.l <- reshape(dat.w, idvar="ID", varying=list(c("Day1", "Day2",
"Day3")), v.names="Response", timevar="Day", direction="long")

Notice here, I assumed Day1, Day2, and Day3 are variable Response at
different days. So I named the new variable "Response", and the new time
variable "Day".

Dear all,
  does anyone know how to setup a generalized linear model for data looking
like
the following example. This would be an experiment on food preferences for,
say,
snails, and I would measure for each specimen its choice made on food type
food
plus one or more quantitative (or factorial) explanatory variables, here
represented
by the snail size.
SpeciesSelected    SnailSize
    Spc1                      2.7
    Spc2                      3.5
    Spc1                      2.9
    Spc3                      4.6

.....

I believe that even in the situation where my explanatory variables were
categorial,
I shall not use the loglinear models (i.e. modelling counts and moving the
"SpeciesSelected"
descriptor to the right side, studying its interaction terms with the
predictors), because
the total count has an upper bound determined by the experimental design and I
shall
model the probability of selecting particular plant species given snail size.
Doing separate models with binomial distribution for each food type is not
correct, either,
because the constrain of probabilities summing up to 1.0 is violated.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this issue? This shall not be so rare type
of analysis, given the various customer preference studies. Of course, I can
use
classification trees (or neural-network models), but I would like to use more
parametric
description of dependence.

Thank you for any help you might provide!


Best wishes

Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Amsterdam, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for the Congolese Army.

My father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However, on one of our numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father was able to reveal this secret to me and advice that i should proceed to the Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant documents that will enable me claim the box from the security company. Already, I have made my first visit to the security company and the availability of this box have been confirmed.

On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for political asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom this money could be transferred into his/her (company"s)  account  This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.

I got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in Belgium.Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the total sum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me and my family. Also you stand to gain from any investment you might introduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.

Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your account for security reasons.

This is my e-mail address you can reach me: kyaribundi at netscape.net

Thanks and GOD bless

MR, BUNDI KYARI.

Message-ID: <51F9C42DA15CD311BD220008C707D81906FFC85B@usrymx10.merck.com>

Kevin,

Thanks for the reply.  However, I'm not clear on what's needed.  The INSTALL
file simply says to unpack pcre and copy the files to src/extra/pcre.  All
that's there are the source files.  I don't see what effect putting
src/extra/pcre in the PATH would do (I just tried and got the same error).
The list of things that are mentioned in INSTALL that need to be in the PATH
does not include pcre.  Does that mean that I need to compile pcre _first_
and have it in the path?

Cheers,
Andy

Have you checked if the PCRE is in your PATH?

There already *is* a SIG for Mac users, so this strategy may be less
effective than you hope.

There seem to be a lot of questions about using reshape(), indicating
perhaps that the documentation isn't clear enough.  Improvements would be
welcome.

Works for me (R-1.6.1, pcre 3.9, Mingw 2.0.0-3, WinNT 4.0): 
Complete build of R, its (recommended) packages, the installer, as well
as a successful 'make fullcheck'.

You have to follow the instructions in INSTALL *_exactly_* (e.g.
collecting _all_ the tools, setting _all_ the paths in the _right
order_, ...).

Hint: Read each line carefully and mark it as "done", if the
instructions are fullfilled exactly.
There will be at least one line (I guess) you cannot mark.

Message-ID: <20021102163325.GA5671@pcf004.jinr.ru>

Dear R experts!

I have the y(x) data (length(y) == length(x) == 10,000)
and I want to fit it with function

  exp(-a1 * x) + exp(-a2 * x)

a1, a2 -- are parameters to be estimated.

What the "right" way to do it?
Can I transform data to something so that linear model could be used?
Or, I must use a non-linear model, definitely?

Thank you very much.

Right. But it's easy to add that option. Just change the following lines
in the function definition:


plot.stepfun <-
-   function(x, xval, xlim, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)", main = NULL,
+   function(x, xval, xlim, ylim, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)", main =
NULL,
             add = FALSE, verticals = TRUE, do.points = TRUE,

...

    else {
+   if(missing(ylim)) ylim <- range(c(y,Fn.kn))
-   plot(0,0, type="n", xlim=xlim, ylim=range(c(y,Fn.kn)),
+   plot(0,0, type="n", xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim,
         xlab=xlab, ylab=ylab, main= main, ...)
    segments(ti.l, y, ti.r, y, col=col.hor, lty=lty, lwd=lwd)
    }

I have tested your example with R-1.3.1 (!), R-1.5.1 (record) and
R-1.6.0, R-1.6.1 (replay) --- with success.
So it is really of interest 
 a) to get a reproducable example and/or
 b) to know what "fairly recent" means.

Subject: [R] problem with expand.model.frame
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20021102120308.01db7e90@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R list members,

I'm encountering a problem with expand.model.frame(): Suppose that I define 
the following simple function (meant
just to illustrate the problem):

     > fun <- function(model){
     +     expand.model.frame(model, all.vars(formula(model)))
     +     }
     >

and I have the following model, created with an explicit data argument:

     > mod

     Call:
     lm(formula = prestige ~ income + I(education^2), data = Prestige)

     Coefficients:
     (Intercept)          income  I(education^2)
         15.129723        0.001262        0.188479

Here fun() works fine, adding education from the data frame Prestige to the 
model frame:

     > fun(mod)
                             prestige income I(education^2) education
     GOV.ADMINISTRATORS            68.8  12351       171.8721     13.11
     GENERAL.MANAGERS              69.1  25879       150.3076     12.26
     ACCOUNTANTS                   63.4   9271       163.0729     12.77
     . . .
     BOOKBINDERS                   35.2   3617        73.1025      8.55

Now suppose that I have the following model, fit with the data frame 
Prestige attached to the search path, but no
explicit data argument:

     > mod.2

     Call: lm(formula = prestige ~ income + I(education^2))

     Coefficients:
     (Intercept)          income  I(education^2)
         15.129723        0.001262        0.188479

Calling fun() with this model as an argument produces an error:

     > fun(mod.2)
     Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : Object "prestige" not found

     > traceback()
     8: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
     7: eval(predvars, data, env)
     6: model.frame.default(prestige ~ income + I(education^2) + (prestige +
         income + education), data = NULL, subset = NULL, na.action = NULL)
     5: model.frame(prestige ~ income + I(education^2) + (prestige +
         income + education), data = NULL, subset = NULL, na.action = NULL)
     4: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
     3: eval(call("model.frame", ff, data = data, subset = subset, 
na.action = naa),
         envir)
     2: expand.model.frame(model, all.vars(formula(model)))
     1: fun(mod.2)


Yet the environment of the model formula for mod.2 (which is the default 
environment for expand.model.formula) is
the global environment, and the variable prestige is accessible (via the 
attached data frame Prestige) from the
global environment):

     > environment(formula(mod.2))

Obviously, I'm not thinking about this properly. My aim is to have fun() 
work whether or not the model was created
with an explicit data argument.

I'm using R 1.6.0 under WIndows 2000.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
  John

Hi,

An R newbie here.  I am using R 1.6 currently and have
(successfully, I think) installed the Foreign package.
 Tried to import a data file created with Stata 7.0
SE.  Had minor problems with syntax then R decided
that my file was not really a Stata file.  It rejected
the file saying 'Not created by Stata 5-7/SE'.  Any
suggestions on how to convince R that this is really,
truly a Stata file?

TIA,

Bill Hart

Subject: [R] problem with expand.model.frame
In-Reply-To: <5.1.0.14.2.20021102120308.01db7e90@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20021102162328.01dc39a8@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R list members,

To answer the question that I previously posted, the following slightly 
altered definition of expand.model.frame seems to do the trick:

     expand.model.frame <- function (model, extras, envir = 
environment(formula(model)),
         na.expand = FALSE){  # modified version of R base function
         f <- formula(model)
         data <- eval(model$call$data, envir)
         ff <- foo ~ bar + baz
         if (is.call(extras))
             gg <- extras
         else gg <- parse(text = paste("~", paste(extras, collapse = 
"+")))[[1]]
         ff[[2]] <- f[[2]]
         ff[[3]][[2]] <- f[[3]]
         ff[[3]][[3]] <- gg[[2]]
         if (!na.expand) {
             naa <- model$call$na.action
             subset <- model$call$subset
             rval <- if (is.null(data)) eval(call("model.frame", ff, # modified
                 subset = subset, na.action = naa), envir)           #  lines
             else eval(call("model.frame", ff, data = data,          #
                 subset = subset, na.action = naa), envir)           #
             }
         else {
             subset <- model$call$subset
             rval <- eval(call("model.frame", ff, data = data, subset = 
subset,
                 na.action = I), envir)
             oldmf <- model.frame(model)
             keep <- match(rownames(oldmf), rownames(rval))
             rval <- rval[keep, ]
             class(rval) <- "data.frame"
             }
         return(rval)
         }

I'm hesitant to screw with the definition of expand.model.frame (maybe the 
new name space mechanism helps here), so I've made the redefinition local 
to my application, and now everything seems to work.

I'm still interested in people's reactions to the problem.

Thanks,
  John

Message-ID: <51F9C42DA15CD311BD220008C707D81906FFC85C@usrymx10.merck.com>

Uwe,

Got it now.  The problem might be the pcre packaging.  When I tried to
download it, the site at UK was unavailable, so I grabbed pcre-3.9-src.zip
from sourceforge instead.  Apparently that's at least packaged a bit
differently from pcre-3.9.tar.gz at the site mentioned in the INSTALL file.

Maybe the wording about the pcre source in the INSTALL file could be a bit
more stringent?

Cheers,
Andy

Works for me (R-1.6.1, pcre 3.9, Mingw 2.0.0-3, WinNT 4.0): 
Complete build of R, its (recommended) packages, the installer, as well
as a successful 'make fullcheck'.

You have to follow the instructions in INSTALL *_exactly_* (e.g.
collecting _all_ the tools, setting _all_ the paths in the _right
order_, ...).

Hint: Read each line carefully and mark it as "done", if the
instructions are fullfilled exactly.
There will be at least one line (I guess) you cannot mark.

You need the version of read.dta that I wrote yesterday after finally
obtaining some 7/SE datasets for debugging.  If you can compile packages
then I can send you the code, otherwise you will have to wait for the next
version of the foreign package.

Message-ID: <200211032028.22604.r.mueller@oeko-sorpe.de>

Good evening,
I can't manage to plot continous lines (x-y representation of measured data): 
The spreadsheet where the data come from has continuous x-data (0,1,2,3,4, 
...), but not every x-datum has a corresponding y-datum. At these "gaps" the 
graph is not displayed. I want to display the measured data with points, 
joined by a line ("type=b"), even if there are gaps. Is that possible?

Thanks for your help, Richard

I'm sure it could, but I would like to note that this causes a number of 
problems.  For example, the address I post from is not the address I'm 
subscribed from. You can get around this by autowhitelisting and similar, but 
it is a hassle.  I'd hazard a guess that installing spamassassin would 
probably cause fewer problems.

Also, if you have spamassassin/spamtrap/almost any anti-spam software running 
where you receive mail, then you won't see the spam anyway.  I have over 
three thousand spam messages in my bayesian spam filter, with under 100 
incorrectly tagged (when testing on the training set :).

Dear dr.Sarkar,

Thanks for your response. My dates are already formatted. 
I was having problems to display them as X-axis tick labels. 
I was searching the archives and found axis() to be relevant.
I played with its parameters a little and got what I wanted :-

If V1 is a list of Dates, V2 list of Times, V3 list of
Temperatures,

vx <- as.character(paste(V1,V2,sep=" "))
plot(V3,main="Temperature plot",xlab="",xaxt="n",
	type="o", ylab="Temp. in Deg.") 
axis(1,1:length(vx),labels=vx,cex.axis=0.6,las=2)

Thanks again
sukhaswami

If you have your dates as strings, you need to use strptime() to convert
that 
into date-time objects first.

You could filter the missing data -- for example,

         plot(na.omit(data.frame(x, y)), type='b')

(where x and y are the variables that you want to plot).

I hope that this helps,

I agree.  If I post a question to the list I often use my university email
but I subscribed using my ISP's email.

What about applying some filtering rules on the list server?  For example,
automatically reject any emails with all capital letters.

But then again, the number of spams on this list, in my opinion, is relative
fewer than some other mailing lists.

I, for one, am not impressed with spamassassin's algorithm for
detecting spam.  It would have given the message I'm responding to
points because it has a line all in capitals (the first one I've
quoted).  Another one I've had experience with took exception to the
fact that my Steven Wright quote contained the words "world's
largest".

Trying to make an algorithm that detects spam is kind of like trying
to travel at the speed of light.  As soon as a system is set up, the
spammers modify their tactics to "comply".  So it's never ending.

The eye is a better judge of spam than a computer algorithm.  I never
read the spam in question because I automatically deleted it since I
noticed it had the word 'urgent' in its subject.  Yes, it's annoying
-- particularly if you have to pay to download your mail, but I really
don't think a filter is doable.

Of course, if someone doesn't mind trawling through the rejects thrown
out by a filter and checks that they really are spam, it would be
greatly appreciated by the rest of the list provided it can be done
without holding up genuine posts for long periods.  Not a particularly
pleasant job -- kind of like who empties the compost bucket in your
household.

Well, the answer is whose problems are more important -- yours
(which can be easily resolved with resubscription) or mine. I do
use spamassasin, but it is so slow on my AMD K6/473MHz, that
I would rather have some messages which do not have to be tested
-- ones from well managed lists are obviously best candidates.

I, for one, am not impressed with spamassassin's algorithm for
detecting spam.  It would have given the message I'm responding to
points because it has a line all in capitals (the first one I've
quoted).  Another one I've had experience with took exception to the
fact that my Steven Wright quote contained the words "world's
largest".

Trying to make an algorithm that detects spam is kind of like trying
to travel at the speed of light.  As soon as a system is set up, the
spammers modify their tactics to "comply".  So it's never ending.

The eye is a better judge of spam than a computer algorithm.  I never
read the spam in question because I automatically deleted it since I
noticed it had the word 'urgent' in its subject.  Yes, it's annoying
-- particularly if you have to pay to download your mail, but I really
don't think a filter is doable.

Of course, if someone doesn't mind trawling through the rejects thrown
out by a filter and checks that they really are spam, it would be
greatly appreciated by the rest of the list provided it can be done
without holding up genuine posts for long periods.  Not a particularly
pleasant job -- kind of like who empties the compost bucket in your
household.

What makes you think the list isn't already filtered? It is, in fact,
quite heavily filtered, albeit only with the "taboo" filters that the
majordomo listmanager software supports. You should actually have seen
several mails that were manually approved by Martin and modified to
circumvent the filters. 

If my own mailbox is something to go by we'd likely have about 30-40
spam messages per day per list if they were unfiltered (quick check of
my maildir [the part that isn't specifically filtered into R lists]:
last 1000 message numbers goes 3 weeks back; 283 of them are
nondeleted, and I generally only delete things that are clearly spam.)

I think that R-news uses a spam filter already now: the level of spam is very
low, at least at the same level as attained wit Spam Assassin. Most of the spam
is incredibly stupid and gets caught by simple minded, static filter like the
Spam Assassin, but not all. Some people run their Spam through Spam Assassin and
change it slightly so that it passes the filter. Happily they are still in
minority. If R wishes to introduce a better spam filtering than now, it should
try something more clever, like Eric Raymond's learning Bayesian spam filter
(http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/bogofilter/). Actually, R list could have this
filter just for the joy of having a Bayesian spam filter. Preferably, that could
use R engine and perhaps one of the two alternative SOM implementations (GeneSOM
package, SOM in MASS) could be made to serve as a learning spam filter.

It seems you're not the only one, the line now reads:

/Join the world`s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail\./
	       ^ [changed by MM]
And incidentially, that line is considered evidence the mail isn't spam.

Bayesian based filtering? It is pretty hard for spam to keep up with 
something that changes every single message...

score URGENT 5.0?

I think you should give anti spam software a second try.

This is a fair point.  One thing debian is thinking of doing is running 
a pyzor server.  Any user can report list spam to this server, and the 
other users won't see it.  Personally I don't like that idea here since 
it requires client-side software.

There are two diffrent implementation of 'ecdf':

     2. In the R-version of S-package 'Hmisc'.
The second one is more flexible (F, 1-F, weights and other).

init.data() has never been part of R,
be it a version as old as 1.2.3 or a newer one like the current 1.6.1

Try to find out from which extra package / source file you got
init.data().

Subject: [R] persp(), x- and y-axis with character strings
Message-ID: 
    <18D602BD42B7E24EB810D6454A58DB9001CADF63@ibfftce505.is.de.dresdnerkb.com>

Dear R list,

I want to plot the yield curve in a 3D graph: the x-axis refers to time; the
y-axis refers to the maturities and the z-axis are the yields.

The following code works fine:

persp(y, x, as.matrix(ypper), xlab="Last 50 periods", ylab="Maturities
(months)",zlab="Yields", 
zlim=c(3,6),theta=130, phi=15, col="Seagreen", box=T, ticktype="detailed",
shade=0.3, 
ltheta=270, lphi=30, r=sqrt(3), expand=.75, main="Historical yield curves")

Now, I want to replace the x- and y-axis with character strings, such that:

temp<-seq(ISOdate(1999,1,1), by="week", length=(nrow(yall)))
temp.ymd <-
substr(as.character(temp),1,10)[(lastobs-index[length(index)]):lastobs]

the object 'temp.ymd' is presented on the x-axis and 

colnames(ypper) 

(another character string) is presented on the y-axis.

I know that one can supress the axes in persp(), but then I am struck by
adding them with axis() handish.

Any help?
Rgds
Bernhard

Yes, and we also want to enable authors to use all features of latex,
writing portable latex files can be very limiting, because latex
installations can be very different with respect to what style files
are availailable etc.

So you should distribute both the source and the PDF. Otherwise we
would have to include latex into the list of tools that are required
for installing packages. We would also have to standardize what
"latex" really means in terms of packages, fonts, etc. ...

Fritz

Well, as Peter Dalgaard has said already,
you have **no idea** how many spam messages you would be getting
through R-help if I hadn't installed heavy filtering a long time
ago!!
And yes, it's me who has to manually wade through many (not all
anymore) rejects and decide if they are really spam, and then
manually approve (forward to R-help) the several ones per week
that were wrongly caught.

The whole spam / filtering business is the reason, we haven't
been accepting binary attachments or (most) heavy HTMLified
messages, on the mailing lists.
Please also have a look at the "General Instructions" section of
  http://www.R-project.org/mail.html

Note that we have been experimenting with procmail and
spamassassin here, and I will probably start using them for the
mailing lists too.  Longer term, this might allow me to move all
the majordomo lists to mailman.

It could, but it will not in the near future, probably never.
The point of R-help is that people can ask for help without
having to go through a not entirely trivial procedure of first
subscribing to the list.

We have other ways of spam protection that work in 99.4% of the
cases.
Even if only subscribers could post, we would have to protect
from spam quite a bit, since many spams and even more viruses
are now spread by faking proper "From: ..." addresses
(that are sometimes collected from the *corresponding mailing
 list archives).

I don't know.. I have a function to perform NIPALS (Nonlinear 
Iterative Partial Least Squares). This is an alternative for PCA 
based on PLS which can be cery useful in the case of missing values.

Luis,

You can find  Ron Wehrens chemometrics toolbox for R at 
http://www-cac.sci.kun.nl/people/rwehrens  
It includes PLS and LDA.

Alternatively, you may be interested in checking out Julian Faraway's 
book Practical regression and ANOVA in R  at
http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~faraway/book/
There is a section on PCR and PLS.

Os melhores cumprimentos,

Hello,
I have 15 data points (weight at birth) by age which I want to interpolate back
in time (to 5 more age points).
There are many functions in R to do this and I wonder if anyone has experience
in using these -- any preference/caveat etc? I am trying to find an alternative
to linear interpolation.
Using R 1.6.0 under windows

It depends of many things...
Are you fitting a particular model?
Is the linear model enough?

  Impressive, but:

 > as.character(1e-4) == as.character(0.0001+.000000000000000000000001)
[1] TRUE

  - as.character gets it wrong -

  Wheras:

 > 1e-4 == 0.0001+.0000000000000000001
[1] FALSE

  - plain old numbers gets it right.

  Far better to understand what is going on with floating point numbers 
and their inherent imprecision, and then work round it!

     Normally there is no column name for a column of row names.  If
     `col.names=NA' a blank column name is added.  This can be used to
     write CSV files for input to spreadsheets.

See also the `R Data Import/Export Manual', as it is in in there too.

I believe rather you want a blank column before the TAB which separates
columns.

I tend to use chron for that sort of thing.

Thank you for responding.

I checked the dates, and "fairly recent" means R-1.5.0 in this case. 
I will try to get a reproducible example.

Hi,

  |I would write in tab-text file a table like this one:

I do not know any perfect solution.  But you may consider:

1) add the missing tab by a text editor manually (or by a shell script).

2) If you are going to read the table later by R, then you really do not
need the tab

3) write the names with the tab to the file and thereafter append the table
to it.  Something like

write.table(c("", names.matrix), sep="\t")
wirite.table(matrix, col.names=FALSE, append=TRUE)

4) write a tab to the file (eg, by write()) and thereafter append the table to it in the
usual form.



Perhaps it helps. 

Best wishes,

Ott

I'm not sure if I understand what you are asking.  The phrase "back in
time" seems to indicate extrapolation rather than interpolation.

You could try interpSpline in the splines package.  That produces a
"natural spline" that can be used for interpolation within the range
of the data or extrapolation beyond the range of the data.  Linear
extrapolation, based on the derivative of the fitted function at the
end points, is used.

Subject: [R] Novice question: how to solve the issue of hitting RAM limit
Message-ID: <3DE587B8@webmail.uiuc.edu>

Hello all,

  I am running a MCMC on my pc, and it shows the message:
Cannot run matrix manipulate to 335K
Reaching RAM limit.
Stopped.

  So it stopped. Guess I just stored too much data in working memory. So can 
you give me some suggestion to solve it with specific commands?

  Thanks a lot!!

Best,
Rong

Which compilers?

The most likely story is that compiled Fortran will not run because its
libraries are not being found.  Check that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is correct and
does include the Fortran library directories.

Have you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly (before "..../configure")?

It might be that your gcc or g77 installation was done on an
older version of Solaris, and now don't "fit" properly anymore.

Subject: [R] Sweave - documenting a long function
Message-ID: <8C2B4A87FC7E0147A65DC17BF4BDDC319B31F6@NLDNC006PEX1.ubsgs.ubsgroup.net>

Hi,

I would like to use Sweave to document a long function.
Is it possible to split the function's code into chunks
such that Sweave will accept each chunk without complaining.

I have tried various approaches without sucess
but I feel sure that someone has done this already.
Here is one attempt

==============
% First, define the funciton header
<<defFunHdr, eval=FALSE>>=
x <- function(a =1)
@

% Explain the code in the first part of the function
<<defFunBodyPt1, eval=FALSE>>=
{ a <- a+1
@

% Explain the code in the second part of the function
<<defFunBodyPt2, eval=FALSE>>=
 a <- a^2
 a
 } # end of function
@

% now bring the chunks together so that Sweave evaluates the function.
<<evalFun, echo=FALSE>>=
<<defFunHdr>>
<<defFunBodyPt1>>
<<defFunBodyPt2>>
@

% Finally, show an example of the function
<<exampleFun>>=
x(3)
@
===========

eval=FALSE doesnt seem to prevent the code being evaluated,
as I get an error with the first chunk.

(label=defFunHdr)
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : parse error
Execution halted

The output from Stangle seems ok
i.e. I can execute it without error.

I am on R 1.6.0, on Windows NT4.

John.

Not sure this was a fair example.  Consider the following, where we use 
the same arguments for numeric versus character comparisons:

 > 1e-4 == 0.0001+.000000000000000000000001
[1] TRUE
 > as.character(1e-4) == as.character(0.0001+.000000000000000000000001)
[1] TRUE
 > as.character(1e-4) == as.character(0.0001+.000000000000000001)
[1] FALSE
 > 1e-4 == 0.0001+.000000000000000001
[1] FALSE

Both "get it wrong" at high (false) precision and "get it right" at 
lower precision.

However, as pointed out earlier, the numeric comparison will often "get 
it wrong" when the numbers come from different calculations.  It seems 
that character comparisons will always "get it right" in terms of what 
my computer is able to resolve.  This seems to be the desired behavior 
when we want to know whether two numbers in a given calculation will 
really be treated differently by the computer.

`as.character()' is doing some implicit rounding with respect to machine 
precision.  If my machine can't really discern two decimal numbers, then 
as.character() will return them as the same (character) value.


 > .Machine$double.eps
[1] 2.220446e-16


"Outside" machine precision:

 > as.character(0.0001+.000000000000000000000001)
[1] "1e-04"


"Inside" machine precision:

 > as.character(1e-4)
[1] "1e-04"
 > as.character(0.0001+.000000000000001)
[1] "0.000100000000001"


Using as.character() is more convenient and/or general (portable?) than 
rounding off each side or explicitly using a tolerance in comparisons. 
  And it seems to be working for me so far.

Message-ID: <3DC7152B.5070908@stats.waikato.ac.nz>

I'm having a bit of difficulty using the stepwise model-building tools 
in a glm context. Here, for example is one problem I have had using 
add1, where the abbreviation "." does not work as I expected it to do. I 
someone could point me towards some examples involving the interactive 
building of glm models I would be grateful.

The data set that I am using is the "Student's Goals" dataset from DASL.

Subject: [R] Problem Installing RODBC under RedHat 7.3

Sorry, but this is a question about the installation of unixODBC, not of
RODBC.  Several of us have test-installed RODBC on systems which do have
unixODBC installed.  That message indicates that the unixODBC libraries
cannot be found.

FWIW, the current version appears to be 2.2.3, and that comes with a
program isql to test ODBC connections.  That may help you debug this.

maybe rpm -i unixODBC-devel-2.1.1-1.i386.rpm

(although from rpmfind, it looks as though the RH73 versions are:
unixODBC-devel-2.2.0-5.i386.rpm and unixODBC-2.2.0-5.i386.rpm)

It seems to be an FAQ for RedHat and other RPM users that installing the
base package only installs the runtime libraries, but to install R
packages, you always also need the *-devel-*.rpm too. Check what:

rpm -qa | grep <your_target>

says - if there is no *-devel-* package, install it!

downloaded the GnuWin32 version of the source (no idea why I did that...),

Sorry, I cannot find "pcre-3.9-src.zip" on sourceforge, just the correct
files...
The name of the file is different from that one that is requested in
"Install".

If you think so, please send a suggestion how to improve it to Duncan
Murdoch, the windows maintainer.

What did you expect?  `.' means `what is already there' in updating a
formula, so you asked for nothing to be added.  The help page says

   scope: a formula giving the terms to be considered for adding or
          dropping.

and that seems precise to me.

Chapter 7 of MASS has examples using addterm, and add1 is a cut-down
version of addterm.

Subject: [R] eigenvectors order
Message-ID: <71fba6e060.6e06071fba@teleline.es>

Hi,

How the eigenvectors output by the eigen() function are ordered. The 
first column corresponds to the largest eigenvalue? or is the last 
column as in Octave?

I'm performing a spatial-temporal analysis of some climatic variables 
so my matrices are MxN (locations*time)and I'm looking for the leading 
EOF's. As I have understand the eigenvectors columns represent those 
EOF's

Any hints will be appreciated

Yup.  Get the package "xtable".  It'll also to HTML output, if 
that's what you also want.

Good point, unfortunately I don't think you can do this currently,
because all chunks are parsed, hence have to be complete
expressions. but I am rewriting this part of the code for 1.7
anyway, I'll do it such that this will work. .

what should curretently work is to have syntactically complete parts
of the *body* of the function in different chunks, but you have to
type the header twice, in terms of your example:

**********************************************************

% First, show the funciton header to the reader
<<defFunHdr, eval=FALSE>>=
x <- function(a =1) {}
@

% Explain the code in the first part of the function
<<defFunBodyPt1, eval=FALSE>>=
a <- a+1
@

% Explain the code in the second part of the function
<<defFunBodyPt2, eval=FALSE>>=
 a <- a^2
 a
 # end of function
@

% now bring the chunks together so that Sweave evaluates the function.
<<evalFun, echo=FALSE>>=
x <- function(a =1) {
<<defFunBodyPt1>>
<<defFunBodyPt2>>
}
@

% Finally, show an example of the function
<<exampleFun>>=
x(3)
@

Package xtable has the tools for export tables and data.frames to LaTeX or
HTML.
Just read the documentation well, as often you must set properly the
"digits" parameter of xtable.
Export is done via print.xtable function.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20021105112549.022a09c8@tus001.unitus.it>

As an agronomist, sometimes i need to perform statistical analisys on 
"weird" field data, like 3 or 4 level split plot design.

I've read both the help of the program, some books and manual about S and 
"Venables/Ripley, Modern Applied Statistics with S", but i still have 
problems in (i suppose) formulae sintax.

I'm trying to perform AOV, as explained showed in "Random and Mixed 
Effects", chapter 10, V./R., on a data set i collected on turf root density 
under different turf species, substrates, fertilisation and sampling 
depht.  ..and 12 replicates
So, on a general formulation, i have a response factor, say, Roots, 
treatmens T1, T2, T3 and T4, and Rep replicates, organized on a four levels 
split plot design.
I have an old gwbasic program, simple and time tested, that can calculate 
the analisys of variance of 3 levels split plot experiment, and when i 
compare his output whit the results obtained with R, i find that i 
(probably) fail to define the nesting effect of the split plot design.

Can anyone suggest me how to specify the response and error term in the aov 
formula?

Thank in advance

It may work better to implement variations of 'pretty printing' for Sweave so that you can use different fonts, etc., from within one code chunk by using S comments.  When I'm not using Sweave, I do this with a Perl parser that does things such as changing <- to a left arrow and changing # ... text ... to \scom{... text ...}.  I define \scom in LaTeX to use a smaller Times-Roman font that for on-screen viewing is blue.  See http://biostat.virginia.edu/latex for details.  Perhaps Friedrich Leisch will consider allowing the user to specify a customized Perl script or S function that translates S code for pretty printing (including specifying prompt characters other than R>).

Subject: [R] Which columns give rise to linear dependency?
Message-ID: <sdc7b873.085@ccw0c2.nottingham.ac.uk>

Short version

If I have a data frame X and I suspect
that there is a dependency between
the columns how do I confirm that,
and how do I tell which subset of columns
is involved?

==================================

Long version

A colleague had been trying to use
the SPSS RELIABILITY procedure.
It told her that the determinant of the
matrix was small. She asked me what that meant
and I told her that one of her variables was a 
linear combination of others.
I agreed to investigate further and imported
the datasets into R. The rows of each X represent
people, and the columns items. The x_{ij} are binary (coded
0/1). Three of the datasets gave the
error message from SPSS. I confirmed that
the matrix involved was indeed var(X)
and that det(var(X)) agreed with SPSS.
What I thought was that I would find
that the smallest eigenvalues would
be zero, but in two of the datasets that was not true.
In the third dataset I traced the problem quickly
to a pair of items which were 
perfectly correlated.

1 I suspect that det(var(X)) is a poor test of
  whether X is of reduced rank. I have also looked at kappa(X)
  which gives values of 10 and 17 for the two offending scales, 
  but I have no feel for whether that is high (bad?).
2 I thought that by doing svd(X) and then
  examining V I could answer my problem.
  However the elements of V, specifically
  the last column, did not show what I 
  hoped: most values effectively
  zero and the rest adding to zero.
  This did work for the third dataset though.
3 I think that SPSS was trying to invert
  var(X) in order to compute the multiple
  correlation of each item with the others.
  Is there any neat way of doing that in R?

I am using 1.5.1 on Windows 98 if that makes
a difference.

If anyone wants to look at one of the datasets
I have her permission to make it available.

The eigenvectors are in the order of the eigenvalues, and ?eigen tells you
that.

As is clear from the output of eigen (and the help page), the eigenvalues 
are in descending order; the eigenvectors correspond to the eigenvalues -- 
i.e., the first column corresponds to the largest eigenvalue.

I hope that this helps,

Subject: [R] function showMethods and inheritance
Message-ID: <20021105143241.GJ34662225@genome.cbs.dtu.dk>

Hi,

The following question might come from my (deep) misunderstanding
of the concepts in the package 'methods'.

I have a class 'A', and a class 'B' inheriting 'A' (so defined
with 'setClass' and the parameter 'contains="A"'. The class
A has a method 'mymethod'. A call to 'showMethods("mymethod")'
return the signature of the function with A, but not with B no
matter whether I specify 'inherited=TRUE' or not...

Any pointer ?

Thanks in advance,


Laurent

I assume that you mean what I would call "discriminant coordinates". This
is part as function discrcoord
of my package fpc (not submitted to CRAN until now) available at
http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/hennig/fixreg/fixreg.html

Subject: [R] Which columns give rise to linear dependency?
In-Reply-To: <sdc7b873.085@ccw0c2.nottingham.ac.uk>
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20021105095655.01e578d0@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Dear Michael,

There are several ways of finding near dependencies. For example, Belsley, 
Kuh, and Welsch in Regression Diagnostics (1980) use the singular-value 
decomposition. Here are a couple of simple approaches:

(1) Use the principal-component analysis of the standardized X-matrix. Very 
small component variances correspond to near collinearities, and the 
corresponding principal-component coefficients give you linear combination 
of the standardized x's nearly equal to 0.

(2) Look at the variance-inflation factors. Very large VIFs correspond to 
variables that are nearly linearly dependent on others; regress each such 
variable on the others to see what the dependencies are. (Some of these 
regressions will be redundant.)

I hope that this helps,
  John

Subject: [R] last.warning and function problem
Message-ID: <3.0.1.32.20021105165258.00823d30@cucafera.icm.csic.es>

Hello,

I am a newbie in R and I am trying to create a function, that includes
several functions inside.
To avoid that everything stops if there is an error, I have this statement 

bla = function(....){
...
if(exists("last.warning")){rm(last.warning)}
...
}

inside the function, which if I use it normally, it works fine, but once I
use it with the funciotn it gives me an error like:

$"remove: variable "last.warning" was not found"
NULL

which breaks my function.
I just want to make it do: if exists the file last warning, remove it, if
not, just proceed...
Does anyone knows why this happens? How can I avoid it?
Thanks in advance.
Marta

Specifying prompt is already possible (from R 1.6.0).
See http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~leisch/Sweave/Sweave-manual-20021007.pdf:

"As of R version 1.6.0 the driver gets the prompts used for input lines and
continuation lines from
R?s options() settings. To set new prompts use somthing like

options(prompt="MyR> ", continue="...")"

In similar cases I have used condition number of the matrix (it is
basically square root of the ratio of largest and smallest eigenvalue
of a matrix, e.g. X'X where X is your dataframe (normalized)).  I am
adding the data columns one-by-one and watching what happens with the
condition number.  The normal number is around 20.

In R, condition number is estimated by kappa()

Perhaps it helps.

Hi,

Here is a summary of the replies to my question yesterday
about documenting a long function with Sweave.
My thanks to those who replied.

Friedrich Leisch suggested a work around
which was copied to the mailing list 
so I wont repeat it here. This worked well.
(I made a minor addition by adding braces
around each chunk of code to make the
output in the pdf file look a bit prettier.
This seems to work without any side effects.)

Frank Harrell suggested implementations of 
'pretty printing' for Sweave.
Again, this was copied to the list, so I wont repeat it.

Peter Wolf pointed me to noweb without Sweave

(see below for more).

Hi,

I would like to use Sweave to document a long function.
Is it possible to split the function's code into chunks
such that Sweave will accept each chunk without complaining.

I have tried various approaches without sucess
but I feel sure that someone has done this already.
Here is one attempt

==============
% First, define the funciton header
<<defFunHdr, eval=FALSE>>=
x <- function(a =1)
@

% Explain the code in the first part of the function
<<defFunBodyPt1, eval=FALSE>>=
{ a <- a+1
@

% Explain the code in the second part of the function
<<defFunBodyPt2, eval=FALSE>>=
 a <- a^2
 a
 } # end of function
@

% now bring the chunks together so that Sweave evaluates the function.
<<evalFun, echo=FALSE>>=
<<defFunHdr>>
<<defFunBodyPt1>>
<<defFunBodyPt2>>
@

% Finally, show an example of the function
<<exampleFun>>=
x(3)
@
===========

eval=FALSE doesnt seem to prevent the code being evaluated,
as I get an error with the first chunk.

(label=defFunHdr)
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : parse error
Execution halted

The output from Stangle seems ok
i.e. I can execute it without error.

I am on R 1.6.0, on Windows NT4.

Subject: [R] reading XML-tables into R?
Message-ID: <200211052030.00609.r.mueller@oeko-sorpe.de>

Good evening,
is there any experience with using the calc-modules of StarOffice 6.0 or 
Open.Office.org, which should give XML-output, for reading their content into 
R? I can not try it, because I haven't SO6.0/OO. In case it works well with R 
+ package XML) I think I'll get it.
Currently I use StarOffice 5.2 (StarCalc) as an interface; students type in 
their measured data, which I usually convert into an CSV-file. Perhaps this 
is obsolete with SO 6.0 or OO? 
Thank you for your answer, Richard

Well I based it on my interpretation of the beginning of the first 
example in the V&R discussion, also the first example in the stepAIC() page:

data(quine)
quine.hi <- aov(log(Days + 2.5) ~ .^4, quine)

This seemed to suggest that "." meant "all the predictors". Now that I 
know what "." means, my error is clear.

Does anyone know of  functions for adding the best single term (or 
dropping the worst) from a specified scope? (Respecting marginality, of 
course!)

Inside the function the environment doesn't contain last.warning. 
The "exists" function by default checks parent environments 
(inherits=TRUE) but wisely, "rm" doesn't (inherits=FALSE). You just
need to change the default for "rm" to get the desired behavior.

Subject: [R] last.warning and function problem


Hello,

I am a newbie in R and I am trying to create a function, that includes
several functions inside.
To avoid that everything stops if there is an error, I have this statement 

bla = function(....){
...
if(exists("last.warning")){rm(last.warning)}
...
}

inside the function, which if I use it normally, it works fine, but once I
use it with the funciotn it gives me an error like:

$"remove: variable "last.warning" was not found"
NULL

which breaks my function.
I just want to make it do: if exists the file last warning, remove it, if
not, just proceed...
Does anyone knows why this happens? How can I avoid it?
Thanks in advance.
Marta

There isn't quite enough information in your question to be sure, but
the following is a likely explanation.

If you look at ?showMethods, under the argument "inherited" you'll see
the comment that "methods that have been found by inheritance, so far in
the session" will be shown.  The cost of searching for inherited methods
is `amortized', in that inherited methods are stored only after they
have been needed.  So until you actually call the relevant function with
an argument from class B, you won't see the method in showMethods.

Here's an example, roughly along your lines. (By the way, one point of
possible confusion:  _classes_ don't have methods, _functions_ have
methods corresponding to the classes of the arguments.  But let's call
the function myMethod to keep to the example.)

R> setClass("A", representation(a="character"))
[1] "A"
R> setClass("B", representation(b="numeric"), contains = "A")
[1] "B"
R> setGeneric("myMethod", function(x)standardGeneric("myMethod"))
[1] "myMethod"
R> setMethod("myMethod", "A", function(x)x at a)
[1] "myMethod"
R> b1 <- new("B", a="Testing", b = 1:10)
R> showMethods("myMethod", inherited = TRUE)

Function "myMethod":
x = "A"
R> myMethod(b1)
[1] "Testing"
R> showMethods("myMethod", inherited = TRUE)

Function "myMethod":
x = "A"
x = "B"
    (inherited from x = "A")

Another way to see what method would be used with class "B" (if that was
the original purpose) is to call selectMethod, which does the same
method selection as calling the function:

R> selectMethod("myMethod", "B")
Method Definition (Class "MethodDefinition"):

function(x)x at a

Signatures:
        x  
target  "B"
defined "A"

In the printed version of the method, "target" is the class signature
for which the method would be used, and "defined" is the signature with
which setMethod was called.

check out the help pages for matplot() and layout().

Either one might get you there, depending what you want.

Hang on, what package was tsplot in?  ts.plot is still in the ts
library, and I don't recall ever using tsplot...

Subject: [R] graphics display problem
Message-ID: <F158IBjhyMVYUQMcYGN00000c2a@hotmail.com>

Hello all,

I come arcoss a problem that has to do with graphics display in my machine 
(Redhat 7.35).

This is what I did. I asked R to do multiple linear regression by:

  amodel<-lm(dat[,4]~dat[,1]+dat[,2]+dat[,3])
  plot(amodel)

  and I got only one figure (residuals vs. the fitted; instead of several
  plots), and the following message:

  Error in abline (h=0, lty=3, col="gray"):
      Error: X11 cannot allocate additional graphics colors
  Consider using X11 with colortype="pseudo cube" or "gray".

  Does it seem that X windows has a problem with "gray"? Can the default
  color used by abline() be changed to something other than gray?  Or is it 
caused by incomplete R installation?

  Thanks for the help!
  Deling

Subject: [R] What else do tab-delimited and csv do differently?
Message-ID: <20021106015120.GC11499@hortresearch.co.nz>

Until recently, I naively believed that a csv was the same as a
tab-delimited file except commas replaced tab characters (provided
of course, the characters being separated weren't either).

Evidently, that is not the case.  I tried reading a tab-delimited file
(created in Excel [2000, W2K] and ftp'd as ASCII to linux) into R 

platform i686-pc-linux-gnu
arch     i686

month    11               
day      01               
language R   

I've done this sort of thing for years, but probably not with 50
thousand rows, though I've used much bigger text files before.  R just
hung and I had to kill the process.

Saving the file as a csv file instead was much more successful.  In 16
or 17 seconds, my dataframe had been produced with no apparant effort.

Is there a simple explanation?

Subject: [R] R bug? (if-else problem in main program)
Message-ID: <courier.3DC89420.00006EC9@latte.harvard.edu>

Hi everybody, 

I've found a very interesting problem in R: the if-else statement doesn't
work in a main program. Sounds crazy, but true. 

I tried this very easy example, and I got syntax error at the "else" line. 

Example:
 -------
a <- 1 

if ( a == 1 )
 print("yes")
else
 print("no")
 -------- 

I tried on Windows and on Linux, but none of them works.
(Detailed version info at the end of the mail.) 

Temporally you could fix it in two way: 

1. Put it in 1 line:
if ( a == 1) print("yes") else print("no")
will work. 

2. Put it in a function. 

If you have any idea for better resolve of this problem,
please send me an email, I'm not subscribed to the list. 

Thanks,
Anita

Weird.

I've had some trouble with Excel before, adding a bunch of delimiters to the
end of rows, for reasons only Excel understands.

On the Linux box, try
#for the tab separated file
awk -F"\t" '{print NF}' myfile.txt | sort -u

#for the csv file
awk -F"," '{print NF}' myfile.csv | sort -u

Cheers

Function ts.plot is still available: there has never been a tsplot.

To plot rows or columns of a matrix see matplot.

If you want to split this over several lines, you need curly braces:

a <- 1

if ( a == 1 ) {
  print ('yes')
} else {
  print ('no')
}

Nope.  You have a 256 colour display, and you're running something else that's
consuming all the available colours.  Solutions are:

1) try again, but this time, a) close all R plot windows, b) use the command 
(as suggested in the error message) X11(colortype="pseudo.cube".
then try your plot command again.

2) find the most colourful applications you're running (gnome is notorious,
as is netscape/mozilla), and shut them, and try again.

3) get a better graphics card.

Cheers

Yep. And it isn't a bug, but a design issue. In interactive mode we
print the result of an expression as soon as it is syntactically
complete, so upon seeing
 
> a <- 1 ; if ( a == 1 ) print("yes")
[1] "yes"

we assume that we are done with that statement. After all, the next
line might be completely unrelated, e.g. "b <- 2", so we cannot wait
and see whether it starts with "else". So you need to ensure somehow
that the line is not syntactically complete, using braces as above, or,
e.g.,

> a <- 1 ; if ( a == 1 ) print("yes") else
+ print("no")
[1] "yes"

This is documented in many places.  See the help page for `if', or in
fuller detail, section 3.2 of the Language Manual.

The solution is to use braces

if(a == 1) {
    print("yes")
} else {
    print("no")
}

as described in ?"if".

This is not `a main program' but using R interactively at the top (prompt)
level.  It will work in a function, the only sort of `programs' that exist
in R.

The help and manuals are your friends!

Dear R-listers,

I have to explain "y", a continous variable, with two variables "t" and "p"
which are "factor variables": t is [1:12] and p is [1:18] (a value for y for
each combination t*p). OK, then I try to adjust models like: y=a_p + b*t (I
mean as many intercepts as levels of p) or y=a_p + b_p*t (as many intercepts
and coefficients  for t as levels of p). How is it possible to do that with
GLM? other package?

Thank you for advance, best regards,
EASauleau.

is an easier way,
something like writing the results of installed.packages() from 1.5.1 to 
a file and
using that with install.packages() in 1.6.1, or just having 1.6.1 read 
what's in rw151/library.

Subject: [R] Combined use of the nlm and adapt methods
Message-ID: <sdc92267.059@gwia.kvl.dk>

Dear R-users,

My task is to fit two-dimensional density functions to grid data obtained by counting particles within grid cells. By use of the adapt method I get a numerical integral of the density function for each grid cell. By use of the nlm method I can minimize the Log Likelihood function. By nlm iteratively calling adapt it should be possible to estimate the density function parameters.

However, the adapt function may change the number of points used for integration per grid cell as the parameters of the density functions change. This may cause (very small) changes in the precision of integration which causes (small) jumps in the Likelihood function. This may be a problem when gradients of the Likelihood function are small close to the minimum. I have inspected the number of points per grid cell used for function evaluation by adapt (minpts). When these do not change from one iteration to the next it is likely that the same points were used. However, a more satisfactory solution might be to fix the points used by adapt for shorter runs (e.g. five iterations). Is this possible? 
Alternatively, is it possible to output the points used by adapt for repeated use in another integration procedure? This might reduce computation time.

Minimization:
In some cases I have to estimate 6-8 parameters (when population sizes are included), and the likelihood function may have several local minima.
Will the (combined) use of one or more algorithms in the optim method be more efficient than the nlm method? 

Perhaps this is a nasty task. Any suggestions for solutions are well come! If suitable methods exist in Java the omega-hat R - Java interface would allow the use of these.

Can any non-specialist references on these subjects be recommended?

Thanks in advance,
Karsten

I don't have a windows version handy, but how about

z <- installed.packages("path/to/rw1051/library")
zz <- z[!(z[,"Priority"] %in% c("base","recommended")]),1]
install.packages(zz,lib=...)

Are you asking how to do chisq.test(m), or what  chisq.test(m) does??
Both should be answered on the help page, I think.

Well, there was a tsplot function in my tframe package for R in 1997.
Sometime between 1997 and 1999 I changed the name to tfplot to prevent
confusion, since it is not exactly the same as the tsplot in Splus. "No
longer available in the latest version" is not exactly the way I would
describe this, so I doubt that it is the source of your confusion, but
to set the historical record straight, there has previously been a
tsplot in an R package. 

tfplot() is still available in my tframe package in the dse bundle on
CRAN, and may do something like what you want. It, and most of the
others I believe too, treat columns as series, not rows, so use t().
tfplot() puts the series in separate graphics panels, which works better
if the scales of the series are not similar. The matplot() default is to
place all the graphs on one plot, which may be what you want.

Subject: [R] Combo Box Wdget for Tcl/Tk under R
Message-ID: <mnet1.1036596979.19326.Fabien.Fivaz@ie-zea.unil.ch>

Hi,

I have two questions:

First, does anyone know how to put a combobox inside a GUI made with Tcl/Tk ? I think there isn't a simple way to do this (a command like tkcombobox()!), but is it possible to write a more complex code to achieve this ?

Second, when I put two listboxes in the same window or frame (even in two different toplevel windows), I cannot select things in the two lists together. I select things in the first list, ok, then, when I select things from the second list, the selection in the first disappears... Is it possible to select things at the "same" moment in two lists ?

I'm working on R 1.6.1 under Windows 2000 and Linux with Tcl 8.4 and tK 8.4. Everything works well except for the points I stated.

Best wishes

There's quite a bit of this kind of stuff going on in Tcl extensions.
Dirk Edelbuettel recently asked me about tabbed ("notebook") widgets,
which in this regard are quite similar.

The good news is that both the Bwidgets and Iwidgets extensions have
notebooks and combobox widgets, and both ship with the ActiveTcl
stuff. (A third package, Tix, also has them, but is not available with
ActiveTcl for some reason.)

The bad news is that there's no R interface to them, and that it may
not be entirely trivial to write one, although probably not extremely
hard either. 

I looked into Tix's notebook stuff, and figured out how
to blow some simple life into it, but the "solution" didn't quite do
the right thing. 

If you're interested, here's a rough description of the problem: The
Tcl code that I interfaced to creates internal subwidgets (one per
notebook page). This is not a problem in itself, but exposing the
widgets to R is, and of course you have to do that in order to
actually put stuff on the pages. You can wrap a tk widget
in the relevant object using .Tk.newwin(), but that's not quite
enough: you also have to register the subwidgets with the parent
widget or the garbage collector will do you in when the widget goes
out of scope. In Tix's notebook there is also an intermediate
widget "nbframe" that you should register as well.

You might want to take this type of question to one of the Tcl forums since
it is a generic problem, not restricted to usage in R. Here's what I
got in about 30s of Google-ing:

http://tcltk.free.fr/tcltkfaq.php3?idxquery=59
>>>>
The default for Tk's listbox widget exports its selection as the
X selection.  There can only be one of these at a time.

To turn off this behavior in Tk, use the -exportselection false when
you create the listbox.  Or, use the

option add *Listbox.exportselection false

command in the beginning of your script.

Thanks to David Herron  for this tip.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10211060942080.7775-100000@rapid.msu.montana.edu>


Hi folks,

I'm getting the following error message when using predict.rpart on a
large dataset (say 100,000 records) within Splus:

Terminating S Session: Signal: bad address signal

Has anyone run into this error, discovered a work-around, etc.?

More generally, I'm trying to use predict.rpart to generate predictions
from very large, geographic datasets (we're talking all of Yellowstone
National Park, on the order of 20 million pixels).  Has anyone come up
with a reasonable method to process big datasets using predict.rpart?
I've been experimenting with a C program that sequentially calls
predict.rpart to process smaller subsets of a large dataset using the
call_S() Splus function, but it's really slow.  I would appreciate any
suggestions.

Regards,

Chris Wright

What I do is set the environment variable R_LIBS to c:\R\Local (of course, 
you can adjust this to reflect where you want the packages to reside on 
your system). That way, all packages (beyond those in the R distribution) 
get installed in this location. When I install a new version of R, all I 
have to do is update the installed packages (via update.packages on the 
Packages menu in Rgui).

For a start, you could copy all of your current contributed packages to a 
local library directory and proceed as I suggested.

I hope that this help,
  John

This is covered in the rw-FAQ, questions 2.4 and 2.5.

I think I would uninstall rw1051, install rw1061, move the remaining files
in rw1051/library to some suitable place, set R_LIBS in .Renviron,
then fire up 1.6.1 and update the packages.

If you use a separate library for installed packages upgrading is very
easy.

Well, I'm no expert, but my first suggestion would be to ask the Splus

    I've been experimenting with a C program that sequentially calls
    predict.rpart to process smaller subsets of a large dataset using the

How about just copying the library directory from your 1.5.1 directory to
your 1.6.1 directory?  Then run update.packages() from R.

Dear all,

I have a question about linear models.
Is there something comparable to the estimate statement in SAS?

E.g.
proc mixed data=test;

	model y=x1|x2 /s;
	estimate 'x1' x1 -1 1         x1*x2 -0.5 -0.5  0.5  0.5;
	estimate 'x2'         x2 -1 1 x1*x2 -0.5  0.5 -0.5  0.5;
run; 

Thanks for the help,

Message-ID: <AFD78192EC49D311BFAE00902798AB8F23DBA4@jupiter.arbitrade.com>

Hi,

Sometimes I am unable to interrupt R evaluation by typing C-c C-c (I assume
there is something wrong with my ESS setup). So my question is which signal
can I send to R (UNIX) to interrupt execution of a top-level expression
(without killing the process)?

Another similar problem. Suppose I have a for loop with try() around the
body of the loop so that if the body fails the loop goes on to the next
iteration. Now again I want to interrupt execution of the loop as whole, not
just the current iteration. Is that doable?

Thanks, Vadim

Subject: [R] R-1.6.0 to 1.6.1 diff?
Message-ID: <3DC964E2.1020807@u.washington.edu>

Hi, I see there are diff files for other minor versions.  Will there be 
one for R-1.6.1?  I use rsync on my Linux box which is unfortunately 
unavailable on Windows (not using cygwin).

I have a related question.  I've been building R on Windows myself 
lately because I found that is necessary if I want to build R packages. 
Is that true?  However, it takes quite a long time to build
(on a Duron 1GHz laptop with 384MB memory running WinXP Home) and I 
couldn't do much else at the same time.  So I was hoping by applying the 
patch file, I won't have to rebuild everything from scratch again. 
After all, not many files have been changed.  Has anyone have experience 
with that?

Cheers,

Michael

You'd better avoid copying the base packages, or interesting things
will happen...

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10211061415000.20737-100000@engmail.uwaterloo.ca>

Hi all,

There must be a really obvious R solution to this, but I can't figure out
how to aggregate a list.  For instance, if I read.table the following from
a file:
	Val1	Val2
A	3	4
A	5	6
B	4	4

I would like to take the mean (or median) across any/all rows of type "A"
to end up with the structure:

	Val1	Val2
A	4	5
B	4	4

in this case.  How would I go about doign that w/o doing a loop or putting
into a DB and using SQL to do this?

Thanks for any suggestions, or pointers at appropriate functions I should
be reading the documentation on.

Paul

Thank you very much everybody for your answers!
Before I wrote my message, I had tried to use
brackets. So I've discovered something, what can be
useful for everyone: 

If I put the end-bracelet in different line from else,
it doesn't work: 

if ( a == 1 ) {
 print("yes")
 }
else {
 print("no")
} 

But if I put it one line, as you wrote, like } else {
it works. 

Thanks again, 

Anita

Are you sure that's not because of some stray cells with the odd
invisible (e.g. space) character outside the region you think you're
using?  It's very easy for that to happen, so I always paste the
region I want into another sheet and use that one.

That does not report anything obviously in error.  Using
count.fields() does the same.

It's most likely an undocumented feature in Excel, which nobody will
ever get to the bottom of.  I'm not very surprised.

This is new.  I've never seen this before.  Was there any error messages?

I think either fptex or MikTeX will be fine.  From memory it shows up on

mv.exe is in Prof. Ripley's tools.zip.

I don't have this problem.  How did you installed the package?  Try to
install it from Rgui, Packages -> Install Packages from CRAN... , then
select waveslim.  I just tried it and it worked fine for me.

See help(persp), in particular the ltheta and lphi arguments.  
There are a couple of examples of their use in example(persp).

I found the same thing.  But if you write the same code in a function, there
is no problem. E.g.,

myfunc<-function(a)
{
  if ( a == 1 ) {
   print("yes")
  }
  else {
   print("no")
  } 
}

# Or

myfunc<-function(a)
{
  if ( a == 1 ) 
   print("yes")
  else
   print("no")
}

> myfunc(5)
[1] "no"
> myfunc(1)
[1] "yes"

Therefore, it may be a good idea to write functions for specific tasks from
programming point of view.

Hope this is also helpful.

Thank you very much everybody for your answers!
Before I wrote my message, I had tried to use
brackets. So I've discovered something, what can be
useful for everyone: 

If I put the end-bracelet in different line from else,
it doesn't work: 

if ( a == 1 ) {
 print("yes")
 }
else {
 print("no")
} 

But if I put it one line, as you wrote, like } else {
it works. 

Thanks again, 

Anita

aggregate()

E.g.,

0: gr         Val1    Val2
1: A       3       4

  Group.1 Val1 Val2
1       A    4    5
2       B    4    4

or for that matter: aggregate(g[-1],g[1],mean)

Overfulls and Underfulls are not errors, but warnings, that TeX
cannot break lines optimally (you know, the author of TeX is kind
of perfectionist). Actually, Underfulls mean basically nothing
for you. Overfull on the other hand (especially if ``too wide''
is bigger) will results in some lines overflowing to the margins.

Given that anything which should be called TeX is supposed to
create binary same dvi on the output, you really shouldn't make
much difference on the output with different TeX distribution
(unless there are newer versions of the LaTeX/texinfo
stylefiles).

The results: if the file seems to be OK in windvi (or yap), than
it is OK and don't bother. If there is something ugly on the
output, learn how to work with LaTeX/texinfo files (I do not
know, which package is used by R), find the particular one and
make the corrections.

Subject: [R] tcltk package under Windows
Message-ID: <2049D8AF72927143876407D38FEB4FBB06ADAB@thuja>

Hello,

Based on reading the Windows FAQ and searching the list archives, I
gather that in the past, Active Tcl 8.3.x has been required in order to
use the tcltk package under R for Windows.  Apparently Active Tcl 8.4.1
is now stable, and I was wondering whether this newer release of Tcl can
be used with R under Windows?  I've not used Tcl/Tk before but I am
considering using it for some applications.

Thank you for your time,

For 1.6.1 we require 8.3.x. We think we know what to do to get it to
work with 8.4, but found out too shortly before the release to risk
putting it in. So the binaries will want to see 8.3.

If you haven't tried Tcl/Tk before, I strongly doubt you'll be able to
tell the difference between 8.3 and 8.4...

The examples at the end provide the code. The shadow effect is added by
specifying ltheta, lphi, and shade.

I have a reproducible example.  Try this in R 1.5.0 ...

	plot(1:10)
	temp <- recordPlot()
	save(temp, file="dl")

... then this in R 1.6.0 ...

	load(temp)
	x11()
	replayPlot(temp)  

... and the tick-marks on the axis are a bit funny (dotty).

<GORY DETAIL>
I think the problem is that the interface for the internal axis code has
changed.  In 1.5.0 we had ...

    /* axis(side, at, labels, tick,
     *	     line, pos, outer, font, vfont, ...) */

... in 1.6.0 we have ...

    /* axis(side, at, labels, tick, line, pos,
     *	    outer, font, vfont, lty, lwd, col, ...) */

What gets saved by recordPlot() is the display list which is a list of
internal C calls.  What you are seeing is the 1.6.0 code being called
with a 1.5.0 argument list and the lty, lwd, and col arguments are
missing so goodness knows where they are being taken from.
</GORY DETAIL>

In simple terms, this is a danger of trying to use display lists across
different versions of R -- the information that is stored in the display
list *may* be version-specific.  Ideally we would detect these changes
automatically -- sorting out display lists is a todo item.

In case it is of any use, I have a very basic discussion of saving and
reusing graphics output at
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/saveload.pdf
This is aimed at using grid, but some of it is relevant for base
graphics too.

Dear Roger and Mike,

I used to do it this way, but it helps to keep the base and recommended 
packages, which are part of the R distribution, separate from the 
"contributed" packages.

Subject: [R] Combined use of the nlm and adapt methods
Message-ID: <sdc9b41a.035@gwia.kvl.dk>

Dear R-users,

My task is to fit two-dimensional density functions to grid data obtained by counting particles within grid cells. By use of the adapt method I get a numerical integral of the density function for each grid cell. By use of the nlm method I can minimize the Log Likelihood function. By nlm iteratively calling adapt it should be possible to estimate the density function parameters.

However, the adapt function may change the number of points used for integration per grid cell as the parameters of the density functions change. This may cause (very small) changes in the precision of integration which causes (small) jumps in the Likelihood function. This may be a problem when gradients of the Likelihood function are small close to the minimum. I have inspected the number of points per grid cell used for function evaluation by adapt (minpts). When these do not change from one iteration to the next it is likely that the same points were used. However, a more satisfactory solution might be to fix the points used by adapt for shorter runs (e.g. five iterations). Is this possible? 
Alternatively, is it possible to output the points used by adapt for repeated use in another integration procedure? This might reduce computation time.

Minimization:
In some cases I have to estimate 6-8 parameters (when population sizes are included), and the likelihood function may have several local minima.
Will the (combined) use of one or more algorithms in the optim method be more efficient than the nlm method? 

Perhaps this is a nasty task. Any suggestions for solutions are well come! If suitable methods exist in Java the omega-hat R - Java interface would allow the use of these.

Can any non-specialist references on these subjects be recommended?

Thanks in advance,
Karsten

Does the aspect argument provide what you want?  For example, ...

library(lattice)

# 10 rows 
x <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol=10)
lp1 <- levelplot(x, colorkey=list(space="bottom"),
                 aspect=10/10)
print(lp1)

# 5 rows -- each row taller than in previous plot
x <- matrix(rnorm(50), ncol=5)
lp2 <- levelplot(x, colorkey=list(space="bottom"),
                 aspect=5/10)
print(lp2)

Paul,
Thank you for the example and the explanation.

It is not a problem for me to regenerate the display list--indeed, by 
design, they will be regenerated from time to time. So there is no 
urgency on my part to detect version changes automatically.

I'm using display lists to store large numbers of plots, and then 
using the R-TclTk library to present users with a dialog box in which 
they can press the Home, End, PageUp, PageDown keys to move through 
the plots. I was very glad when I learned of recordPlot() and 
replayPlot() and found I could use them for that purpose.

Subject: [R] OT : sensible analysis of censored rank data
Message-ID: <3DCA5A02.17400.4838D71@localhost>


This is more of a conceptual/methodological question than
"how to do it in R", so anyone who cares to reply might 
want to do it off list.

I have censored rank order data .. electors have been asked
to rank the 4 most important issues out of a list of 20. For each 
individual we therefore have a vector of 20 measurements 1..5, 
where 1..4 are ranks and 5 = not ranked/less important than the 
nominated 4.
 
I would like to be able to use the full information in the ranking,
not just rely on first preferences. Nor do I want to average ranks,
which appears to be common practice.

I would like to make statements of the sort 'I am at least 80% 
confident that the most important issue is "B" '.  

The immediate thought is some sort of simulation/bootstrapping, 
which should be straightforward enough if I use just the first rank to 
denote "most important"... but that seems to ignore the information 
contained in the lower ranks.

My next thought is that I should attempt some form of ordination ..
some unidimensional scaling using perhaps a 1 dimensional 
cmdscale solution .. this rests on the ability to build a suitable 
distance matrix, which I think is possible. Or maybe a form of 
Thurstone scaling. If I wrapped this in the function called by boot .. 
a unique ordination solution for each sample draw, mapped to 1="B 
has highest value"/ 0 otherwise .. then perhaps I might be on the 
right track. (I guess I would have to do something about scale 
flip/flop, indeterminacy).

If this floundering around makes any sense to anyone .. perhaps 
someone who has worked with such data .. I'd appreciate some 
feedback.

Regards

Eh?  I have sucessfully rsync-ed the R sources under Windows.  The cygwin
port works, for example (and you don't need to be using cygwin to use it).

There will not be a patch file: the binary *.tar.gz files for the
recommended packages don't patch easily (and probably not even correctly
on Windows).

Not at all.  I build the contributed packages under the binary

A long time?  I reckon on about 15mins for a complete build on my 1.4GHz
laptop.  And there are only four or five versions of R a year!

Why do you want to?  R-1.6.1.tgz should unpack with the correct names

It worked for me when it was previously reported to R-help.  We can't
diagnose such problems remotely, but please bear in mind that they are
probably due to problems with your Windows installation.

And the binaries will work with only one version, and as this is a patch
release we would not change the required version: upgrading to a patch
release should not require users to re-install a new version of Tcl/Tk.

This *is* explicitly stated in the rw-FAQ!

(Also, 8.4.1 came out during the freeze period for R 1.6.1, and 8.4.0
was not stable enough.)

If you build the R-devel version of R (moving towards 1.7.0) you can
configure it to use 8.3.x or 8.4.1, and the latter works.  We will decide
nearer the time whether the binary for 1.7.0 uses 8.3.x or 8.4.x.

factor m at 3 levels, generated as follow :

y_c(6,4,2.3,5,3.5,4,1.,8.5,4.3,5.6,2.3,4.1,2.5,8.4,7.4)
x_c(3,1,3,1,2,1,4,5,1,3,4,2,5,4,3)
m_gl(3,5)

lm(y~x+m)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)            x           m2           m3  
    3.96364      0.09818      0.44145      0.62291  

In literature, 2 usual implicit coding process are suggested : m1=0 or
m1=-m2-m3. Does R use one of these process ? (I've already read the R
documentation on this topic, and it is still not clear in my mind).
Furthermore, how can I make prediction using this model, I mean how should I
specify the new data (especially for m).

Thanks in advance for your help

Message-ID: <89466355CEFE7244AC3A013E45641C189495AE@lsmail2.crn.nestrd.ch>

Dear all,

I'm working with Cox-regression, because data could be censored. 
But in this particular case not. 
Now I have a simple example: PRO and PRE are (0,1) coded.
The response is not normal distributed. 
We are interested in a model which could describe interaction.
But my results are depending strongly in the choose of the contrast option.
It is clear that there is some dependence in the contrasts, but in this
simple case 
I could get the vice versa effect.
My R output:

> options(contrasts = c(unordered = "contr.treatment", ordered =
"contr.poly"))
> summary(coxph(Surv(ILOG, alive) ~ factor(PRO)*factor(PRE)))
...
                             coef exp(coef) se(coef)      z     p
factor(PRO)1               0.6576     1.930    0.302  2.177 0.029
factor(PRE)1               0.0681     1.070    0.304  0.224 0.820

                            coef exp(coef) se(coef)      z     p
factor(PRO)0               0.113     1.119    0.304  0.370 0.710

There are several ways to model categorical variables, including
corner-point, sum-zero, helmert,....

In R you can select them using the options() function, namely for instance

options(contrasts = c(unordered = "contr.treatment", ordered =
"contr.poly"))

or directly in the model
lm(y~x+C(m, treatment)) or lm(y~x+C(m, sum)) and so on.

The interpretation of the estimated coefficients (and their univariate Wald
statistic) depends on the used parameterization, but the LRT does not.

vito

Well, contr.SAS is part of nlme, and it would have been helpful to have
told us so.

As a general principle the interpretation of main effects in the presence
of interactions depends on the coding except for a few special cases
(least squares fitting, balance and true contrasts (e.g. not
contr.treatment nor contr.SAS) spring to mind).  So this not a question of
`preferable contrasts' but understanding how coding works.  One extreme
view is never to look at the coefficients, only at predictions, and
although a counsel of perfection it contains a lot of merit.

Chapter 6 of MASS (any edition) comes highly recommended to those wishing
to understand coding (and it's by WNV, not me).

Dear Isabelle,

Contrast coding in R for factors and ordered factors is governed by the 
contrasts option:

     > options("contrasts")
     $contrasts
             unordered           ordered
     "contr.treatment"      "contr.poly"

The default for an unordered factor is "treatment" (0/1) coding, using the 
first level as the baseline:

     > contrasts(m)
       2 3
     1 0 0
     2 1 0
     3 0 1

     > options("contrasts")
     $contrasts
             unordered           ordered
     "contr.treatment"      "contr.poly"

See ?contr.treatment for details and alternatives.

I hope that this helps,
  John

Dear Dominik,

I'm not familiar with contr.SAS (where does it come from?), but from the 
output I'd guess that it simply sets a different baseline category for the 
contrasts -- the last category (in your, case, coded 1 apparently) rather 
than the first (i.e., coded 0), which is what contr.treatment does. Notice 
that you have the same estimate and standard error for the interaction in 
both cases, which is consistent with my guess. To verify the codings try 
contrasts(factor(PRO)) in each case.

In general, you should interpret parameter estimates in conformity with the 
coding employed. When using 0/1 coding in a model with interactions, you 
shouldn't think of the the coefficients for factor(PRO) and factor(PRE) as 
"main effects." None of this is specific to the Cox regression model.

I hope that this helps,
John

There are various things.  The C() function and the contrasts option to lm
allow a set of contrasts to be specified for each variable.

The contrast() function in the gregmisc package allows you to estimate
different contrasts from a fitted model.

Subject: [R] Save method
Message-ID: <1036683783.26541.18.camel@gandalf>

Hi

I want to use save methods but I found that the save function is not a
generic function ...

If I define 

save <- function(x, ...)
UseMethod("save")

I'll be overwriting the original save function ...

Is there another way of doing this ? or am I understanding it wrong ?

Regards

EJ

Think of what you want to estimate.  I like to think of differences in predicted values (or the anti-log of such differences, i.e., hazard ratios).  To make estimates independent of all coding decisions I wrote contrast.Design for the Design library.  Here is an example:

library(Design)   # from http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/Design.html
f <- cph(Surv(dtime,event) ~ PRO*PRE)  
# make PRO and PRE factors in the data frame
contrast(f, list(PRO='somevalue',PRE='somevalue'),
            list(PRO='someothervalue',PRE='someothervalue'))

The contrast compares predicted values for the two pairs of settings of (PRE,PRO).

I cannot seem to get compiled help working with XP in neither 1.6 or 1.61.
The ReadMe.rw1061 specifies:

options(chmhelp=TRUE) or for individual help items by help(topic,
chmhelp=TRUE).  Full text search is available from the Search tab.
According to Microsoft, to make use of this you will need to have IE3
or later installed and a recent version of Windows or (not Windows
XP or 2000 or ME) use the updater hhupd.exe at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp

So is there a fix anyway ?

Hi all,

I have a basic question, I think. How can I access the c() function
(concatenation) on C code? More generally, I'd like to handle generic
vectors in my code. I tried to use append defined in Rinternals, but it
gave me a segmentation fault.

Thanks,
Luis Carvalho.

Hi R-users,

-negative values using pch=20 (filled circle)
-positive values using pch=1  (empty circle)

while using the cex.max=5, cex.min=0.1 for points() to represent the
residuals value. Basically I would like to distinguish neagtive and
positive values at my map. How to do this.

Thanks in advance,

WHAT IS a AND b ?

Hint: this "works" under 1.5.1 and 1.6.1. 
However, the final value of a will differ between 1.5.1 and 1.6.1 under
certain circumstances. Explain why it is both, DOUBLY INCONSISTENT AND
UNAVOIDABLE.

BTW, the prototype does the same. 

The serious side of this: I think the situation deserves at least a WARNING.

Do you mean something like this ... ?

x <- rnorm(50)
y <- rnorm(50)
z <- rnorm(50)
pch <- rep(1, 50)
pch[z < 0] <- 20
cex <- (abs(z)/max(abs(z))) * 4.9 + 0.1
plot(x, y, pch=pch, cex=cex)

Subject: [R] combinations
Message-ID: <3dcac44e.b2c1.0@bestweb.net>


I need to construct all possible combinations of an vector of length N taken
X at a time for simulation purposes.  Taking a a small vector as an example:


>input <- c('a','b','c','d')
>somefunction(input)
a,b,c
a,b,d
a,c,d
b,c,d

my only solution thus far is:

somefunction <- function(x){
      ...a series of grotesque and horribly inefficient loops
      deleted to save face.
      }

For my purposes, N=20 and X=5, meaning there are about 15k combinations.

I assumed this might be a common problem, but I am coming up empty on my searches
of the usual suspect web sites.

Thanks in advance for any pointers anyone may have.

This "cuts" the z vector at zero, using the convenient slight-of-hand that
TRUE and FALSE map to integers 1 and 0, and thus gives the pch argument in
plot() or points() a vector of values of indices of the pchs vector. More
generally, use cut() to break a numeric vector into class intervals
(possibly within ordered()).

I think no fix is required, because it works on WinXP perfectly, at
least for me.

What happens if you do

 options(chmhelp = TRUE)
 ?plot

??? If the compiled HTML doesn't start, your WinXP installation
certainly is broken.

Hello Michaell


I've just written this, but it's a bit cranky.  I expect some guru
will improve my clunky eval(parse()) construction [and, come to think
of it, the equally clunky sapply() construction].

Subject: [R] Macros versus functions
Message-ID: <3DCAD77E.6070201@stats.waikato.ac.nz>

R is a function-oriented language and functions have the advantage that 
they control unintended side effects of computations on the workspace. 
Still, there are times when I am using R when I want to make a large 
number of changes to the worksheet repeatedly and where the easiest way 
  seems to be to keep pasting in the same chunk of code, or to put it on 
a file and use source("filename"). So effectively R does have macros as 
well as functions.

Question: is the use of macros in this way 'bad practice' to be 
deprecated, and if so why? (If I decide that it is bad practice I will 
probably go on being bad, but I will try not to pass on bad habits to my 
students!)

I'm not sure if I understand your question completely, but I guess you
want to vectorize as in:

 x <- 1:10
 y <- 1:10
 res <- -4:5
 plot(x, y, pch = ifelse(res < 0, 20, 1))

points() doesn't know about any arguments called cex.min and cex.max.
If I guess right, you want to extend the above as in:

 plot(x, y, pch = ifelse(res < 0, 20, 1), 
   cex = (4.9 * abs(res) / max(abs(res)) + 0.1))

What *exactly* does not work for you and it what way?

It should work on XP, and it does on all our XP machines.  You did install
the CHTML files?

There is something a little strange: when I compile it the chm files have
an index tab which seems to be missing when Duncan Murdoch does.

Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20021107164151.01238f50@netgate.emmes.com>

Dear R-er;


Using LCC-WIN32, I compiled a C program and created a dll file.

In R prompt, I typed  	dyn.load("c:\\temp\\randu.dll")  ,  from which there
is no error message.
Then I typed            .C("set_randu", as.integer(123457)) , from which I
have the following error message:

Error in .C("set_randu", as.integer(123457)) :
         C/Fortran function name not in load table

 I also tried a command  		is.loaded(symbol.C("set_randu")), from which I
have the following error message

 [1] FALSE

Here is another Fortran example to explain my problem.
a Fortran program was compiled using Compaq Visual Fortran 6 and a dll file
was created.
In S+, I succesfully interfaced with the dll file  by   	dll.load.
Now I try R with the same dll file, but I have the same error as above.

Can anyone tell me what's going on in R?
Thanks in advance.

John

  I found that (0.1,0.5) was a bit small for a point-size range so I used 
(0.5,2.5), but otherwise I think this does what you want. 

n <- 20
x <- runif(n)
y <- runif(n)
z <- 2*runif(n)-1

cex.min <- 0.5
cex.max <- 2.5
plot(x,y,pch=ifelse(z>0,1,20),cex=cex.min+((z-min(z))/(max(z)-min(z)))*(cex.max-cex.min))

R allows you to dynamically extend a vector by assigning past the end. So if
a has length 10, then assigning to a[11] creates also a[11] with value
a2[11] NA. So a is now length 11, while a2 is still length 10. So the
occurrence of a[11] has a different meaning on the assigned-to side than on
the assigned-from side. E.g.

>a <- rep(1,10)
>b <- 11
>a2 <- a
>a[b] <- a2[b]
>a
[1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 NA
>a2
[1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This doesn't seem inconsistent to me; unavoidable yes, given that you want
vectors to be dynamically extendible. Have I missed something?

WHAT IS a AND b ?

Hint: this "works" under 1.5.1 and 1.6.1. 
However, the final value of a will differ between 1.5.1 and 1.6.1 under
certain circumstances. Explain why it is both, DOUBLY INCONSISTENT AND
UNAVOIDABLE.

BTW, the prototype does the same. 

The serious side of this: I think the situation deserves at least a WARNING.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.21.0211071517520.2730-100000@selway.umt.edu>


Hello,

I want to bootstarp a sample, and I need table() for each sample taken,
like if R=100, I need all 100 table(). It seems to mee that boot() works
anly if you assing statistics, that gives you back one number, like
mean. Although the ?boot/statistics says that it can be a vector
containing statistics. table() gives an array, so it might work. Does
anybody have an idea how? I konw it can be done by a loop and
sample() function, but it not as fast as boot().
Another question, how can you get frequencies for sample values, like what
table() does, but with reference to both the value itself and the
corresponding frequencies. I would like to have those values in a matrix
with 2 col. It is very troublesome to make it form what table() returns.

Thanks for your help!

How did you install it?  Did you select "Source Package Installation Files"?
You need to select it to get Rcmd.

To do what you want, you will need:
   Rcmd BATCH todo.R
this will produce a todo.Rout by default.

R is a function-oriented language and functions have the advantage that 
they control unintended side effects of computations on the workspace. 
Still, there are times when I am using R when I want to make a large 
number of changes to the worksheet repeatedly and where the easiest way 
  seems to be to keep pasting in the same chunk of code, or to put it on 
a file and use source("filename"). So effectively R does have macros as 
well as functions.

Question: is the use of macros in this way 'bad practice' to be 
deprecated, and if so why? (If I decide that it is bad practice I will 
probably go on being bad, but I will try not to pass on bad habits to my 
students!)

 Hello,

I am trying to use BIC instead of AIC in the logistic regression model
selection.

I change "k" parameter in step() and stepAIC() functions to log(N) to
achieve that, but it seems to have no effect - I get exactly the same
models as with the AIC (k=2, default).

Is this a currently unimplemented feature?

 Thanks,

I believe that the integral of F(x)^2 in this case is infinite.  Do you
mean the normal _density_ squared?

Either way, you can use the integrate() function to check:

I'm using Msys which has most of tools I need, except rsync.  I'd rather not
to having multiple versions of cygwin.dll floating around.  Maybe rsync could
be included in Rtools?  Anyway, I found on the web an older version rsync
(2.2) for NT which doesn't require cygwin.dll and works just fine for this
purpose.

That's good to know.  I only use R under Windows occasionally, primarily for
testing the package I'm writing.  So I guess I can save myself some trouble
building it.

I heard people saying WinXP Home isn't really NT based (unlike Win 2K and XP
Pro) and may have some trouble dealing with more than one jobs.

Thanks for the answers!

Subject: Fwd: RE: [R] Macros versus functions
Message-ID: <f05101003b9f0ba3629d2@[150.203.32.52]>

Typing in statements from the command line transfers to the
computer a macro that was perhaps in the user's head.

Putting together small sequences of carefully thought out code,
in which key components have been carefully thought out and tested,
has to be, for most of us, better than trying to make it all up
on the run. An exception is necessary for those unusual people
who who (akin to the authors of novels who do the word-processing
in their minds and then gleefully use a typewriter to commit it
to paper) can hold and rearrange in their mind whole pages of code.

For chunks of code that will be executed frequently, perhaps the
advice should be to think carefully, at an early point in the
exercise, about the trade-offs between macro execution and use
of a function.  Will the same code be used at future sessions?
Which mode of operation makes it easiest to document code, input
and output data, and the sequence of steps followed?  Are there
subtleties in one or other mode of operation that would be best
avoided?

Novices may be wise to get thoroughly comfortable with a command
line/source script mode of operation, before launching far into
the use of functions.  An issue here is that much of what many
novices find quite subtle (e.g., some aspects of the syntax and
semantics of functions) becomes entirely natural and obvious for
experienced users.

Compared to the use of the underscore ("_") for assignment, a
careful use of macros may actually be quite virtuous!

Subject: [R] extracting response from arima obj
Message-ID: <005301c286ff$fa35af80$5c13070a@it.giustizia.it>

dear all,
Is it possible to extract the response vector from a fitted arima object?
For instance in glm it is allowed, by:
obj.glm<-glm(y~x)
obj.glm$y #the response vector

In arima I can't find it:
obj.arima<-arima(y, order=c(1,0,1)) #say
names(obj.arima) doesn't seem to include the response. Am I wrong?

Many thanks for your help,
best,
vito

Message-ID: <27250.1036750793@www6.gmx.net>

Reid,

Thanks that you took up the challenge of this serious puzzle (the issue
masked a bug in one of my functions under 1.5.1, which was unmasked when changing
to 1.6.1, however the issue is still in 1.6.1).

You are getting close. Your example might be seen as inconsistent, but not
as DOUBLY inconsistent. And your example will not differ between R1.5.1 and
R1.6.1. 

What if I tell you, that in my example

> is.na(a2[b])
[1] FALSE

whereas yours

> a <- rep(1,10)
> b <- 11
> a2 <- a
> is.na(a2[b])
[1] TRUE

in other words, you tell R to replace non-existent element no. 11 by NA, and
dynamic extension makes <a> different from <a2>.
In my case <b> DOES NOT SELECT AN NON-EXISTENT ELEMENT OF <a> (resp. <a2>).

Any ideas?


Jens


BTW: Patrick, you guessed right: not a character a and numeric b

Aha!  I was wondering why the .CHM files were smaller in 1.6.1 than
they were in 1.6.0.  Somehow I must have dropped the indices.

I'll track this down...

I am not sure what do you want to do. Function boot needs data as 
vector, matrix, or data.frame. Boot does work with statistics, which 
gives back vector. Give more details, why can't you work with matrix or 
data.frame instead of table.

table2matrix <-
function (x) {
     if (!is.table(x)) {
        stop("I need table")
     }
     mm <- cbind(as.numeric(names(x)),x)
     rownames(mm) <- NULL
     mm
}
Or some other way, it is just an example. As you see, nothing very 
troublesome.

Message-ID: <200211081310.OAA16627@luc.ac.be>

I have a very strange problem that I have not been able to resolve and
am hoping that someone on the list might have an idea.

I have R1.5.1 and R1.6.1 installed under RH7.2 on a Dell Inspiron
2650. As far as I know, the RH installation is completely standard,
off the CDs, running Sawfish and Gnome.

When I make plots in R (either version), the math symbols do not
appear on the screen. There is not even a space left for them. For
example, R(mu) appears as R(). When I send exactly the same
instructions to the postscript device, the EPS file produced is
correct. I assume that there is a problem somewhere in my X
installation but I have no idea where to start looking.

Subject: [R] Polar plot, circular plot (angular data): II
Message-ID: <sdcbd08d.034@gwia.kvl.dk>

Dear R-users, 

As noted by Paul Murrell < p.murrell at auckland.ac.nz > there is errors in the code for polar plotting I send to R-help under the title "Polar plot, circular plot (angular data)" at Thu Oct 17 2002 - 12:18:20 CEST. 
Thanks! 

I have reorganized the code into a structure ('pp'). This allows plots to be modified to a greater extent by passing arguments by ... argument of the R graphics functions: lines(), polygon() and text(). 
However, the use of the 'pp' structure is quite different from the use of standard plotting functions of R. In order to modify plots the fields of the 'pp' object must be modified directly. Probably, it could benefit from furter restructuring.

Again, thanks to Ross Ihaka at R-help (Mon May 28 2001) for some of the code used here. 

Best wishes, 
Karsten

Subject: [R] language inconsistency puzzle (in the tradition of Bill V enables (Hi Bill) puzzle "what is x")
Message-ID: <26752.1036763971@www57.gmx.net>

Reid,

Thanks that you took up the challenge of this serious puzzle (the issue
masked a bug in one of my functions under 1.5.1, which was unmasked when
changing
to 1.6.1, however the issue is still in 1.6.1).

You are getting close. Your example might be seen as inconsistent, but not
as DOUBLY inconsistent. And your example will not differ between R1.5.1 and
R1.6.1. 

What if I tell you, that in my example

> is.na(a2[b])
[1] FALSE

whereas yours

> a <- rep(1,10)
> b <- 11
> a2 <- a
> is.na(a2[b])
[1] TRUE

in other words, you tell R to replace non-existent element no. 11 by NA, and
dynamic extension makes <a> different from <a2>.
In my case <b> DOES NOT SELECT AN NON-EXISTENT ELEMENT OF <a> (resp. <a2>).

Any ideas?


Jens


BTW: Patrick, you guessed right: not a character a and numeric b

Subject: [R] R-Core performance question
Message-ID: <13511.1036764326@www57.gmx.net>

(full replication code and results below)

I observe a sometimes significant performance difference between writing to
a list element via [[<- and $<- . Under RW1.5.1 and RW1.6.1 I find that

  ListOfListOfVector[[SomeName1]][[SomeName2]][SomeInteger]       <-
Something
  ListOfListOfVector[[SomeInteger1]][[SomeInteger2]][SomeInteger]  <-
Something

can be substantially slower than

  ListOfListOfVector$SomeLiteral1$SomeLiteral2[SomeInteger]        <-
Something

Why is that?

The effect depends on listsize and my impression is that the [[<- more often
triggers garbage collection than $<- . 

Interestingly the performance problems of specifying an elementname at
runtime can be reduced by using something like

  eval(substitute(ListOfListOfVector$SomeLiteral1$SomeLiteral2[SomeInteger]
<- Something, list(SomeLiteral1=SomeName1, SomeLiteral2=SomeName2)))

Is it recommended to call eval(substitute()) to do performant assignments?

Thanks for any explanation
Best

Hello,

when using:  rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))  and gc() command , and looking at the
memory
used by Rgui.exe  in window2000 there is no change.
this is strange . 
Actually I need to be sure that memory is given back to the system
because the users of the application I wrote under R are opening and closing 
big files of data; 

can I rely on the gc() function under win2k?

Subject: [R] pdf() and pdflatex
Message-ID: <20021108102656.408f83b8.fharrell@virginia.edu>

I am having good success in using pdf() to produce pdf graphics files for inclusion in documents processed by pdflatex [I'm using R 1.6.0 on Linux].  I am having one small problem consistently though, which I believe I also had with S-Plus's pdf.graph(): wasted space at the top of the graph which causes pdflatex to put the graph on a later page, when the current page has plenty of space.

Here is how I typically call pdf( ):

pdf(filename, width=5.333, height=4,     pointsize=10,family='Helvetica',onefile=FALSE)
par(lwd = lwd, mgp = c(2.5, .6, 0),
    mar = c(3.5, 3.5, 1, 1) + 1.e-10, bty='l')
par(smo=0)
plot( . . .)
dev.off()

Here is how I include the graphics file in LaTeX:

\usepackage{graphics}
...
\begin{figure}[hb]\leavevmode\centerline{\includegraphics{mygraph.pdf}}
\caption{A caption}
\label{fig:mygraph}
\end{figure}

I need onefile=FALSE because some of the high-level graphics commands I use produce more than one page of output.  I am using pdflatex rather than including postscript files with latex so that I can use the hyperref style for pdflatex.

Has anyone had this problem or have a suggested solution?  Thanks in advance.

hi,

does any one have a working S-plus or R function that computes the
conditional survival function for right censored event times in the
presense of a continuous covariate? for instance, a Nadaraya-Watson
kernel or a symmetrized nearest neighbor type solution would be very
welcome.

many thanks for any solution,

Message-ID: <25.308c5827.2afd4e9e@aol.com>

R-Help readers:

I have downloaded rw1061.exe several times from CRAN and one of the mirrors, 
and when installing I get two error messages about inability to copy 
corrupted files.  The two files are:

c:\Program Files\R\rw1061\library\nlme\R\nlme
c:\Program Files\R\rw1061\library\base\html\plotdefault.html

I can probably just reinstall nlme from CRAN, but I'm not sure what to do 
about the html file in base.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any help 
would be appreciated.

You're the first I've heard from having problems with 1.6.1, but I did
hear from a couple of people having similar problems with 1.6.0, and
was never able to identify the cause.  I think that it's some
intermittent bug in the installer, or incompatibility with some 3rd
party program (anti-virus?), rather than any real error in the file.
Could you let me know details about your system: what version of
Windows, are you using anti-virus software, anything like that that
might impact on this?

As mentioned in another message, there's a problem with the CHM files
in the rw1061.exe currently on CRAN; I'm planning to upload a new
version later today.  Once that is online the bug might go away.

The pdf driver uses the MediaBox as the specified device size, just as the
postscript() driver uses the device size for the bounding box.

That appears to work correctly for me with pdflatex and graphicx.  Space
that would appear on the screen will also appear on the pdf file.
I've just run a test and latex/dvips with .eps and pdflatex with .pdf
seem to give identical page layouts.

Not if there were no objects there.  You may need to call gc() repeatedly
to see a reduction in the limits.

No, nor anywhere else.  It only tells you about internal allocations.
You could try ?memory.size to find out what you really want.

It's not reasonable to expect applications to give memory back to the
OS nor for the OS to reuse it.  It is _virtual_ memory we are talking
about here.

There is quite a lot of documentation in the sources about memory
management (e.g. in memory.c and in the Windows CHANGE file). Do search it
out.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10211081601160.17352-100000@engmail.uwaterloo.ca>

Is it possible to combine two data-frames, just taking the rows where
these frames have equivalent names?
So for example I would want to take:

d1:
  val1 val2
A  1    2
B  3    4
C  5    6

and d2:
  val3 val4
A  1    4
C  2    5
D  3    6

to merge into:
  val1 val2 val3 val4
A  1    2    1    4
C  5    6    2    5

Is this kind of "merge on equal rows" to create a subset of the two
data-frames possible in R, or would I need to move to an altnerate
lagnauge to do this?

Thanks for any ideas!
Paul

Subject: [R] Using the ``...'' argument.
Message-ID: <200211082235.SAA19354@gelfand.math.unb.ca>


Suppose that I have a function fff which calls a couple of functions
foo and bar, and that foo takes optional arguments a and b, and bar
takes optional arguments u and v.

Is there an elegant way of passing ***both*** sets of optional
arguments via a ``...'' argument for fff?

I'd like to be able to have a structure like:

	fff(x,y,z,...) {
              .
	a1 <- foo(x,y,...)
	b1 <- bar(z,...)
              .
	}

and be able to give calls such as

	w1 <- fff(x,y,z,a=2,b=3,u=4,v=5)
	w2 <- fff(x,y,z,a=2,v=5)         # Letting b take its default value
                                         # in foo() and u take its default
					 # value in bar()
	w3 <- fff(x,y,z,a=2,b=3)         # Letting both u and v take their
					 # default values in bar()

and so on.  This of course doesn't work --- complaints about
``unused arguments'' are generated and fff() falls over.

One workaround that I can think of is

	fff(x,y,z,...) {
              .
	tmp <- list(x,y,...)
	tmp[c("u","v")] <- NULL
	a1 <- do.call("foo",NULL)
	tmp <- list(z,...)
	tmp[c("a","b")] <- NULL
	b1 <- do.call("bar",tmp)
              .
	}

but this is pretty kludgy.  Is there a better way?  Am I overlooking
something obvious?

Hi,
I used RODBC to import data from an Excel spreadsheet "*.xls", but some
columns were returned as zeros. When I looked at these columns in Excel, I
found that thery are results of formula calculations and not entry. My
question is: Is there any parameter or command I need to use in order to
overcome this problem?

Adding ... to the argument lists of foo and bar will allow your first
solution to work.

imho you can copy your complete
spreadsheet in excel and directly
after that, paste about right-mouseclick and the
special paste option.
...maybe "=B12+B18" in the cell get than the calculated value.

(..make a security-copy of your spreadsheet before you do this!)

Subject: [R] Nonlinear regression and categories
Message-ID: <B9F28A2F.112B9%greenberg@ucdavis.edu>

Hi there:

    I'm trying to run a large number of nonlinear regressions on a time
series dataset, where the data will be formatted something to the effect of:

ObservationID,time,dependentvar

I'll have a number of time and dependentvars for each observation, and I
want to apply a nonlinear regression to one ObservationID at a time, and I
want to have a dataset that is the parameter estimates of the equation for
each observation (as opposed to running them one at a time -- I have several
million I need to do).  Is there a way to get R to run a nonlinear
regression based on the above or similar data structure, and return a
database of ObservationID, parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 for each
observation?

Thanks!

Have a look at nlsList in the nlme package. You might want to have the
book by Pinheiro+Bates handy to see how the pieces fit together.

In general, R is a programming language, so it's fairly easy to do
this kind of thing even when there is no canned implememntation.
Notice in particular the use of implicit loops and their associated
collection of results. For instance, if you want to avoid nlsList's
habit of storing all the fitted models, you could use by()
constructions instead.

Stuff like

example(nlsList)
do.call("rbind",lapply(fm1,coef)) 

# or, using the same data and model

lst <- by(CO2, CO2$Plant, function(x)coef(nls(uptake~SSasympOff(conc,
          Asym, lrc, c0),data=x, start = c(Asym = 30, lrc = -4.5, c0 = 52)))) 
do.call("rbind", lst)

(if the nls() call can fail, you may need a try() construct)

I just downloaded rw1061.exe from CRAN and got an error message when
installing it: "lapack.dll is corrupted". Never got this kind of message
before. Did anyone meet this problem (it takes me an hour to download
the file: I am slightly reluctant to try again before being sure the
problem does not come from the archive).

Best,

Check out nlsList in package nlme, although don't expect to be able to do
several million at once.

use the mouse to copy the cells/sheet of interest ... move to a new sheet 
then <right click>, choose 'paste special', activate the 'values' button, 
then paste.

Use this static sheet in your RODBC connection.

Excel formulae are stored elsewhere and, so far as I know, aren't visible 
to SQL,

This is probably a problem with your download (unless you got it from
a mirror that somehow has a corrupted copy).  

I have heard from 3 other people about errors with the downloaded
version.  In the one case that I followed up with most closely, it was
a bad download.

To help diagnose problems like this, I've put files containing
checksums online. They should be visible tomorrow.

To use them, download md5sum.txt from the main directory (for
rw1061.exe) or from the mini directory (for all the mini*.* files).
Then find a copy of md5sum.exe and (while in the directory containing
the downloads) run

  md5sum --check md5sum.txt

This will almost certainly detect any download errors.

I'm working on finding a copy of md5sum.exe that I can also make
available for download for people who don't already have a copy.  

For what it's worth, all the other 3 examples of people who had
download problems were using Windows 2000, but I've also heard of
people using Win2K who had no problems.  I don't know the cause yet.

Duncan,

There is a Windows version of md5sum available at:

http://www.md5summer.org/

This is the version listed at LinuxISO.org.

There is another available at:

http://www.etree.org/md5com.html

HTH.

Hi,
I hope this is my last stupid question for this project. I run (WinXP) Rcmd* 
BATCH ToDo.R and want the produced graph to be seen on the display. But after 
a part of a second the graphics window is closed again. I suppose, because 
Rcmd does not work interactive, there will be no command like "wait for key 
pressed" or similar. Is there a possibility to let the window open as long as 
the user wishes?
(Rcmd is called from a macro within a spreadsheet file to display a graphic

table()

Learn how to use the help system too.  When that fails, use my
help page.

A neat trick with table() is that you can use it to tabulate
columns of a matrix (for example) with:

apply(mymatrix,2,table)

Another neat trick is that you can plot it with plot() or
mosaicplot().

Subject: [R] building a formula for glm() with 30,000 independent variables
Message-ID: <3DCE6D23.7050104@eecs.berkeley.edu>

I would like to use R to perform a logistic regression with about
30,000 independent variables.  That's right, thirty thousand.  Most
will be irrelevant: the intent is to use the regression to identify
the few that actually matter.

Among other things, this calls for giving glm() a colossal "y ~ ..."
formula with thirty thousand summed terms on its right hand side.  I
build up the formula as a string and then call as.formula() to convert
it.  Unfortunately, the conversion fails.  The parser reports that it
has overflowed its stack.  :-(

Is there any way to pull this off in R?  Can anyone suggest
alternatives to glm() or to R itself that might be capable of handling
a problem of this size?  Or am I insane to even be considering an
analysis like this?

Thanks!

See ?xtabs, ?table, and ?ftable. As well, apropos("tab") or 
apropos("table") is a good way of finding these functions.

One place to start is the R GDAL package:

http://keittlab.bio.sunysb.edu/R/GDAL/

which reads a number of formats, and writes a number too. This gives a
basis for prototyping a loose linkage. We use MFworks, and I have written
a loose linkage interface (some time ago) using connections to import an
exported binary raster map into R. The devil was in the details - the
byte-swapping in the Windows manual was, as far as I recall, wrong in
relation to the user guide. I don't know how easy it would be to do tight
coupling, reading into R from MFWorks' own project data store, or writing
from R to the MFWorks project store. GRASS can be compiled under cygwin,
and the R-GRASS interface is reported as working under Windows. Please
contact me off-list if that might help. Maybe GDAL will do what you need,
using the TIFF/GEOTIFF format, since MFWorks imports TIFF/GEOTIFF, and
exports TIFF.

Just a silly question:
If you have 30.000 independent variables, how many records do you have?

Have you consider projection pursuit?

Well, the theory of perceptrons says you will find perfect discrimination
with high probability even if there is no structure unless n is well in
excess of 2p.  So you do have 100,000 units?  If so you have many
gigabytes of data and no R implementation I know of will do this for you.
Also, the QR decomposition would take a very long time.

You could call glm.fit directly if you could form the design matrix
somehow but I doubt if this would run in an acceptable time.

I would expect severe biases, lack of preservation of type I error, and low probability of selecting the "correct" variables.  The "few that actually matter" will likely be those whose estimates are made with the most error.

I do not.  Not by a long shot.

Hmmm.  Looks like the problems with R are not as significant as the 
problems with my own understanding of how to model my data in a sound 
manner.

Thanks for the warning, Brian.  I'll have to give this some more thought.

I hadn't, but perhaps I should.  Can you tell me more about what this 
is, or point me at a good tutorial?  [I'm a real novice at statistical

....if you have really enough cases isn't it at first a technical challenge
;-)
( the statistical sense ?)
my suggestion is, try weka (www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
, a very big linux-machine? +  "data-base for large application"   & perhaps
the Attribute Evaluator
as Meta-Classifier (logistic regresssion is possible,too!) is a interesting
tool for you !?

 i didn't now weka have the possibilty and perhaps crash , too.
But in the past there where some topics (search the mailing list archive)
about data-mining purposes with ~ 2 GB data - good luck !

regards,christian

You could call glm.fit directly. It takes a design matrix rather than a
formula.

You'll still have some trouble with inverting the 30,000x30,000
information matrix, and of course it will be singular if you don't have
30,000 observations.

Since there are 2^30000 possible submodels, finding the good ones isn't
going to be easy either.  My guess is that you want to do something else,
but I don't know what.

If the design matrix for such a model is dense then this sounds
quite hopeless, but if (as I suspect) it is quite sparse, then glm
could be adapted along the lines of the  slm.fit.csr code in the
SparseM package submitted a few weeks ago.  I've run penalized l1
estimation problems of this size, say n= 120,000  by p=30,000,
on my now antiquated ultra 2, with half a gig of memory.  The trick
of course is that only the non zero elements of X are stored and
there are only about 500,000 of these in my applications.

Subject: [R] binomial glm for relevant feature selection?
Message-ID: <3DCEF0A9.7020802@eecs.berkeley.edu>

As suggested in my earlier message, I have a large population of 
independent variables and a binary dependent outcome.  It is expected 
that only a few of the independent variables actually contribute to the 
outcome, and I'd like to find those.

If it wasn't already obvious, I am *not* a statistician.  Not even 
close.  :-)  Statistician colleagues have suggested that I use logistic 
regression for this problem.  My understanding is that logistic 
regression is available in R as glm(..., family=binomial).

When I use this solver on fictitious data, though, the answers I expect 
are not the answers I see.  Consider the following fictitious data, 
where "z" is the dependent binary outcome, "y" is irrelevant noise, and 
"x" is actually relevant to predicting the outcome:

	  x y z
	1 8 7 1
	2 8 3 1
	3 0 5 0
	4 0 9 0
	5 8 1 1

If I feed this data to glm(z ~ x + y) using the default gaussian family, 
the results make some sense to me.  The estimated coefficient for x is 
positive and the corresponding "Pr(>|t|)" value is tiny (<2e-16), which 
I take to imply a high degree of confidence that larger values of x 
correlate with increased likelihood of z.  Conversely, the estimated 
coefficient for y has a "Pr(>|t|)" value of 0.552, which I take to imply 
that there is no strong correlation between y and z.  Good.

However, I've been told that I want to use family=binomial for a 
logistic regression problem with a binary dependent outcome like this. 
If I give this data to glm(z ~ x + y, family=binomial), the results 
become quite mysterious.  I receive a warning that "Algorithm did not 
converge".  The "Pr(>|t|)" values for x and y are 0.916 and 1.000 
respectively, which would seem to indicate that neither one correlates 
with the outcome.

I realize that this is not a problem with R.  It is a problem with my 
understanding of what R is doing.  But you all have been so helpful thus 
far, perhaps I can impose on you to give me one more clue?  What am I 
doing wrong here?  What should I be looking at that I'm not?

Thank you, once again!

You have not really given enough background to enable much help to be 
given. I have several ideas, but how sensible they might be depends on 
your situation. Several people have asked how many cases you have, and 
so do I.

It seems to me unlikely that you have 30000 predictors that are all 
qualitatively different. I imagine that you must have a family or 
families of related predictors that are themselves described by 
numerical parameters. Knowledge of any structure on the predictors may 
suggest strategies for choosing representative predictors.

A crude measure of strength of a predictor X might be obtained by 
calculating a two-sample t statistic for the X values of the 0 and 1 
responses. Once a small set of strong predictors has been found you 
might like to fit the model based on them and calculate the deviance 
residuals.

Then you could treat these residuals as responses and consider variable 
selection in *linear* models predicing them.

Subject: [R] Making a new generic {was "Save method"}
In-Reply-To: <15819.30460.32422.538885@gargle.gargle.HOWL>
Message-ID: <000101c2891b$f9ac5be0$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

Dear all, I have been struggling to find a way of creating generic
functions in a safe way that do not make any assumptions on what
packages have been loaded before my packages are loaded. For this reason
there needs to be some conditioning involved when you generate a generic
function, e.g. a test whether a generic function and/or a default
function already exist or not. In the end I ended up writing a
setGenericS3() method, which does all these checks for you and also
checks some other things. I have been using it for more than one year
now in several different packages and bundles and it seems to work
pretty good. For the source code and for a detailed discussion about
creating generic functions, see
http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/setGenericS3/. Please feel free to
comment on this and/or to improve the code.

Subject: [R] Macros and functions
Message-ID: <200211110107.gAB17gp15259@leonard.anu.edu.au>

The following failed to make it to r-help when Murray
Jorgensen sent his message a little time ago.
[It seems to have been an issue of the machine from which
my message originated.]

Typing in statements from the command line transfers to the
computer a macro that was perhaps in the user's head.

Putting together small sequences of carefully thought out code,
in which key components have been carefully thought out and tested,
has to be, for most of us, better than trying to make it all up
on the run. An exception is necessary for those unusual people
who who (akin to the authors of novels who do the word-processing
in their minds and then gleefully use a typewriter to commit it
to paper) can hold and rearrange in their mind whole pages of code.

For chunks of code that will be executed frequently, perhaps the
advice should be to think carefully, at an early point in the
exercise, about the trade-offs between macro execution and use
of a function.  Will the same code be used at future sessions?
Which mode of operation makes it easiest to document code, input
and output data, and the sequence of steps followed?  Are there
subtleties in one or other mode of operation that would be best
avoided?

Novices may be wise to get thoroughly comfortable with a command
line/source script mode of operation, before launching far into
the use of functions.  An issue here is that much of what many
novices find quite subtle (e.g., some aspects of the syntax and
semantics of functions) becomes entirely natural and obvious for
experienced users.

Compared to the use of the underscore ("_") for assignment, a
careful use of macros may actually be quite virtuous!

In a way, that was intentional.  I was hoping that my problem was merely 
a matter of proper R usage.  But several of you have politely pointed 
out that my underlying thinking about the statistics itself is flawed. 
With 30,000 predictors and an order of magnitude *fewer* observations, I 
should expect to find a bogus but perfectly predictive model even if 
everything were random noise.

Understood.  Since my statistics background is so weak, perhaps it would 
be wise at this point to explain what exactly I am trying to accomplish, 
and thereby better leverage this list's expertise.

The "predictors" here are randomly sampled observations of the behavior 
of a running program.  We decide in advance what things to observe.  For 
example, we might decide to check whether a particular pointer on a 
particular line is null.  So that would give us two counters: one 
telling us how many times it was seen to be null, and one telling us how 
many times it was seen to be not null.

A similar sort of instrumentation would be to guess that a pair of 
program variables might related in some way.  At random intervals we 
check their values and increment one of three counters depending on 
whether the first is less then, equal to, or greater than the second. 
So that would give us a trio of related predictors.

We don't update these counters every time a given line of code executes, 
though:  we randomly sample perhaps 1/100 or 1/1000.  The samples are 
fair in the sense that each sampling opportunity is taken or skipped 
randomly and independently from each other opportunity.

The "dependent outcome" is whether the program ultimately crashes or 
exits successfully.  The goal is to identify those program behaviors 
which are strongly predictive of an eventual crash.  For example, if the 
program has a single buffer overrun bug, we might discover that the 
"(index > limit) on line 196" counter is nonzero every time we crash, 
but is zero for most runs that do not crash.

(Most, but not all.  Sometimes you can overrun a buffer but not crash. 
"Getting lucky" is part of what we're trying to express in our model.)

In my current experiment, I have about 10,000 pairs of program variables 
being compared with a "less", "equal", and "greater" counter for each. 
Thus, 30,000 predictors.  Almost all of these should be irrelevant.  And 
they certainly are not independent of each other.  Looking along the 
other axis, I've got about 3300 distinct program runs, of which roughly 
one fifth crash.  I have complete and perfect counter information for 
all of these runs, which I can easily postprocess to simulate sampled 
counters with any desired sampling density.

I'm getting the distinct impression that a standard logistic regression 
with 30,000 predictors is *not* a practical approach.  What should I be 
using instead?  I'm frustrated by the fact that while the problem seems 
conceptually simple enough, I just don't have the statistics background 
required to know how to solve it correctly.  If any of you have any 
suggestions, I certainly welcome them.

Thank you, one and all.  You've been quite generous with your advice 
already, and I certainly do appreciate it.

Message-ID: <000001c2894b$06864310$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

>From R v1.6.0 there has been a new test added to the library() code.
This test is performed when library() is ran on a "unix" system and it
verifies that the "Built" platform (from the DESCRIPTION file) is
"compatible" with the current platform. Here is the code extract from
the local function testRversion() of library() that I am talking about:

            if (.Platform$OS.type == "unix") {
                platform <- builtFields[2]
                m <- agrep(platform, R.version$platform)
                if (!length(m)) 
                  stop(paste("package", fields[1, "Package"], 
                    "was built for", platform), call. = FALSE)
            }

For example, I have built a package using pure (100%) R code, which
should be able to run anywhere. However, since the "Built" line in my
DESCRIPTION says

  Built: R 1.5.1;  Win32;  2002-11-11 10:44:35

It won't pass this test on a unix machine, e.g. OSX. Unfortunately, at
the place I am the next few months I have no way of testing
compatibility issues under Unix etc and learning more about this myself.
However, I can not see the reason for this test at this step in the
loading of a package? I would understand the test if the package loaded
relies on native code etc, but not for packages written in pure R. An
answer would most likely enlighten me or maybe suggest a less "brutal"
test.

My current idea for a workaround of this problem is simply to replace
the "Win32" string in  "Built: R 1.5.1;  Win32;  2002-11-11 10:44:35"
with something else for the *.tar.gz package.
What should this something be for "unix" systems? Would this be an ok
approach?

Thank you!

Moderator / list boss:  should this be taken off list? I am interested 
in the current thinking on this issue (of the acceptability of 
methodological questions), since I myself recently posted a 
statistical/methodological question. imho, a certain amount of this 
sort of posting is a "good thing" - it enlivens the list, and 
implementation and theoretical matters are often intertwined - but 
then I have to declare an interest .. I'd like to be able to post 
interesting or challenging problems<g>. So, perhaps some general 
guidance as to the admissibility of such enquiries could be (re) 
posted. 

re Ben Liblit's problem :

I don't quite understand how you get 30,000 variables out of 10,000 
code instrumentation points but no matter... 10K, 30K all the same 
difference.

You have a simple 0/1 dependent variable (runs OK, crashes) 
which has a mean of about 0.2. That's OK .. it means that the 
crash is not such a rare event that you need to consider differential 
subsampling, not immediately anyway. 

Why you would want to fit an "additive" model in this context is 
beyond me .. do you believe that x variable contributes something 
and z variable something else and that if you add those effects 
together you are likely to get a better prediction (of a crash)?. I 
can't imagine it. 

Consider a simple circuit in which there are several switches along 
several paths and a lamp which either glows or it does not 
(success or failure). You MIGHT be able to build a model that 
implies that switch X contributes a certain amount to 
"glowingness",  that MIGHT fit the data OK, but other than as a 
guide to further exploration the model is not much use.

Surely most crashes have a single cause (or perhaps a chain of 
causes - some interaction effects), or there is a multiplicity of 
disparate causes. If your focus is on fault isolation - and assuming 
you only have this post hoc dataset to work with, rather than having 
control over the process - then fitting additive models does not 
imho make a lot of sense.

So why not "screen" your predictors for "significance" in the first 
instance?. This is essentially what recursive partitioning 
procedures do .. look at rpart. Use a simple t test or some such 
and throw out all those that appear to have no influence .. if you 
end up with more than a handful of variables after this weeding out 
stage then I suggest that you either have a very buggy program or 
the process is inherently too complex to analyze. Worried about 
throwing out interaction effects if you throw out all variables that 
appear non-influential at the first cut? Don't be. The likelihood of an 
interaction effect being substantive when the main effects are non 
substantive is quite small.

Your problem is linearly separable, and you are seeing the Hauck-Donner
effect.  This is rare (but by no means unknown) in real problems, and
means the Wald test as used by the t values is unreliable.

More details in Venables & Ripley (1999, 2002), look Hauck-Donner up in
the index.  It's a technical point and the explanation is technical, but
there is also a practical summary there.

I had the same concern, which is why my first posting tried to avoid 
giving many details about the analysis itself and focused instead on R 
usage questions.  But I guess the prospect of 30K variables got folks' 
attention, mostly of the "why in the world are you doing that" variety. 
  My methodology was so clearly absurd that many list members couldn't 
resist getting involved.  :-)

Your question is well put.  Certainly my system is more of a 
single-unknown-cause scenario, rather than multiple-contributing-causes. 
  The *more* bad things you do, the more *likely* you are to crash, but 
ultimately it's only one of those bad things that kills you in any given 
run.

I have to plead ignorance here.  I set out after a logistic regression 
because that's what the statisticians I consulted told me to use.  I 
wish I knew enough to be a more critical consumer of such advice.  But 
I'm a compiler guy, not a statistician, and as such I may be too easily 
led astray in this domain.

Others on this list have offered similar advice, and I am presently 
working on implementing precisely this approach.  Thank you for echoing 
this advice, and even more so for posing questions to challenge my 
assumptions and thereby educate me in the best Socratic tradition.

Hello,

Age	weight

Only 15 rows in total. Weight is the mean weight at birth. I used Tukey's
running median smoother, 'smooth' in the eda package, to smooth the data --
there are very few observation at young ages.
Two questions.
1. Is there another (better?) function to smooth such data?  Am I safe using
'smooth'?
2. How best to extrapolate these data -- to additional 5 data points?  In a
previous email, Doug Bates suggested using interSpline but this seems to require
a predictor. Am I wrong?
TIA for your help

Subject: [R] repeating a dataframe n times in the direction of the rows
Message-ID: <20021111113208.A1769@s1x.zimnet.ch>

Question:
    How can a repeat a dataframe n times 
    in the direction of the rows?
    (Or: How I can rbind a dataframe n times ?)


Example Data:
    x <- data.frame( alpha=letters[1:3], num=1:3 )
    n <- 4


Complicated solution: To rbind a dataframe n times I can program a loop:

    xr <- x
    for( i in 2:n ) xr <- rbind( xr, n )


Observation: To cbind a dataframe n times I can use rep:

    xc <- data.frame( rep( x, n ) )


Is there a similar possibility to repeat in the direction of the rows?

Subject: [R] AOV and general formula sintax 
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20021111114614.00a82390@tus001.unitus.it>

As an agronomist, sometimes i need to perform statistical analisys on 
"weird" field data, like 3 or 4 level split plot design.

I've read both the help of the program, some books and manual about S and 
"Venables/Ripley, Modern Applied Statistics with S", but i still have 
problems in (i suppose) formulae sintax.

I'm trying to perform AOV, as explained in "Random and Mixed Effects", 
chapter 10, V./R., on a data set i collected on turf root density under 
different turf species, substrates, fertilisation and sampling 
depht.  ..and 12 replicates
So, on a general formulation, i have a response factor, say, Roots, 
treatmens T1, T2, T3 and T4, and Rep replicates, organized on a four levels 
split plot design.
I have an old gwbasic program, simple and time tested, that can calculate 
the analisys of variance of 3 levels split plot experiment, and when i 
compare his output whit the results obtained with R, i find that i 
(probably) fail to define the nesting effect of the split plot design.

Can anyone suggest me how to specify the response and error term in the aov 
formula?

Thank in advance

How about

x[rep(1:nrow(x),n),]

One good reason is line endings for information files, which need to be
different on Windows, Mac and Unix.

Your package should be able to be *installed* anywhere, so why don't
you do that?  Build a source package (like all those on CRAN) and test is
with Rcmd check on Windows.

DESCRIPTION files in source packages should not have that line at all.

You can use 't' to transpose your data.frame then you do what you said
by 'cbind' and at last you transpose again.

Best!

Hi dear R-list.
I would superimpose many lines of class 'table' over a plot(table.0,type
="l",...),
I tried 'lines(table.n,type="l",..)' but its behaviour is quite different
from those
of  'plot' :
>plot(table,type="l"...)     # start graph from x = 0
>lines(table,type="l"...)   # start graph from x = 1
Some sugestions? Thanks in advance!

This is generic brain-damage caused by assuming that file extensions
uniquely determine the content (same effect as assuming that
README.DOC files are all in MS Word format). There's an audio format
also called RPM (a version of RealAudio, it seems).

Normally, there's a way to tell your browser to download links instead
of displaying them, thus bypassing any plugin "requirement". In
Mozilla it's Shift-Button-1.

This turns out not to be the case.  It only works if all your variables
are of the same type.

thanks, I'll remember that. FWIW, I got around this problem using
wget. 

I do get an error installing the rpm tho:

Subject: [R] R 1.6.1: help with debugging error in RunGenCollect(), R_gc_internal
Message-ID: <15823.62573.960180.924177@mosaics.wustl.edu>

Hi,

[System info: R 1.6.1 compiled from source (no args to configure) on
Redhat 7.1 Linux i/386]

I have some spatial statistics programs that recently (since R 1.6.1)
have generated SIGSEGV.  These R programs use the splancs library as
well as some C code of my own for Voronoi analysis.

The program has a big loop to fit various model parameters against a
spatial distribution of biological cells.  At some point, varying from
run to run, it generates the Segmentation fault:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

    at ../sysdeps/generic/libc-start.c:129

I'm sorry that I cannot report a consise example here that reproduces
the bug, but I am working on that.  My question for now is there a way
to find out what R command was being executed when the program
errored?

I tried running a recent unstable version of R (1.7.0, 2002-11-08),
and this time didn't get the SIGSEGV.  The only relevant NEWS item in
1.7.0 seems to be:

    o   The code underlying polygon drawing contained a memory leak.
	This showed up in persp, but did not affect other graphics
	functions.  It is now possible to draw big DEMs.


However, I think that is not the cause of this problem, I'm not using
persp in my code.  Also, the R process seems stable at about 30Mb.

Also, are ChangeLogs available for the unstable branch of R, or is it
just the NEWS file?

Any pointers to debugging this appreciated.

best wishes,
Stephen Eglen

Hi,

Is there a direct way of listing objects loaded by load() command? I worked
around by loading into a new environment and then ls() of that environment,
but I wonder if there is a simpler way.

Thanks, Vadim

Hey, 
I have a set of data and want to use Bootstrap
method to estimate some pararameters.

So does anybody know if there are such
functions in R to achieve this?

Thanks for your points.

Are there any R function or packages that generate wind roses?  These are 
``star''-like plots that summarize the frequency, direction and magnigude 
of windspeeds.

Hi Chis,
I am a medical epidemiologist and I am interested in learning to
model multi-processes with Markov chains.

What book references do you recommend?

I notice that expressions can be used in legends, but as far as I can
tell, cannot be used as levels for factors.  I'd like to be able to do
something like that so that the levels printed in a lattice plot show
the degree character.

In Splus, I used to use element [203] (if I remember correctly) of a
vector called All.ASCII which could be pasted with text to produce the
effect I require.


What is a good way to achieve the same in R?

Not easily.  You could try running the profiler and looking at the last
entries in its output file (I don't know how reliable this is)

Also, the error is quite likely caused by something earlier in the
program.

There's a log of recent CVS entries linked from developer.r-project.org.

Subject: [R] library() - Error: Package foo was built for Win32
In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0211111142450.24275-100000@gannet.stats>
Message-ID: <000201c289f4$3016eeb0$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

Thanks. I've got some other off-line comments about distributing a
source package instead. The reason for not doing this is that I wanted
to make life as simple as possible for people using my packages. For
instance, I can not rely on the fact that Windows users all have perl
etc installed, which is is required for an installation from source (I
believe this is why there is the option to create binary
packages/bundles for Windows (Rcmd build --binary) in the first place.
What you and others imply(?) is that it is quite certain that
(non-advanced computer) users on other operating systems than Windows,
i.e. Unix clones (Linux, Solaris, OSX) and MacOS. If this is correct, I
will from now on do

 1) 'Rcmd build --binary foo' to build a *binary* package/bundle for
Windows (*.zip)
 2) 'Rcmd build foo' to build a *source* package/bundle for everything
else (*.tar.gz)

(I do check my package with 'Rcmd check'). My guess and concern is that
some MacOS users might have problem installing from source. Also, is it
correct that a *.zip file should be assumed to be a *binary Windows*
package/bundle and any *tar.gz file should be assumed to be a *source*
package/bundle and never a *binary* distribution?

BTW: Jari Oksanen kindly replied to me that replacing "Win32" with "-"
in the Built: line of (the binary) DESCRIPTION file would indeed prevent
library() to report the error "Error: Package foo was built for Win32"
and a pure R library would load fine on a Unix system too. However, this
solution is very ad hoc and is probably not in line with the purpose of
the test. (I've already noticed the problem with line-endings and I
assert that any "\r" characters are removed from DESCRIPTION).

Thanks again.

Try something like

xyplot(rnorm(100) ~ rnorm(100) | gl(2, 50),
       strip = function(factor.levels, ...) {
           strip.default(factor.levels = expression(1 * degree, 2 * degree),
                         ...)
       })

Dear Chris,
I am afraid that Maximum Likelihood will fail for some condition
(inconsistencies of ML), e.g. with nuisance parameters, then, do you
have any other method(s) beside ML?

Subject:	New package: msm for multi-state models


Dear R users,

A new package "msm", for multi-state modelling, is now available on
CRAN.  
It can be used to fit continuous-time Markov models to
irregularly-observed
categorical processes.  These models are typically used for the 
progression of
chronic diseases, where a patient visits a doctor at irregular intervals

and is
diagnosed as being in one of a set of disease stages. The transition
rates
of the Markov process can be modelled as a function of covariates, and 
the models
are estimated by maximum likelihood.

The software can also fit a form of hidden Markov model: a multi-state
model in which the stages are observed with misclassification.  These 
might be
used in cases where a disease screening test is subject to false 
positives or negatives.
The probabilities of misclassification and the Markov chain transition 
rates can then
be estimated simultaneously, by maximum likelihood.  Covariates can be 
fitted to
both the transition rates and the misclassification probabilities.

Bug reports, reports of successes or failures, and suggestions for 
improvement are
welcome. We would also be interested to hear what applications people 
might be
interested in using this package for.

No. An object doesn't know whether it has been load() or not.

Maybe rose.diag() in package CircStats helps.

Subject: [R] is r-help-digest working?
Message-ID: <3DD0BBF2.FB433673@ceam.es>

Dear all,
I'm a subscriber of the r-help-Digest; however, currently I'm not
receiving the daily message. The 2 last digest messages I've got are: V3
# 157 (2/11/02) and V3 #165 (12/11/02), and both are incomplete (the
initial indice list many items but only few are of them are shown). I
did resuscribe, but the problem persists.

Is this just my problem (a problem of my system)?
Or is it a general problem?
thanks

Juli

it is working very fine.

    juli> Is this just my problem (a problem of my system)? 

Yes, your e-mail software is producing error messages (to me, as list
maintainer quite often). I'll forward the report next time I get
one for you.

There are other people who's e-mail software rejects R-help (or
*-digest) message quite often.
Some, e.g., refuse to transport non-ASCII characters, i.e.
they will refuse everything with accents or umlauts -- a very
silly setup, IMO.

Let me use this occasion to announce that I plan to move the
(remaining) R mailing lists, R-help, R-announce, and R-devel 
with their digests from majordomo to mailman (software wise),
since I now have learned how to use procmail and spamassassin
for spam protection of mailman lists.

This will hopefully have quite a few advantages for you as
subscribers, e.g., it will be simple to change a subscription
from `regular' to `digest' and some digest readers will be happy
to choose MIME-digests instead of the current style.
For me, there's hopefully even more advantages in sofar as
mailman does many things more automatically than majordomo does
now.

Thanks for your help, and to everybody who replied to my message. It was
a bad download. For the record, I am using Win98.

Sort of.  It's the etc that is the problem, not Perl.

They might, but then they might also have trouble unzipping files, and
(see later) it is not clear that files from a Windows install always
work.

No.  One can never assume what a user will do, and R CMD build will build
binary distributions as .tar.gz files on Unix.

Not necessarily: that relies on the system name containing -.  As from
R-devel, an empty platform name will succeed.

But that's not the problem.  A Windows build will generate html files with
CRLF line endings, a Unix one with LF line endings and a classic MacOS one
with CR line endings (I believe).  There is no guarantee that the browser
on another platform will read files with foreign line endings.  R itself
will (as far as we know) as a determined effort was made around version
1.2.0 to ensure this.

There are often also problems with installed documentation.

R uses iso-8859-1 (aka "iso-latin1") per default.
Hence the following works ``automatically''

  > f4 <- gl(4, 3, labels = paste(10*(0:3),"?", sep=""))
  > f4
   [1] 0?  0?  0?  10? 10? 10? 20? 20? 20? 30? 30? 30?
  Levels: 0? 10? 20? 30?

Now, how do you enter the `?' character ?
I use Emacs and the sequence
`C-x 8 * o' 

(In Emacs, type  `` C-x 8 C-h ''  to get a list of all
 ``international characters'' you can get with C-x 8 prefixes.
 Locally we also use "A-" ("Alt" != Meta) key for entering
 things like these; for us particularly the ?????? .. are simple
 Alt-key strokes)

The All.ASCII[] vector you found in S-plus actually comes from
Statlib/S-news and was contributed by myself about 10 years ago.
Here is one way to define it  {not the shortest at all, but
easiest to understand} :

All.ASCII <-

Dear R-developers and users.
Today, I upgraded from R 1.6.0 to 1.6.1
Next, I wanted to install the packages I commonly use....

Then I couldn't find the "ts" package for time series analysis.
Is there a temporary problem with this package, or, has it been included in another package ?

Subject: [R] Preferable contrasts?
Message-ID: <89466355CEFE7244AC3A013E45641C189495B7@lsmail2.crn.nestrd.ch>

Dear experts,

I would like to thank the experts for the fast and fruitful advises 
concerning my posted problem. Some would like to know 
where contr.SAS comes from. It is part of the NLME library 
and it could be found in the SASmixed library. 
However, I think it's not crucial where it comes from 
to present my problem. My problem was more of general nature 
about the impact of contrasts to the p-value of parameter estimates 
than to this special case of contr.SAS. I'm aware that there is some 
impact but it was surprising for me that I could choose whether PRO 
is significant or PRE is significant depending on contrasts. 
Now I would like to summarize the answers.

Vito Muggio recommends using Likelihood Ratio Test instead.
> 1-pchisq(2*pro.pre$loglik[2]-2*pre$loglik[2], df=1) # impact of pro
[1] 0.1962388
> 1-pchisq(2*pro.pre$loglik[2]-2*pro$loglik[2], df=1) # impact of pre
[1] 0.1259392
PRO and PRE seems not to contribute in a significant way.
 
Brian Ripley advice that the interpretation of main effects in the presence
of interactions depends on the coding except for a few special cases
(least squares fitting, balance and true contrasts (e.g. not
contr.treatment nor contr.SAS) spring to mind).  One extreme
view is never to look at the coefficients, only at predictions, and
although a counsel of perfection it contains a lot of merit.
In addition, he refers to chapter 6 of MASS. 

John Fox writes that parameter estimates should interpret in 
conformity with the coding employed. 
When using 0/1 coding in a model with interactions, you 
shouldn't think of the coefficients for factor(PRO) and factor(PRE) as 
"main effects." 

Frank E. Harrell Jr. also recommend to predict values and 
pointed me to an example of his contrast.Design, part of the Design library.
> contrast(f, list(PRO=1,PRE=0),list(PRO=0, PRE=0))
 PRE  Contrast      S.E.      Lower    Upper    Z Pr(>|z|)
   0 0.6576294 0.3020151 0.06569076 1.249568 2.18   0.0294
> contrast(f, list(PRO=0,PRE=1),list(PRO=0, PRE=0))
 PRO  Contrast      S.E.      Lower     Upper    Z Pr(>|z|)
   0 0.0680866 0.3040376 -0.5278161 0.6639893 0.22   0.8228
Rising PRO by 1 seems to be a significant effect, PRE not.

In summary, all experts point me to use something, 
which is independent of a certain contrast matrix. 
Personally, I would like to prefer the prediction 
rather than the LR-test, because I have really to spell out 
what I want to see.

Thank you all,

Dominik

Message-ID: <3DD0EF1A.7070202@perseus.unalmed.edu.co>

Dear R-List:
I was experimenting with ATLAS to compile Rblas.dll again.
My processor is a PIII (x86 Family 6 Model 8 Stepping) in W2K.
I compile R from the sources with all the recommended tools, no problem.
I remake Rblas.dll from sources with cygwin.
When I use the CRAN compiled version (rw1061.exe) its performance (I use 
kriging function
on GeoR)  is very similar to the one I compiled.
I then recompile my version using the Rblas I built, now the performance 
was down in
relation with the CRAN compiled version. I experiment also with the CRAN 
/ATLAS Rblas.dll
precompiled version.
But the thing that I don't understand is that if I use the Rblas.dll 
form the CRAN version (the one in
the rw1061.exe version) on my compiled version, it is faster!!! than the 
CRAN version and
of course my compiled version both with and without the Rblas recompiled.
I wonder ... why?
I would like to know more about your own experiences in this issue.

Thank you very much!
Kenneth Cabrera

Subject: [R] problem with `legend' + `substitute'
Message-ID: <20021112122248.GA18254@pcf004.jinr.ru>

Hello, R experts!

I'd like to add the somewhat complicated expression as "legend"
to the plot:

  x  <-  1
  T  <- 10

  plot(x)
  legend   ( 1.0 ,1.0
            ,substitute ( paste ( Sr["2"] ,GaMnO["5.541"]
                                 ,", T = " ,T ,"K"
                                )
                         ,list (T = T)
                        )
            ,bg = "white"
            ,xjust = 0.5
            ,yjust = 0.5
           )

So, I get plot with not one, but *six* instances of the desired expression,
one under another!

Ok, trying to use `text' ..

  plot(x)
  text     ( 1.0 ,1.0
            ,substitute ( paste ( Sr["2"] ,GaMnO["5.541"]
                                 ,", T = " ,T ,"K"
                                )
                         ,list (T = T)
                        )
            ,adj = c(0.5, 0.5)
           )

Well, `text' works properly!  but why `legend' behaves so?


(I'm running R v1.6.1 on Debian woody system for i386)

Thanks,
Timur.

Message-ID: <FB75CFC167F3D311B11D00A0CC20FB0E614B8B@nts7.oec.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE>


Dear R-List:

I`m trying to calculate the probabilities for a bivariate normal
distribution while using the mvtnorm-package(dmvnorm) and the
adapt-package for multidimensional integration.

The problem is that I can`t specify the upper bound in the adapt-package
the way I need it because I don`t need a rectangular area. I want to
calculate the probability starting at the origin under the line y=x.  

In MATHEMATICA it`s possible to use 
NIntegrate[pdf, {x, 0, 5}, {y, 0, x}]  with pdf as bivariate
normal distribution but it`s very slow. 

Can anybody help me to do it in R ??

Thanks in advance

S?nke Iwersen

Subject: [R] Treemaps
Message-ID: <15825.7870.861910.952667@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Has anyone implemented "treemaps" in R?

A "treemap" is a visual display of a tree structure in which, at each level,
the several nodes are represented by rectangles which fill the available area.
The areas of the rectangles represent size, and their colors represent some
other variable.  There are several algorithms for deciding how to place the
rectangles, ref:
            <http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemaps/>
You might use a treemap to show how your disk space is allocated, how the stock
market is doing by sector, or how Usenet traffic is distributed.

Thanks!

I don't want particularly to single out this question, but it illustrates
a general point that might be helpful to other people on the list.

The reason that we want to know the location of contr.SAS is to be able to
see what it does.  Except for very simple questions like "What this the
name of the help command?" most of us need to try an example to work out
the answer.

This is particularly important for bug reports -- a bug report that is
reproducible is usually easy to track down and fix, one that isn't
reproducible is almost always hard to fix.   There's a very nice article
about this at
  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html


Sometimes it isn't possible for us to try an example related to your
question -- it might require your data or your computer or  your large and
complicated files or something -- but if we can, it sure helps.

Wrong compiler, if you really used cygwin.

On small problems very small changes in the compiler or the problem can
affect the speed comparisons.  With large problems ATLAS wins hands down.

Very few things people do with R are actaully affected significantly by
the BLAS speed.

Subject: [R] R: Error in plot.new() : axis style "d" not implemented
Message-ID: <014901c28a6e$759e4ee0$284b128b@hb>

Hi there!

Both on windows and Solaris platforms I run into troubles when trying to
draw two plots on top of each other. Here a short code example:

> x1 <- c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
> y1 <- sin(x1)
> x2 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
> y2 <- cos(x2)
> d1 <- cbind(x1,y1)
> d2 <- cbind(x2,y2)
> plot(d1)
> par(new=T, xaxs="d")
> plot(d2)
Error in plot.new() : axis style "d" unimplemented
> 


And here an excerpt from the R help pages: 
xaxs
The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the x-axis.
Possible values are "r", "i", "e", "s", "d". The styles are generally
controlled by the range of data or xlim, if given. Style "r" (regular)
first extends the data range by 4 percent and then finds an axis with
pretty labels that fits within the range. Style "i" (internal) just
finds an axis with pretty labels that fits within the original data
range. Style "s" (standard) finds an axis with pretty labels within
which the original data range fits. Style "e" (extended) is like style
"s", except that it is also ensured that there is room for plotting
symbols within the bounding box. Style "d" (direct) specifies that the
current axis should be used on subsequent plots. (Only "r" and "i"
styles are currently implemented) 

As I understand the manual pages, this should work. However it doesn't. 

Is there any other way to combine plots and align them on the same axis?
I hope someone can help.

Cheers,
Hinnerk

Subject: [R] trouble positioning legends on barplot written to a file
Message-ID: <JFEDJKCABKCOMJDIIFPJOEBKCGAA.tarnold@smpllc.com>

I'm trying to generate some plots for print publication and I'm having trouble
getting them the way I want. I get a plot with a legend that overlaps the bars
and looks bad. Also, I'm saving this as PDF file (whatever happened to the
"png" function to save as PNG format, in r 1.4.1?)

I've tried a number of things, which produce a number of questions.

1) it seems that the "legend" for a plot must be within the plot area. Is
there a way to put the legend above, below, or to the side of the plot? The
particular data I have fill up the plotting area (stacked bar charts, going to
100% in each bar)

2) I've tried using "locator()" to position the legend. This only works, so
far, if I am not using trying to divert output to another device -- like
creating a PDF via
pdf();
barplot(resultmat);
dev.off();

so if I take out the pdf() and the dev.off() and just do this:
barplot(resultmat);
legend(locator(1),legend=l,fill=colors);

it works, on the graphics display device window on screen.

However, if I do this:
pdf(onefile=FALSE);
barplot(resultmat);
legend(locator(1),legend=l,fill=colors);
dev.off();

I get:
>Error in legend(locator(1),legend = l : missing y

Also it doesn't let me specify a point. I suppose that's not so surprising,
because it is drawing to a non-interactive graphics device (the PDF "device"
is non-interactive, right?), but the error message is confusing.

So, is there any way to specify the location with locator() AND to save that
plot to a file?

And if I don't use "locator' then I have to specify the legend location to
"legend(x,y, legend) but the documentation doesn't say what coordinate system
that's supposed to be in.

TIA.

Im using cygwin for ATLAS because the windows.txt on /doc says:
"You will want to download the "full" version of cygwin, which
includes compilers, shells, make, etc.  If you need fortran, that must be
downloaded separately"

I try to use MinGW to compile ATLAS, but when it try to execute
xconfig.exe it freezes, both with the MSYS environment and without.

Maybe I am doing something wrong trying to compile ATLAS on MinGW, but
I don't know what. Please help.

> With large problems ATLAS wins hands down.

Do you mean the ATLAS will not do a good job?

The structure of your S expression is the point:

  temp <- substitute(paste(Sr["2"], GaMnO["5.541"], 
            ", T = ", T, "K"), list (T = T))
  length(temp)   # ah! 6!
  str(temp)      # that's it! Try also:
  temp[[1]]
  temp[[2]]      # ...

Because it plots one line per element of your S expression, which
consists of 6!

What you can do is:

 x  <-  1
 Te  <- 10
 # substitute at first:
 temp <- substitute(paste(Sr["2"] * GaMnO["5.541"], ",", 
     T == Te * K), list(Te = Te))
 plot(x)
 # and construct a single expression (length = 1) by using do.call():
 legend(1, 1, do.call("expression", list(temp)), 
     bg = "white", xjust = 0.5, yjust = 0.5)

Which part of 'Only "r" and "i"' did you misunderstand if you expect
"d" to work?

If you rotate the axes by 45 degrees it becomes a rectangle. Even better,
it is a half-plane and you can just use pnorm().

Hi

It is possible to draw the legend outside the plot, but it is
inconvenient because the location is specified in terms of the scales on
the x- and y-axes.  Positioning therefore becomes a matter of trial and
error.  In the example below, I create space for the legend using
par(oma) [again the size of the margin is a matter of guess work] and
make sure that the legend is not clipped out of existence by specifying
par(xpd=NA) ...

   # generate some dummy data that sums to 100 in each col

You might have other colours you would prefer to use :)

Please read the last sentence you cited --- right, the one in brackets!
It means: "d" is NOT implemented.

Try points(x2, y2) instead of the second call to plot().
Maybe you need to scale the axes in the first call to plot(), or e.g.
like:

 plot(c(x1, x2), c(y1, y2), type = "n")
 points(x1, y1)
 points(x2, y2)

That's very simple.  Deepayan Sarkar's method of using expression (and 
which I asked about) is relatively complicated.  Since I use ESS, the 
simple way is best.  It's even easier than the All.ASCII method.

Thanks.

Thanks also for that elucidation.

Thanks for that answer.  Martin's answer which was not so directly related
to my question, nevertheless was even more useful.  The expression approach
is more difficult to make generic for varying length of factor levels.  For
people who don't use Emacs, it's a good approach.

Nothing: it is still there on the systems that have ever had it, Windows
and Unix-alikes with an X11 display.  What's your problem in finding it?
What does ?png give on your system?

Look up the xpd par argument to plot outside the plot region (but still in
the figure region).

It's you who confused it.  Print the result of locator(1) and look up
?legend and you will see why you get the message.  If you call a function
with incorrect arguments, why don't you expect an error message telling
you so?

Yes, via dev.copy and friends.

There is only one coordinate system, that set by the plot() command.
*None* of the R graphics commands tell you the coordinate system to be
used precisely because there is only one at a time.

There *is* are example on the help page for legend.

??? pdf() produces PDFs, png() portable network graphics, etc. .... I
don't get the point.
BTW: R-1.4.1 is rather old.

Use 
 par(xpd = TRUE)
before legend(), see ?par for details.

I wouldn't expect locator() to work that way at all ...

> plot to a file?

Yes. plot() to the windows() or x11() device, use locator() and "copy"
the plot to another device.
Look particularly at 
 ?dev.copy, ?dev.print, and ?dev.copy2eps(...)
I don't recommend this way.

Use par("usr") (after barplot()) to get some interesting information.
Thgis can be combined with par(xpd = TRUE), which was mentioned above:

 pdf(onefile = FALSE)
 barplot(resultmat)
 # get "extremes of the user coordinates of the plotting region." 
 par("usr")     
 # "plotting clipped to figure region"  
 par(xpd = TRUE)
 # now a proper legend()
 dev.off()

You might consider putting the legend in a separate plot area.  For
instance, using the layout function:

library(grid)
data(VADeaths, package = "base")
layout( cbind(1,2), widths=c(8,3) )  # make two plotting areas, 
                                     #   8 and 3 units wide
barplot(VADeaths, plot = TRUE)       # generate the barplot
plot.new()                           # move to the new region
legend(x=0.5,y=0.5,letters[1:5],     # center a legend in the new
       fill=heat.colors(5)[1:5],     #   plot region
       xjust=0.5,yjust=0.5)

Message-ID: <JFEDJKCABKCOMJDIIFPJEEBMCGAA.tarnold@smpllc.com>

Thanks to all who replied with suggestions about using par(xpd=TRUE), using
dev.copy, and using a separate plot area for the legend. These are all good
and with the first response I got enough information to get a satisfactory
solution -- I haven't tried them all yet.

Another question in my post confused the issue. I mentioned that I'm using
pdf() and asked what happened to the png() function. Let me try to clarify:
- I want to produce a separate file for inclusion in web or print documents.
- In the past I've used the png() function, on Windows to create a file for
use on a web page
- I work alternately on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (A FreeBSD
derivative)
- I'm working on Mac OS 9.1 at the moment.

I grabbed some old files I'd created with subroutines in R that I used on R
1.4.1 on Windows. I opened them on my Mac and tried to run them in R 1.6.1 and
found that png() does not exist. I didn't think to go back to the Windows
platform and try it, and I guessed that for some reason png had disappeared --
much the same as GIF disappeared from some open source packages like GD a few
years ago because of the Unisys patent claim on LZW compression. Of course I
had no data for this, it was a guess. It didn't occur to me that a call to
produce "portable network graphics" would appear only on certain computing
platforms, [mild irony] and I saw no mention of it in the documentation.

So I looked around and found the pdf() call and started using that. For print
documents, it will probably work better anyway. Of course the formats were
created for different needs; that was not my question. I just was surprised
that png() seemed to have "disappeared" from my Mac version of R, when in fact
I guess it never existed in that version anyway.

Got that?

Subject: [R] using list to pass argument to function
Message-ID: <b0.2f735406.2b030ca9@aol.com>

Hi,

I am trying to apply *sapply* to functions within functions within functions 
to do a Monte Carlo experiment: take Y sample of size X based on cell 
probabilities (using Brian Ripley's suggestion for drawing from contingency 
tables), for each calculate a vector of statistics, calculate bootstrap std 
errs with R replications and their means and SD. Store results in a matrix 
for further use. The problem is how to pass 3 arguments returned as c() by a 
fucntion to another  function that uses them using: sapply(rep(c(), R), 
anotherfucntion). This does not seem to work, possibly because I am passing a 
c() argument where 3 separate arguemnts are needed. What is a good way to do 
this? I am trying to avoid *for* loops.

Anupam.

I think part of the problem is that the font used on the X11 device is
Helvetica and the default font for Windows is Arial.  The default point
size is 12 in both cases, but just because two fonts have the same
nominal point size does not mean that they physically are the same size.
It should theoretically be possible to set yourself up with either
Helvetica on Windows or Arial on Linux, but I don't know of a (free)
source for such fonts.

Subject: [R] How call method of root "class" directly?
Message-ID: <000201c28ad7$b004c6e0$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

Is there a way of calling the method of the root class directly? Here is
an example explaing my question. Everything relates to S3/UseMethod
classes and methods. I have an object x of class MicroarrayMatrix, which
inherits from class Matrix. The "core" object of x is a simple matrix.
In other words, I basically have

  x <- matrix(logratios, ncol=nbrOfSpots, nrow=nbrOfSlides)
  class(x) <- c("MicroarrayMatrix", "Matrix")

Both these classes implement their own version of the "["() method. The
"["() method of MicroarrayMatrix will return (spot, slide) values if
called with two indices. Example:
 
  x[spots, slides]

This is exactly the same as calling unclass(x)[spots, slides]. If one
uses three indices the (gene, replicate, slide) values according to a
spot -> (gene, replicate) map will be returned. Example:

  x[gene, replicate, slides]

This overloading of "["() is really useful in some situations, but
painfully slow in other situations. For instance, trying to do (dummy
example but it explains my problem):

  sumOfMeans <- 0
  for (row in seq(length=nrow(x)))
    sumOfMeans <- sumOfMeans + mean(x[row,])

Since x is of class MicroarrayMatrix, there will be some overhead costs
because first "["() will be called, which calls "[.MicroarrayMatrix"(),
which then calls "[.Matrix"(), which finally calls the built in "["()
function. Is there a way of calling this built in function directly? It
would speed up the calculations quite a bit. The only way I know of is
to first unclass() the object. Example:

  xCopy <- unclass(x)
  sumOfMeans <- 0
  for (row in seq(length=nrow(x)))
    sumOfMeans <- sumOfMeans + mean(xCopy[row,])

However, doing unclass() on a huge matrix also takes a while and that
approach also requires twice the memory because xCopy is a copy of x
(which I guess is the reason why unclass() takes time). I have been
trying to come up with a way of fooling NextMethod() to call the built
in function, but I can't see how to do this (without removing the "["()
methods). Also, remember that "["() is defined as .Primitive("["), so
there is no way to reach the "default" function.

Related to this topic is of course how I chose to represent the Matrix
object in the first place. I could do

  x <- list(core=matrix(logratios, ncol=nbrOfSpots, nrow=nbrOfSlides))
  class(x) <- c("MicroarrayMatrix", "Matrix")

instead and be able access the "pure" matrix by x$core. However, there
are pros and cons with this design too.

I appreciate any help or suggestions.

Best wishes 

Henrik Bengtsson

Well, if he has Windows on his computer, it should be easy (and
probably even legal) to use TT fonts from the Windows mount in
Linux.

Would you like to contribute a png() device for MacOS?

The thing is, kind users of Windows and of Unix/X11 did contribute one for
each. Perhaps you now appreciate their efforts?

A quick fix is to use the `pointsize' argument of the devices you use.

Subject: [R] using list to pass argument to function
In-Reply-To: <b0.2f735406.2b030ca9@aol.com>
Message-ID: <000001c28af2$de47c780$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

The problem is that c() is of length zero and repeating such a vector R
times will only give you a vector of length zero, e.g. length(rep(c(),
R)) == 0. I think you have observed this already. The only way to store
a repetition of empty vectors or NULL values is by using the data type
list, e.g.

  args <- rep(list(c()), R)

Then sapply(args, FUN=anotherfunction) will work, but I think you are
better of with

  lapply(args, FUN=anotherfunction) 

I am not sure if you wrote the function that returns c() or not. If not,
you can always convert a vector to a list and then make sure it has the
right length, i.e. R, by doing:

  if (length(vec) == 0)
    args <- rep(list(vec), length.out=R)
  else
    args <- rep(as.list(vec), length.out=R)

Warning, only using as.list() won't work if length(vec) == 0, but if you
know that it is not a list that is returned, which I guess you know, all
you have to do is:

    args <- rep(list(vec), length.out=R)

Finally, if R is not way too big I actually think a for loop would be
equally fast if that is your concern. Someone correct me if I am wrong,
but for loops are not penalized that much in R as for instance in
Matlab.

Cheers

Henrik Bengtsson

Subject: [R] DLLs adding in C++ code
Message-ID: <914B18DCA0ADD511ABE000508BF339FB4B6C25@LOWEXPRESS2.corp.cefas.co.uk>

I would like to utilise the power of R by adding my own software as a
package written in C++. As a first step I am trying 
to write a DLL with a simple function that can be called from R. The DLL
contains a C++ routine written and complied in Microsoft Visual C++ Ver 6.0
and is based upon the example in R-Exts

eg I am trying to create the following example function

SEXP out(SEXP x, SEXP y)
   {
   int i, j, nx, ny;
   double tmp;
   SEXP ans;

   nx = length(x); ny = length(y);
   PROTECT(ans = allocMatrix(REALSXP, nx, ny));
   for(i = 0; i < nx; i++) {
    tmp = REAL(x)[i];
    for(j = 0; j < ny; j++)
      REAL(ans)[i + nx*j] = tmp * REAL(y)[j];
   }
   UNPROTECT(1);
   return(ans);
 }

I have used tried to generating a lib file that imports the R functions
using the supplied file (from CRAN)

	lib /def:R.exp /out:Rdll.lib

and even used dumpbin and the suppiled R.dll to construct a DEF file by
hand. However, although I have previously 
sucessfully created DLL functions for SPlus I have been unable to do this
using the supplied R code and binaries. I get the Link time error saying
that the R functions can not be found.

e.g.

error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "void __stdcall Rf_unprotect(int)"
(?Rf_unprotect@@YGXH at Z)
error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _REAL at 4
error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _Rf_protect at 4
error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _Rf_allocMatrix at 12
error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _Rf_length at 4

I suspect this is because of way in which the functions are exported is not
standardised between MS and GNU compilers.

I suppose that I can recompile all the R code in VC++ and then I would be
able to use my simple DLL but this would be a 
major exercise and then I couldn't make my own routines easily available
within R.

Has anybody encountered this problem and know of a solution.

There's some mumblejumble because Microsoft made this stuff available
for free, but only allowed *unmodified* redistribution, so this
package has the original MS package + code to turn it into an RPM.

There is a source for MS TT fonts here:

The primary instructions are for RPM based distros, but there are links
on the page for others.

Subject: [R] Comparing GAM objects using ANOVA
Message-ID: <mnet1.1037196209.28573.Fabien.Fivaz@ie-zea.unil.ch>

Hi,

Is it possible to compare two GAM objects created with the gam() function from the mgcv package. I use a slightly modified version of anova.glm() named anova.gam(), modified from John Fox (2002). It often gives me some aberant responses, especially with "F" test. I use a quasibinomial model and scale (dispersion) is calculated and used in the calculation of the F value. Does someone already tried this or does someone knows if all this is theoretically possible ?

Best wishes,

Fabien Fivaz

Message-ID: <20021113150400.GB1245@komensky.surfbest.net>

Hi,

I have this table (BTW, published by FBI and representing age

	"LABEL" "FREQ" "MIDPOINT"
	"1" "Infant (under 1)"   0
	"2" "1 to 4"   5

	"7" "20 to 24" 117
	"8" "25 to 29" 341
	"9" "30 to 34" 503

Are there any tools to work with grouped frequencies (i.e.,

I have to calculate them ``by hand''?

Thanks for any answer,

There are details of how to do this in readme.packages.  Either you
haven't read it or you haven't understood it?  Which?

Hint: you don't have the right compiler flags, and it looks to me as if
you have non-standard ones at that.  *If* you follow the instructions to
use cdecl linkage you should have less trouble.

BTW, VC++ cannot be use to compile R. Several people have tried but the
code VC++ generates is too buggy to pass the R tests.

Subject: [R] problems with read.ssd in foreign
Message-ID: <3DD27B71.EAB8D64A@yorku.ca>

I'm trying to read in a sas system file (.sas7bdat) created
under SAS 8.2 using read.ssd as follows:

> library(foreign)
> libname <- "c:/sasuser/consult/"
> sascmd <- "c:/Program\ Files/SAS\ Institute/SAS/V8/sas.exe"
> subset <- read.ssd(libname, "subset", sascmd=sascmd)
SAS failed.  SAS program at c:\windows\TEMP\Rtmp6673\file24544.sas 
a log and other error products should be in the vicinity
Warning messages: 
1: c:/Program not found 
2: SAS return code was -1 in: read.ssd(libname, "subset", sascmd =
sascmd) 

sas.exe is not on my path, and I've tried variious ways to
enter the path to sas.exe allowing for the spaces, without success.
Am I missing something?  Is it true that R cannot deal with
path names containing spaces?

I was able to create an xport file from SAS, and read this with

subset<- read.xport("c:/sasuser/consult/subset.xport")

However, I encountered problems in SAS which might need to be
taken into account in read.ssd.  Under SAS V8, variable names
can be up to 32 characters, but the PROC COPY (which is used
in read.ssd will fail, unless the SAS option, validvarname=V6
is used, as in:

libname rd 'c:\sasuser\consult';
libname subset xport "c:\sasuser\consult\subset.xport";
options validvarname=v6;
proc copy in=rd out=subset;
    select subset;
run;

Dear R-masters!

I have a database with 2400 patients and I need make a sample with 90 subjects.
How to I make a random sample in this data base with R?

Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <000001c28b36$1ec99f20$d3d515ac@chiloe>

Hi all,

I've got a basic question regarding package documentation and rd.sty. I
wrote my first own package, and now I would like to place the documentation
into the appendix of another LaTex document. Seemingly I cannot simply
\usepackage{Rd}, as this will modify the page-settings of my document. Is
there a minimum style file which will just define the environments and
commands needed for Rd-files but leaves the page-setup alone?

Thanks for your hints!

Daniel

Hi all. I have something similar to the following:

myinfo <- read.table( file = "myfile.txt", sep = "|", col.name = c( "data1",
"data2" ) )

myfile.txt:
a|1|
b|2|

However, since there are two pipe (|) characters, it reads it in and thinks
there should be three columns. This is not the case and I get a warning
about col.names is wrong length. Is there a way around this? Thanks.

try this

I bumped into just that in connection with the appendix in ISwR. I
butchered the Rd.sty (patch below), but perhaps something more
organized is called for. In particular, I didn't take care to change
the name or add a comment that I hacked it since it was not intended
for redistribution.

Hi Rio,

what is the point where you need support, accessing the database or getting
the random sample? For picking the random samples, something like
"ceiling(runif(1, 0, rows))" might do to get the row-id.

This snipped here loads some rows from a MySQL database (if some R-guru
feels that this snippet is poor/nonsense/... please let me know, eager for
learning more ;-)):

pnbd.cohort.loadFromDatabase <- function(periods, description)
{
  mgr <- dbDriver("MySQL")
  con <- dbConnect(mgr, dbname="clv")
  customerCount <- pnbd.cohort.size(description)
  if (customerCount == 0)
  {
        stop("cohort not found!")
  }
  aggregation <- matrix(0, nrow=periods ,ncol=customerCount)
  for (i in 1:periods)
  {
    rs <- dbSendQuery(con, paste(sep="",
    "select orderCount from pnbd_aggregation where period = ", i, " and
description=\"", description, "\""))
    purchasesPerCustomerFrame <- fetch(rs, n=-1)
    aggregation[i, 1:customerCount] <- purchasesPerCustomerFrame[[1]]
    dbClearResult(rs)
  }
  dbDisconnect(con)

  cohort <- list(aggregation = aggregation, description = description)
  class(cohort) <- "pnbd.cohort"
  cohort
}

The relevant package in this case is DBI and the package supporting your
database, in my case RMySQL, but there are others as well. If memory is not
an issue, you could load all your 2400 records and then pick a sample. If
that's not possible and your records are numbered or your database supports
some kind of row-id concept you could generate the row-ids and then hit the
database once for each row-id (although that might well be slower than
loading all 2400 records with one statement).

Best Regards,

Daniel

You might use scan and its `flush' argument, or simply

 myinfo <- read.table( file = "myfile.txt", sep = "|")[-3]
 names(myinfo) <- c("data1", "data2")

I bumped into just that in connection with the appendix in ISwR. I
butchered the Rd.sty (patch below), but perhaps something more
organized is called for. In particular, I didn't take care to change
the name or add a comment that I hacked it since it was not intended
for redistribution.

I do not think, that it makes any sense to take mean from one
value of every valuable (which is what I do with tapply here,
don't I?).

There _are_ three columns: | is the column _separator_.  So give three
column names and ignore/discard the third column.

Alternatively preprocess the file to remove the incorrect (according to
your description) second separator. On Unix piping though sed will do it,
and there are lots of other ways.

Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021113164143.00b01978@courrier.usherbrooke.ca>

Hello.  the rep(x) function replicates the vector x.  I am looking for a 
quick way of "expanding" a vector.  Here is what I mean by "expand":

given: x<-c(2,5,4)
If I "expand" x three times, then I will get 2,2,2,5,5,5,4,4,4.  In other 
words, I want to keep the original ordering (2,5,4) but duplicate each of 
the original entries three times.

Is there such a function?  If not, can someone suggest a fast way of doing 
this?

Thanks.

Hola!

Suppose your data base is a data.frame:

Hi Bill

rep() works as you want, with the each= argument:


R> rep(c(2,5,4),each=3)
[1] 2 2 2 5 5 5 4 4 4

all the best

It's easier than you think:

> x <- c(2,5,4)
> rep(x,each=3)
[1] 2 2 2 5 5 5 4 4 4

[That one escaped me until recently, too. I used to use
rep(x,rep(3,length(x))).]

Subject: [R] Putting value labels inside the bars of a bar plot
Message-ID: <JFEDJKCABKCOMJDIIFPJKECACGAA.tarnold@smpllc.com>

I'd like to label a bar plot with the actual value of each bar, inside the
bar. I see that there are ways to plot arbitrary text, so I could do it
'manually', but this seems common enough that there's probably a simple
solution. I don't see it in the high-level documentation for barplot, and
haven't found it anywhere yet. How might this be done?

Thanks,

In postgresql, one way to take a random sample is using the random()
function with a limit on the number of rows returned. It is something
like:

    select * from mydb
    order by random()
    limit 100;

Perhaps mysql has a similar RANDOM() function that can be used for
sorting by a random field.

The trick is to know that barplot returns the x-location of the
midpoints of the bars.  Here's a simple example:

	x <- sample(seq(15, 30, 5))
	midpoints <- barplot(x)
	text(midpoints, 3, labels=x)

Try something like:

Adjust second argument to text() to get the labels where you want them.
Look at the "Value" section of the "barplot" help page.

Subject: [R] Putting value labels inside the bars of a bar plot


I'd like to label a bar plot with the actual value of each bar, inside the
bar. I see that there are ways to plot arbitrary text, so I could do it
'manually', but this seems common enough that there's probably a simple
solution. I don't see it in the high-level documentation for barplot, and
haven't found it anywhere yet. How might this be done?

Thanks,
Tom

rep(x, each=) was something from S4 I added to R for 1.5.0 so it has
only been there for 6 months or so.

Just to add my 10 cents here. A solution to this problem is to build a
wrapper, that is a standard dll interface that passes calls from R to the
C++ dll. However, there may be soon a new package (thanks, Tomas Baier and
Erich Neuwirth!) that allows R to act as a COM client, meaning that calls to
COM servers, either in-process (ddls), or out-of-process (exes), and
probably also on different machines (D-COM) will be immediate (no or few
recoding in  C++, direct access in S language).

Best,

For the mean, there is a function called weighted.mean() and you can use it 
as a start for custom functions.

An alternative is to expand your grouped data before applying your 
function, e.a.

 > x <- rep(wtc$MIDPOINT, wtc$FREQ)
 > c(Mean=mean(x), Var=var(x))

but it isn't appropriate for some parameters (it doesn't give interpolated 
median, etc)

Subject: [R] summarizing "alternative to rep"
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021114082115.00aa0be8@courrier.usherbrooke.ca>

Yesterday I asked how to "expand" a vector similar to the rep() function 
but keeping the original order.  For instance, given a vector:
x<-c(3,2,5)
I was looking for some function - call it expand() - such that :
expand(x,3) would return 3,3,3,2,2,2,5,5,5

I received many replies and, as usual in R, there are many different ways 
of doing this.

1. Brian D. Ripley said: rep(x, each=) was something from S4 I added to R 
for 1.5.0 so it has  only been there for 6 months or so.  This is the 
simplest way but I had an older version of R...

2.  rep(c(2,5,4),rep(3,3))  (or more generally: y<-rep(x,rep(length(x),3)) 
) which also works.

3. I found that this works as well: 
as.vector(apply(as.matrix(y),1,function(x){rep(x,n.times)}))

Thanks to all who helped.

Subject: [R] chron and locales
Message-ID: <XFMail.20021114151916.steuer@unibw-hamburg.de>

(R-1.6.0 and chron 2.2, linux)

I have to work with date/time values from another LOCALE
on my machine. My normal locale is "de DE at euro" and 
the data I have to handle use AM/PM specifications for the times.

dstring <- "Nov 12 2001  4:31PM"

The problem now is, that  
strptime(dstring, "%b %d %Y %I:%M%p")
[1] "2001-11-12 04:31:00"

just ignores my times coming from another locale.

I have a workaroud (kind of) in setting my LANG enviroment to C
before starting R, but I hope for a better, more portable solution.
Any hints?

(Your reference is probably to the anova.gam function in the script file 
for the on-line appendix on nonparametric regression to my R and S-PLUS 
Companion to Applied Regression.)

I don't have specific information about your question, but can provide some 
background: Hastie and Tibshirani, Generalized Additive Models (Chapman and 
Hall, 1990), discuss analysis of variance and analysis of deviance 
procedures for GAMs, providing a heuristic justification and some 
simulation evidence. You'll find discussion of the subject on pages 65-67, 
155-156, and 292-294.

I hope that this helps,

Would it be hard to make the X11 device driver in R accept general X11
resources?  In particular I would like to be able to set the title of
the graphics window when I start it up.  (Note this is not the same
thing as the title of a plot but rather is the character string
visible to the window manager, and usually goes in a titlebar on top.)

For example in Splus one can do

  > motif('-xrm "sgraphMotif*title: Hello World"')

Is there a way of doing a similar thing in R?

An object of class `density' has `x' and `y' components, which are what you
need to do the plot.  Just bind them into a matrix and use write() to write
to a file.

Subject: [R] nlm / fscale
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.1.20021114161527.00a19060@labtechno.roazhon.inra.fr>

Dear all,

I am using the nlm(base) function for a simple least squares problem.

The size (order of magnitude) of the minimized function near the final 
parameter set is normally about 1e-10. Using the fscale=1e-10 argument in 
nlm is inefficient (no minimization is performed, iterations=0 or 1). Nlm 
only works when the minimized function is multiplied by 1e10 (without 
changing the default fscale).

Why? How should I use the fscale arg?

Thanks!

Subject: [R] analysis of data with observation weights
Message-ID: <18923864571.20021114172242@poczta.onet.pl>

Dear R-users,

Recently I had to analyze a dataset from household survey. The sample design
ensured, that each household in the population has the same probability of being
sampled. However the data were gathered from only one adult individual in each
household, who was randomly choosen by an interviewer (via "Kish grid"). To
equalize the probabilities for each INDIVIDUAL a casewise weighting factor is
introduced. It is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of adults in the
household and rescaled so it's sum equals the sample size. This weighting factor
is neccessery to perform inferences for population of individuals.

I had no problems with estimating models which use count data, because I could
construct contingency tables with something like:

tapply(weight, a.bunch.of.factors, sum)

Unfortunately I couldn't come up with a good way of building other kinds of
models for those data. Is there some way (apart for writing new functions from
scratch) to perform modelling tasks like lm(), that will take the weights into
account?

(As far as I know there are only basic functions weighted.mean() and cov.wt()
for weighted means and weighted covariance/correlation matrices respectively.)


Thank you in advance for any suggestions.


Michal

?density tells you

Value:

     If `give.Rkern' is true, the number R(K), otherwise an object with
     class `"density"' whose underlying structure is a list containing
     the following components.

       x: the `n' coordinates of the points where the density is
          estimated.

       y: the estimated density values.

...

so you could for example do

dens <- density(...)
write.table(data.frame(x=dens$x, y=dens$y), "somefile")

I have no idea why anyone would want to plot in gnuplot rather than in R,
and hence don't know what formats gnuplot accepts.

Subject: [R] Problems when plotting (related to RArcInfo)
Message-ID: <1037296139.2856.6.camel@chomsky>

Hello,

I am using RArcInfo to create some maps but, once I have plotted the map
(using plotarc), I try to add new lines, but the fact is that they are
not plotted.

I have reviewing the code, and if I remove a line, everything works
fine, but I am not sure whether I should do that, because that line
restores the previous 'par' profile.

Here is a portion of the code (from plotarc.R):


                par.in <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
#               on.exit(par(par.in))  <--- THIS IS THE LINE I MENTIONED

                plot.dim<-c(ymin-xmin, ymax-xmax)
                par(pin = min(par.in$pin)
                * par.in$fin / max(par.in$fin)
                * (plot.dim) / max(plot.dim))


I am not sure whether some 'read only' flag is set with that command.
can anyone help.


Thanks and best wishes,

Dear Michal,

As far as I know (and I'd be happy to be wrong), there's no *general* way 
of introducing case weights in R. The glm function, however, accommodates 
case weights via its weights argument, and this might be sufficient to do 
what you want to do. You'll have to be careful with inferences, though.

Perhaps someone else on the list can provide additional information.

Try the angle argument. [Alternately, you can look at cloud in the lattice 
library, or the xgobi library for dynamic 3d graphics (I'm not sure whether 
this is possible on platforms other than Linux).]

Thank you for your answer professor Fox.

I did perform an "experiment" (which follows) using 'weight' argument, but in lm() function. The
help page states, that this argument should contain weights used in weighted
regression fitting process. I dont feel strong in WLS I must say (to state it
diplomatically) so I dont know if it is possible use 'weight' argument to solve
my problem.

I generated the data:

x <- rep(c(1,2), c(6,4))
y <- rep(c(1,2,3,4),c(2,3,3,2))

# which look like
cbind(x,y)

# now I fit a model
summary(m <- lm(y~x))

# now when I create "collapsed" data
x1 <- rep(c(1,2), c(3,2))
y1 <- rep(c(1,2,3,4), c(1,1,2,1))

# with frequencies
w <- c(2,3,1,2,2)

# which look like
cbind(x1,y1,w)

# and fit a model
summary(m1 <- lm(y1~x1, weight=w))

I'm gettin the same coefficients, but different standard errors. I guess this is
what you had in mind.

I guess I need a book on WLS... Thank you for the answer anyway.


Michal



ps. Also, I would like to thank you for your fine lecture about S/R in Ann Arbor
this summer -- which I attended with great pleasure.

The result of the on.exit(par(par.in)) is to reset (most) graphics
parameters on the device, INCLUDING the plotting coordinate system. 
This is why your extra lines do not appear in normal usage.

This is the approach that some complex plotting functions take because
they produce a very complex and/or multiple-plot arrangement and it
would be ambiguous where annotations should be added subsequently (e.g.,
coplot, filled.contour). Whenever a plotting function uses this
approach, the plot becomes "closed" -- that is, it is not possible to
annotate the plot like usual with subsequent calls to lines, points, and
text.  

One way around this is to provide an argument to the plotting function
that allows the user to specify a "panel" function;  the panel function
is used to do annotation -- it gets called within the plotting function
where the correct coordinate systems are available.

The following example may help show the problem and solution:

    closed.plot <- function(x, y, panel=NULL, ...) {
      opar <- par(no.readonly=TRUE)
      on.exit(par(opar))
      plot(x, y, xlim=c(0, 100), ...)
      title(main="Closed Plot", adj=1, line=0)
      if (!is.null(panel))
        panel
    }
    
    par(mfrow=c(2, 1))
    plot(1:10, 1:10)
    title(main="Previous Plot", adj=1, line=0)
    axis(1, at=5, col="red", col.axis="red")
    closed.plot(1:10, 1:10)
    # annotate outside "closed" plot
    abline(h=5, lty="dotted", col="red")
    abline(v=5, lty="dotted", col="red", xpd=NA)
    text(5, 5, "What am I doing here?", col="red", adj=c(0, 0))
    axis(2, at=5, col="red", col.axis="red")
    
    par(mfrow=c(2, 1))
    plot(1:10, 1:10)
    title(main="Previous Plot", adj=1, line=0)
    # annotate "closed" plot via panel function
    closed.plot(1:10, 1:10,
                panel={ abline(v=5, h=5, lty="dotted", col="green");
                        text(5, 5, "That's better!", col="green",
                             adj=c(0, 0));
                        axis(1, at=5, col="green", col.axis="green");
                        axis(2, at=5, col="green", col.axis="green") })
    
Maybe you could encourage the RArcInfo authors to add a "panel"
argument.
Alternatively, you could encourage the RArcInfo authors to remove the
on.exit() call as you did.  At a quick glance, it does not appear that
there is a great need for it -- but I could be incredibly wrong there so
it's probably best to check with the authors :)

Thomas Lumley once did a brief but very good writeup on the various
kinds of weighting. I forget whether it was for one of the open
mailing lists or in connection with a discussion in R-core.

One thing I remember from it was the need to distinguish between the
various reasons for weighting. The one used in lm/glm is based on the
idea that some measurements are more precise than others and therefore
deserve more weight, so basically the weight is the inverse variance
of an observation. However, you might want to weight observations
differently even if their variance is the same, e.g. to obtain a
method that is stable against differences in population structure,
even if the model is slightly wrong. (Some rather subtle issues are
involved here and I'm not sure I'm representing them adequately.)

Subject: [R] exec-ing R from Java
Message-ID: <3DD42E6C.ABA157F5@epa.gov>

I'm developing a Java module which exec's R by means of
the java.lang.Runtime class.
R is started from Java with code similar to

p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/usr/bin/R --no-save");

Java then controls R by sending and receiving
messages over R's STDIN and STDOUT.
This works well except when plots are displayed to
the screen.

The windows are non interactive. They don't redraw themselves
if they resided, icon-ized , or obscured by other windows.

Can anyone please suggest how to make R plot displays
generated under Java's exec method behave like they do
when R is executed from the command line?

Hi R Gurus,

I have a question that some of you may have dealt with before.

I would redirect output to the clipboard, rather than to the screen.

Is this possible?  Is a function already written for it, or is it just
an option in print?


Any help would be appreciated.

Dear Peter and Michal,

I was under the impression that the weights argument in lm specifies 
inverse-variance weights, but that the weights argument in glm specifies 
case weights. Inverse-variance weights, which produce a WLS solution, are 
inappropriate for Michal's problem. I checked and now see that the weights 
arguments for both lm and glm are inverse-variance weights, so the 
procedure that I suggested was incorrect.

Sorry,
  John

Subject: [R] Scaling part of a data frame
Message-ID: <3DD441F6.81AA178E@noaa.gov>

I have a 30 x 27 data frame, which I'm trying to scale and transform.
Only I want to scale certain all variables except one (the dependent,
which I want to log+1 transform). I can use split() and then scale() and
log1p(), but I'm wondering if I can do this in one call.

I tried apply(), but I could only get the whole data frame, not a part
of it:

> test <- apply(chin.sub, 2, log1p)    is fine, but when I try to get only one column transformed

> test <- apply(chin.sub, chin.sub$density, log1p)
Error in apply(chin.sub, chin.sub$density, log1p) : 
        subscript out of bounds

I've tried using tapply:

> test <- tapply(chin.sub, chin.sub$density, log1p)
Error in tapply(chin.sub, chin.sub$density, log1p) : 
        arguments must have same length

Any advice on how to accomplish this?

On a related note how could I go about running the data frame
iteratively through a series of lm() statements without cutting and
pasting similar commands with diff variables or hardcoding the column
names?

e.g. do lm(x~y1)
	lm(x~y2)
	...
     end

Dear Jun,

It is working fine. It is just that it is returning the vector indices
in the correct order-you think it is returning the values.

try this

c(2,3,1,5,4)[order(c(2,3,1,5,4))]

or 

x<-c(2,3,1,5,4) #easier to follow
x[order(x)]



and look at ?sort


Cheers, 


Robert Cunningham

order and sort.list return indices, not values, so 
those are correct.  Try:

zz <- c(2,3,1,5,4)
zz[order(zz)]

Subject: [R] using list to pass argument to function 
Message-ID: <186.1125a679.2b05ab66@aol.com>

A brief follow up on an earlier posting. Thanks for the earlier suggestion.

How does it matter if I pass a list or a vector of 
arguments to a function that is written to take individual arguments:

f3args  <- function(a1, a2, a3) { definition}

f1 <- function(b1, b2) {
calculations
n <- samplesize
b<- someestimate
c<- anotherestimate
d <- c(n, b, c)
h <- sapply(rep(d, R), f3args)
}

e <- c(m, n)

k <- sapply(rep(e, R), f1)

Is there a problem with this. Can one pass a vector of arguments to a 
fucntion that is written for individual arguments. What would be a good way 
for doing this?

What is this?

    RQuantLib is an R [ http://www.r-project.org ] package to access the
    QuantLib [ http://quantlib.org ] libraries for quantitative finance. 

What is new?

    Minor documentation updates, fixes and corrections were made in release 
    0.1.1 with a small brown-bag one added for good measure in 0.1.2. The
    only new code adds a BarrierOption function.

    Maybe more interestingly, Tsvetan Stoyanov reported that he got this
    to work on Windows 2000 using the MingW/MSYS toolkit. This might not 
    be for the faint of heart as you need to be familiar with building 
    binary R packages on Windows. Still, my hat is off to Tsvetan.

Where do I get it from?

    The RQuantLib tarball is also on CRAN and its mirrors. QuantLib is
    at Sourceforge.

So I guess you are on Windows?

There is no option to do this.  We have thought about it (one could use
sink and make a `clipboard' connection) but the clipboard is not really a
standard device across versions of Windows (especially between 16-bit
versions and NT-based versions).  It looked to me too much like
trial-and-error.

It's something a Windows programmer could contribute to R, I guess.

you want something like

test[-m] <- scale(test[-m])
test$density <- log1p(test$density)

Depends what you want to do with the results. E.g. add1 will add all
single variables and report the reduction in SSq etc.  Or something like

m <- names(DF)
m <- m[-match("x", m]
do.call(lm, lapply(paste("x ~", m), as.formula))

It seems to be incomplete, so it's hard to tell what you intended. For
example,  R is undefined. But you are not passing a
second argument to f1.  You do that via an extra argument to sapply.

?do.call,

as in do.call("f1", as.list(e))

Is there a way to get the standard deviation of the estimated coefficients
returned by a manova call? Are the values stored somewhere "inside"?

Hi,

I've been trying out postscript() when onefile is set to FALSE.  However
I'm having trouble understanding the documentation for postscript().

Suppose I want to do:
  plot(1:10)
  plot(1:10, type = "l")
and store them in foo.ps and goo.ps.  Furthermore, I'd like to do then
with one postscript() command -- because this is just a simplified version
of what I really need (i.e. much more than two plots).  Can I do something
like:
  postscript(c("foo.ps", "goo.ps"), onefile = FALSE)
  plot(1:10)
  plot(1:10, type = "l")
  dev.off()
it doesn't work...

Cheers,

Kevin

- I'm slightly uncomfortable about trying to do this if you are selecting
the degree of smoothing by generalized cross validation (GCV) or unbiased
risk estimation (UBRE) which is the mgcv default. Both of these are
basically mean square error criteria, and it seems to me more logically
consistent to compare models by comparing their GCV or UBRE scores as
appropriate. If you want to model select by hypothesis testing then it's
possibly better to set up your GAMs using pure regression splines, rather
than the penalized regression splines that are the mgcv default. mgcv
allows you to do this. For example:

mod.1<-gam(y~s(v,u,k=21,fx=TRUE)+s(x,k=6,fx=TRUE))

fits a model involving a 20 df smooth of u and v and a 5 df smooth of x
(k is the basis dimension of the smooth, but you lose a df through GAM
identifiability constraints). The fitted model here is an un-penalized
GLM, so standard distributional results for GLMs hold. The basis use
maintians nested-ness of models, thereby allowing use of analysis of
deviance/variance. For example:

mod.0<-gam(y~s(v,u,k=11,fx=TRUE)+s(x,k=4,fx=TRUE))

is strictly nested within mod.1. The nesting is achieved by using a
carefully chosen "optimal" basis for each smooth, based on optimal low
rank approximation of thin plate splines: details out early next year in
JRSSB, but I can send you a pre-print if you are interested. 

If you really must mix hypothesis testing with MSE model selection then
I'd be inclined to use the very approximate p-values for terms reported by
summary.gam() - but please read the warnings in the help file first!

The docs don't mention that you can specify a vector of filenames: "For
use with onefile=FALSE give a printf format such as "Rplot%03d.ps" (the
default in that case)."
If you have specific filenames (i.e. a fixed number of plots), it's easy
to call postscript several times, isn't it?

Because colMeans in used a lot in S programming, and I found only one

It's easy to use apply, but we added internal code for the commonest

I see the Zaurus now has an X-server.

And the SL-5600 has even more memory.

Has anyone made any progress on getting R to run on this platform?

Someone has managed to get Octave going (in a mere 4Mb!)

Subject: [R] C++ interface?
Message-ID: <20021115140649.GA26053@ling.umu.se>

Dear list,

I would like to write a R package that interfaces with existing C++
classes (which I did not write myself). After having read the relevant
part of `Writing R Extensions', I have to say that the issue is still
somewhat of a mistery to me. One obvious explanation for this is that I
have not had any practical experience in C++, only C, meaning that I am
relying on what I've read a long time ago.

However, I think I'll manage if I could find example code more extensive
than the one in the `Writing R Extensions' manual. Does anyone know
of any package that are using the C++ <-> R interface that where I can
get inspiration?

What I would need is example code of class instantiation, calling of
object method as well as passing values/objects from/to C++ within R.

Greateful for all the help I can get!

/Fredrik

Message-ID: <73658706.20021115161123@poczta.onet.pl>

Hello,

Based on replies (which I'm gratefull for) I guess the only solution
is to create a package, that will contain function to build
lm()-like linear models, and allow weighting cases (as I described
two days ago).

This would also alow buliding those models for data in aggregated
form without a need for using e.g. expand$grid().

Thank you again for replies.

The following CRAN packages (at least) use C++ sources

GeneSOM, Matrix, RandomFields, Suppdists, e1071, geepack, rgenoud

I would start by looking at Matrix, which also has an article in the
DSC2001 proceedings.

The weights argument to lm and glm will give the right point estimates.
The standard errors  will potentially be wrong.  This can be fixed with
`sandwich' standard errors, so one option is to use gee() with each
observation being in a `group' on its own. Similarly, the `robust'
standard errors in coxph() will allow probability-weighted survival
analyses.

The sandwich standard errors used by gee() are not quite the same as the
ones used by survey samplers, but they are very similar and they are
consistent estimates of the same thing.

The usual linear model standard errors are often pretty good even for
probability weighting as long as  important covariates aren't strongly
associated with the weights.

The point is that I want to plot many densities in one graph. I can do
that with R using par(new=T), but I cannot print those graphs. 

Thus, I wonder if I could also apply (lapply) density(...) to a vector
of x-values, to get a my different density functions evaluated all at
the same x. Then, I should be able to write a file that looks like:

X dens1(X) dens2(X) ...

Can anyone help?

Hinnerk

Where can I find the gee() function, it's not in base package nor in

I use R 1.5.1

Subject: [R] confidence interval in "predict.lm"
Message-ID: <003201c28cc6$203d59a0$5fdc82d1@amd1>

I am studying statistics using R and a book "Understandable Statistics", by
Brase and Brase.  The book has two
worked examples for calculating a confidence interval around a predicted
value from a linear model.  The answers
to the two examples in the book differ from those I get from R.  The
regression line, the standard error, and the
predicted value in
R and the book all agree for the examples.  Hence I gather that R and the
book use different formula to calculate
the confidence interval.  Could someone explain why the difference exists,
and which function(s) in R I might use
to get the answers in the book, and (perhaps) an explanation as to which
method to use in various situations).

The example:

> x<-c(10,20,30,40,50,60,70)
> y<-c(17,21,25,28,33,40,49)
> dat <- data.frame(temp=x,amnt=y)
  temp amnt
1   10   17
2   20   21
3   30   25
4   40   28
5   50   33
6   60   40
7   70   49

being a table of temperatures (temp) and the corresponding amounts of copper
sulfate that disolve in 100g of water
at that temperature.

The regression line:

> mod <- lm(amnt ~ temp,dat)
> summary(mod)

Call:
lm(formula = amnt ~ temp, data = dat)

Residuals:
      1       2       3       4       5       6       7
 1.7857  0.7143 -0.3571 -2.4286 -2.5000 -0.5714  3.3571

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 10.14286    1.98463   5.111  0.00374 **
temp         0.50714    0.04438  11.428 8.98e-05 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 `***' 0.001 `**' 0.01 `*' 0.05 `.' 0.1 ` ' 1

Residual standard error: 2.348 on 5 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-Squared: 0.9631,     Adjusted R-squared: 0.9558
F-statistic: 130.6 on 1 and 5 DF,  p-value: 8.985e-05

The .95 confidence interval for a temperature of 45 degrees:
>
foo<-predict(mod,data.frame(temp=45),level=.95,interval="confidence",se.fit=
T)
> foo
$fit
          fit      lwr      upr
[1,] 32.96429 30.61253 35.31604

$se.fit
[1] 0.9148715

$df
[1] 5

$residual.scale
[1] 2.348252

The book gives the confidence interval as 26.5 <= y <= 39.5.  The book
defines the confidence interval calculation thus:

  yp - E <= y <= yp + E

  Where
   E = tc*sC *sqrt(1 + 1/n + (x-xBar)^2/SSx)
   yp is the predicted value from the regression line
   tc is the value from Student's t distribution for a confidence
    level, c, using n-2 degrees of freedom,
   sC is the standard error of estimate
   SSx is Sum(x^2)-[Sum(x)]^2/n
   n is the number of data pairs.

So that even though the model, predicted value, standard error all agree, R
gives a much smaller confidence
interval than the book does.

Thanks for any advice/help.

Are you talking about overlaying all the density estimates in the same plot?
If you have the density estimates in a matrix, just use something like:

matplot(X, density.X, type="l")

where X is the vector of points where density is estimated (e.g., the x
component of a density object) and density.X is the matrix containing the
density estimates.  Check out the options to matplot in its help page.

HTH,
Andy

Surprisingly enough it is in the gee package.

Subject: [R] collapse rows in a matrix
Message-ID: <AF84AD19B4A8D411B18500508BAF0E0E018B56F2@se-excur01-uslj.nadi.uslj>

Hi, all,
  I have a little problem to solve. I'd like to collapse rows which are next
to each other but have
 same value to one row. The following is an example.

say x is a data frame like:
   X1 X2 X3 X4 X5
a  1  0  0  0  1
b  1  0  1  0  1
c  1  0  0  0  1
d  1  0  0  0  1
e  1  0  0  0  1
f  1  1  0  0  1
g  1  1  0  0  1

notice that  a, c,d,e are the same. since c,d,e are next to each other, I
will only use the middle
one,i.e d.   I will also  keep a although it is the same as d.

f,g , I will keep f or g.

so the ideal output is: 
a  1  0  0  0  1
b  1  0  1  0  1
d  1  0  0  0  1
f  1  1  0  0  1

Any idea how to do it?  Thanks!!

Y. Fan
by the way,
unique(x) does not give me the desired output:  it remove c,d,e
  X1 X2 X3 X4 X5
a  1  0  0  0  1
b  1  0  1  0  1
f  1  1  0  0  1

You can install and use "xwit" to modify the R graphics window after it has
been created.  To modify all open X11 graphics devices:
R> system("xwit -name 'Hello world' -names 'R Graphics'")

If you need to specify just the current device:
R> system(paste("xwit -name 'Hello world' -names 'R Graphics: Device ",
+               dev.cur(), "'", sep=""))

I use "xwit" to move the window where I like it (-move option), and it can do
other things as well.  Download it from <ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/>.

Another way to do get multiple density estimates in the same plot:

dens1 <- density(VAR1)
dens0 <- density(VAR2)
plot(dens1$x,dens1$y,type="n",xlim=c(min(c(dens1$x,dens0$x)),max(c(dens1$x,d
ens0$x))),ylim=c(min(c(dens1$y,dens0$y)),max(c(dens1$y,dens0$y))))
lines(dens1)
lines(dens0)

where dens0, dens1 represent kernel densities of your VAR1 and VAR2,
respectively, and the third line simply sets the axes to the max and min
values of the densities.

Best,

Dan

There's no problem with data in aggregated form, only with probability
weighting.

You asked R for a confidence interval for the predicted mean at x.  If you
want a prediction interval at x you need  interval="prediction" not
interval="confidence".

The book is giving you a prediction interval, aka a tolerance
interval. Some people use the term "confidence interval" a bit too
sloppily. predict() will give you the other kind of interval if you
ask it to. Vice versa, 

E = tc*sC *sqrt(1/n + (x-xBar)^2/SSx) 

would give you the confidence interval for the predicted mean, I think.

This works well - thanks! Somehow I overlooked this parameter in

The problem is with your quote from the book.  That formula is not a
confidence interval, it is a tolerance interval, Use predict.lm with
interval="prediction" to get it.

I suggest you get a better (or at least more understandable) book!

Use pointsize in the postscript() call. That way the margins will be set
at the right size for the labels.

Depends on what you mean with "aggregation" doesn't it? If you have
"replication weights" (counts of data with given value), I think you
still have problems.

There's no problem for categorical data, which is the case where you
most likely to have counts of data with given value.

With a linear model you can aggregate further to get an average value over
each covariate pattern and then have variance weights

Slightly OT question to this thread:

How can I get critical values for given distribution density?
E.g. function f which would give me 2.228 for ft(p=0.05,df=10)
(i.e., t for student distribution with given level probability).

Sorry for newbie question.

You might also look at src/inter.cc in package geepack. geepack uses TNT
(Template Numerical Toolkit, http://math.nist.gov/tnt/). Several interface 
functions are defined in inter.cc to covert an R object into a C++ object,
and to convert a C++ object to R object.

I think the following will do what you seem to want (except that it keeps 
the first of duplicated rows, i.e., of rows "c","d" & "e", it keeps "c")

 > x <- read.table(header=T,file=stdin(),nrow=7)
   X1 X2 X3 X4 X5
a  1  0  0  0  1
b  1  0  1  0  1
c  1  0  0  0  1
d  1  0  0  0  1
e  1  0  0  0  1
f  1  1  0  0  1

 > x[which(c(1,apply(apply(x, 2, diff), 1, any))!=0),,drop=FALSE]

a  1  0  0  0  1
b  1  0  1  0  1
c  1  0  0  0  1
f  1  1  0  0  1

This expression depends on any() returning TRUE if any of the values it is 
given are non-zero, which does seem to work for negative integers, and for 
any finite floating-point number.

However, the expression above doesn't work if there are NA values -- for it 
to work in the presence of NAs you need to replace "any" by something like 
"function(x) identical(all(x==0),TRUE)" (leaving the quotes off) (Are there 
any more elegant ways of expressing this?)

Hope this helps,

There's no direct way to do this (mainly because calculating nicely spaced 
tick positions is somewhat non-trivial, and also to have compatibility with 
Trellis). The ideal workaround is to use something like

xyplot(sunspot ~ 1:37, type = "l", 
       scales=list(y=list(log = TRUE, at = c(5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200))))

Unfortunately, this seems to be broken in the latest lattice. I'll try to fix 
it, in the meantime you could use 

xyplot(log(sunspot) ~ 1:37, type = "l", 
       scales=list(y=list(at = log(c(5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200)),
                          labels = as.character(c(5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200)),
       )))

Is length(CEMPLOY) approximately 300 ?

?var says:

Details:

     [...]

     The denominator n - 1 is used which gives an unbiased estimator of
     the (co)variance for i.i.d. observations. These functions return
     `NA' when there is only one observation (whereas S-plus has been
     returning `NaN'), and from R 1.2.3 fail if `x' has length zero.

Subject: [R] shared ATLAS library?
Message-ID: <3DD57A2D.186016EC@bank-banque-canada.ca>

>From "R Installation and Administration:"

   Note that the BLAS library will be used for several add-on packages as 
   well as for R itself. This means that it is better to use a
   shared BLAS library, as most of a static library will be compiled 
   into the R executable and each BLAS-using package. 

Is there an idiots guide on how to do this (or should idiots just not try). I've
compiled atlas as a static (.a) library and successfully built R (although, when
it is static, I don't know how to tell for sure that it is being used). However,
their seems to be little indication of how to make a shared (.so) ATLAS library.
I've had even less success with blas from netlib. (I compiled .so files and
generated a file libblas.so, but there are a lot of unresolved symbols, so R
crashes.)

Any help would be appreciated. (Linux or Solaris).

Thanks,
Paul Gilbert

I think you can use nm on the R.bin file -- if you compiled with static
ATLAS there should a bunch of ATL_* symbols.

Subject: [R] Plotting in the margin
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.44.0211151855110.2564-100000@is06.fas.harvard.edu>


Hi,

I would like to place a line (tilted at an angle) in the margin of an R
plot.  Is there any way to place such an annotation outside the plotting
area?

As an alternative, being able to plot a rotated character (the pipe, |) in
the margin would be sufficient.  The problem is that mtext doesn't work
with the srt option.

As a further alternative, if I could put a legend in the margin, I could
use the text command within the legend, and then srt would work (I've
checked, and text("|",srt=x) seems to work for various values of x besides
multiples of 90).  But I don't know how to put a legend in the margin
either.

Does anyone see how to make any of these approaches work?  Or perhaps
there is yet another alternative?

Thanks,

Chris Adolph

this may point you in the right direction.  Can't say I've done it myself.

Take a look at this post by Paul Murrell just a few days ago. He
provides some example code to do this.

Gregory Warnes provides a different approach in the same thread here:

For Linux, I feel compelled to plug in Camm's great work for Atlas under
Debian. It simply works out of the box, and my R packages use it. No
configuration on the user part whatsoever. As for Solaris, can't help
there...

Message-ID: <2364.24.222.53.108.1037413195.squirrel@mail.email4all.ca>

I am developing a PHP script and want to use R to get the probability of a
t-value.

This just requires that I issue one R statement and output the result.

The problem I am having is that R will accept batch input but I am not
sure that it will accept a "one-liner" (i.e., "/usr/local/bin/R qt(.975,
20)"  does not work but you get the idea).

Is there a way to pass R a one-liner without having to put it into a batch
file and submit it to R as a batch job.

Regards,
Paul Meagher

this works so far, but could you please give my a hint what I did wrong?
what does the get() do ?

I was struggeling inside some other for loops, and it seems that there
was another get() missing.
So do I have to use the get() always inside a loop in order to "get" the
correct i-values pasted in ?

Thank you

various possibilities for this using unix redirection
e.g.

david% echo "3+4" | R --slave
[1] 7

One could for example set this up as a shell script "Roneliner",
so that

david% Roneliner "3+4"
[1] 7

Possibly it's more economical also to use arguments
     --no-restore --no-save --no-readline --gui=none
in addition to --slave.

Subject: [R] using the function "expression" with "paste" in a plot
Message-ID: <DAV92wB0jTj7zzobr1w000046ef@hotmail.com>

Hi,
I noticed that paste and expression in the following manner does not produce
the desired result.

vnames=c("pi","y","delta")
vx=vn=3
m=16
# mydata any matrix that takes for the following form
mydata=array(somedata,c(m,vn,vx))
# producing plots
for (j in 1:vx){
for (i in 1:vn)
{
plot(mydata, type="l", main=expression(paste("Effect of",
vnames[j],"on",vnames[i])), xlab="Lags (quarters)", ylab="Response")
}
}

The title appears as "Effect of vnamesj on vnamesi". Without the function
"expression" title for j=1 and i=2 appears as "Effect of pi on y". The
desired outcome would be return the word "pi" rather than a Greek letter.

Is there any simple way to overcome this situation.

Thank you
Ahmad Abu Hammour

Dear helpers,

I'm working with expression matrices (DNA microarrays) and my 
professor suggested me to investigate the possibilities of 
Xgobi. Searching the net I found that I could use it with R. Is 
that true?
How can I do this? I'm working on a Windows ME notebook. I've 
already got xgobi.zip from CRAN and xgobi.zip from Professor 
Brian Ripley (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/SWin/) but I don't 
know how to install it. I read Peter Ho's e-mail to R-help but 
I still got problems.
Could you help me?

Thanks in advance

Luis

Yes. Use substitute()

main=substitute(paste("Effect of", foo, "on", bar),
     list(foo=vnames[j], bar=vnames[i]))

If you want the Greek letters rather than the names, use

main=substitute(....
     list(foo=as.name(vnames[j]), bar=as.name(vnames[i])))

or perhaps something like

vnames <- expression(pi, y, delta)
plot(....
main=substitute(paste("Effect of", foo, "on", bar),
     list(foo=vnames[[j]], bar=vnames[[i]]))
)

"i" just contains a string.  What you want is the object with that name,
which is what get() gives you.  Do read the help page for get().

If anyone wants to try, I'd expect that a no-graphics R would be
fairly simple to do (for a start), *provided* we can get past the NA
representation issue that bugged us on the Debian/ARM machines.

What kind of problems?  If you unzip xgobi.zip from Prof. Ripley's page,
into say C:\xgobi, then open the README file in C:\xgobi it has a very
detailed explanation on how to set up and get it working.    You will
however need an X server.

Subject: [R] using list to pass argument to function
Message-ID: <0245D37B.40E6F749.41D576E4@aol.com>

Thanks for the clarifications. All the symbols below refer to scalars, unless they are assigned to a non-scalar explicitly.

I am trying to do the following. Would like to avoid using for-loops where possible, so that program can also be used in S efficiently.

1. Create an CxC contingency table (matrix) with certain cell frequencies: Is there are better way of assigning "population" probabilities of cells to contingency table and sampling from it? 
2. Use the contingency table sampling function suggested by Ripley to create a sample ("population sample"), of size n.
3. Compute row and col frequencies and estimates of marginal probabilities: below f1 computes c,d for 2x2 (for a row and a col, the other can be calcualted by 1-c, 1-d inside a fucntion that uses them: f3args).
4. Compute K statistics based on marginal probabilities: f3args does this.
5. use R bootstrap samples of size n based on marginal probabilities to compute standard errors for the statistics estimates.
6. for each population sample use R samples based on *population cell probabilities* and compute same std errs (SD in this case) ("MC-SD"). 
7. Do this for M samples from population k <- below attempts that (sorry for overloading on R, that should be different, say S): that is, repeat steps 2--6, M times (M is the value of S variable).
8. Store the MxK statistics from popoulation samples, their std. errs, and corresponding MC-SD's in a matrix for use,((Mx(3xK)) matrix.

A question: I think the point is to differentiate between a vector of arguments and a list of arguments, because a vector of arguments is treated as value of one argument. Right? Then, how does one pass a list as a value for one argument, without converting it into a vector?

Another Question: what is a good way to update R from disk (not online--can't get the wireless drivers to work on SuSE 7.1. So, have to use windows for internet.)?

It seems to be incomplete, so it's hard to tell what you intended. For 
example, R is undefined. But you are not passing a 
second argument to f1. You do that via an extra argument to sapply.

?do.call, 


as in do.call("f1", as.list(e))

I'm trying to view plots in the r-base statistical package.  According

the graphics package is loaded automatically with the x11( ) command. 
However,
apparently it isn't;  moreover, I get

                          "x11 device has not been loaded"

when I type x11( ) at the command prompt in r-base.  Any suggestions how to
load x11 device?

Hi,

It is detailed in Prof. Ripley's README file.  There are several kind of X
Servers, e.g. StarNet's XWin32, http://www.starnet.com/, or CygWin's
CygWin/XFree86, http://xfree86.cygwin.com/.  The former is a commercial
package which cost lots of money -- though academic license is relatively
cheaper.  The later is a free, open sourced one.

It is lots of hassle.  You may want to take a look at GGobi , www.ggobi.org.
Which is like a Windows version of XGobi which does not require an X Server.

Cheers,

Kevin

Or this:

BTW, what do you think Roneliner would look like as a shell script?

The most economical startup options would be good to know.

My guess would be just  --vanilla option?

Hi again,

Thanks for the tips on Xgobi. I'll try them. Now I have another 
question. There is a package (not submitted to CRAN yet), that 
I would like to use, but it has the extension .tar, so it's for 
Linux platforms am I rigth? Is it possible from those files to 
compile for Windows?

Nice weekend for all

No.  R source packages are for *all* platforms, and usually have a .tar.gz
extension.

However do you think the CRAN binary packages for Windows are created?
This is covered in many places, for example the rw-FAQ.

You can program a Windows dialog box to come up anywhere you choose.

I wish to make a vector of line types something like c("21", "32")
which is simple enough to do.  But if I want to have a continuous line
part of that vector, I'd have thought "40" would produce a blank space
of zero length thereby achieving the desired effect.  Not so.

Even less predictable is if I try "A0".  The result seems to be
similar to specifying "A8" (approximately).  Is that by design?

It's no surprise that lty = 1 cannot mix with lty = "32" but in the
end, I discovered that c("21", "32", "solid") will do what I want,
though it wasn't obvious.

Is something lacking in the documentation or just in my comprehension?

Subject: [R] SVD for reducing dimensions
Message-ID: <200211180955.44332.lakeland@cs.otago.ac.nz>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all, this is probably simple and I'm just doing something stupid, sorry 
about that :-)

I'm trying to convert words (strings of letters) into a fairly small 
dimensional space (say 10, but anything between about 5 and 50 would be ok), 
which I will call a feature vector.  The the distance between two words 
represents the similarity of the contexts of the words, so big and little 
have very similar contexts and should get a similar representation. Basically 
to build something similar to a thesaurus.

I have computed bigram counts between the n most common words, for varying 
values of n between 500 and 5000. These are saved to a file which I can load 
with read.table.  This matrix is symmetric and far from sparse, although I 
can adjust the sparseness by changing the bigram window.  First question, 
should I scale the counts? The angle is all that is really important, I'd 
like 1,1,1,2 to be basically the same as 2,2,2,4, perhaps with that the 
latter having more weight in resolving disrepencies.

Next is the job of reducing the matrix from 500 dimensions to say 10.  I think 
the correct way of doing this is using SVD, does that sound right? At least, 
I have read a paper by Schuetze which used SVD. Other algorithms (K-means, 
SOM) also sound applicable but may balk at the amount of data, or might not 
provide the distance property I'm trying to get. 

However I must be doing something stupid here because the result I get from 
SVD has n dimensions instead of k.  Firstly, I don't seem to be able to use 
La.svd at all, and for normal svd I'm not getting the results I expect.

> x <- read.table("bigram.500")
> xs <- La.svd(x)
Error in La.svd(x) : argument to La.svd must be numeric or complex

> xs <- svd(x)
> ncol(xs$v)
[1] 500
> nrow(xs$v)
[1] 500
> nrow(xs$u)
[1] 500
> ncol(xs$u)
[1] 500

Also, how should I locate the million or so less common words into the space 
generated by this? Running svd on the full bigrams sounds infeasable, it 
would be a 200GB matrix, for a start. Really I just want to 'predict' their 
location rather than build the classifier with a larger set.

Thank you for your time

I build the tseries packages with the "Rcmd" command and also with "make 
pkg-tseries" command.

I now check the package (so maybe the problem is in the package) with:
"make pkgcheck-tseries"
And the execution crashes with this output (tseries-Ex.Rout file)  on

The source is available...

It says that (assuming we're talking about the x11 device) "0" is
solid and any other 0-nybbles (= half-bytes, hex digits) are converted
to "1" to prevent X11 from falling over.

Well, what you ended up doing is completely documented in help(par).

The page might be clearer that 0-nybbles are undesirable, and if
any behaviour is driver-specific, the help page for the device should
probably say something about it.

I neglected to say that it was the postscript device I was referring
to.  The "A0" == "A8" phenemonon does not happen with x11.  It seems
to be more like "A0" == "AA", and not "A1" which I'd understand from
that explanation.

Complete maybe, but not obvious.  The par help indicates two ways of
specifying lty using integars or character strings, and then gives an
"Alternative" customized way.  Nothing indicates that the second of
the standard ways can be combined with the "Alternative" method.  Easy
once you know though (like everything).

The behaviour is quite different on X11 and postscript, that's for
sure, so that probably should be indicated.  When I understand exactly
how it works, I'll offer to clarify the help file.

I also have the same bug under Linux. As far as I know, this is not new. 
I it had for almost a year, with previous versions of R and tseries Here 
is the relevant information.

Ah-ha! Could you redo that with R -d gdb, please? (use the "bt"
command at the segfault).

It's not happening to me with 1.7.0 under RH7.3, so I suppose it could
be something compiler specific, or maybe the random number generation
(I don't get the same results either).

Before we get too much of this, Duncan Murdoch has found that
predict.garch calls its C code with one too few arguments.  That would be
consistent with the crashes seen on some builds and not others.

I think it is in the maintainers' court.

Subject: [R] SVD for reducing dimensions
In-Reply-To: <200211180955.44332.lakeland@cs.otago.ac.nz>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0211180838210.19182-100000@gannet.stats>

A couple of pointers:

a) the result of read.table is not a matrix but a data frame, so you need
to ensure you have a matrix.  as.matrix would help, but I suspect you
would do better to use scan() if the matrix is at all large.

b) You seem to be describing a skeletal version of principal components
analysis. PCA will give as many PCs as input dimensions unless told
otherwise.  Reading up about PCA (and feature extraction methods more
generally) would be helpful, I think.  PCA can `predict' new points.

Subject: [R] several functions in the same plot
Message-ID: <200211181056.gAIAukD04086@ensam.inra.fr>

Hello,
Is it possible to plot several functions on a same plot? 
example: 3 functions : f(x), g(x), h(x) 
I would like to obtain one graphic with x-axis and y-axis 
and the 3 functions plotted to compare them.

lines(f2,lty=2)
lines(f3,lty=3)

where f1, f2 and f3 are your functions.

If the functions are all evaluated at the same set of x values, then you can
use something like:

matplot(x, cbind(fx, gx, hx), type="l")

where fx, gx and hx are the function values.  The advantage of this over
plot() followed by lines() is that the limits on y-axis automatically
account for all three functions.

Dear R users,

I have just upgraded R v1.5.0 to v1.6.1 for Windows but have trouble loading my library of R only functions (no C calls).  After examining the "library" script this difference was found:

(v1.5.0)
which.lib.loc <- dirname(pkgpath)
            descfile <- system.file("DESCRIPTION", package = package, 
                lib.loc = which.lib.loc)
            if (nchar(descfile)) 
                testRversion(descfile)
            if (exists("packageHasNamespace") && packageHasNamespace(package, 
                which.lib.loc)) 
                return(doNamespaceLibrary(package, which.lib.loc, 
                  lib.loc, logical.return))
            codeFile <- file.path(which.lib.loc, package, "R", 
                package)
            loadenv <- new.env(hash = TRUE, parent = .GlobalEnv)

(v1.6.1)
which.lib.loc <- dirname(pkgpath)
            descfile <- system.file("DESCRIPTION", package = package, 
                lib.loc = which.lib.loc)
            if (nchar(descfile)) 
                testRversion(descfile)
            else stop("This is not a valid package -- no DESCRIPTION exists")
            if (exists("packageHasNamespace") && packageHasNamespace(package, 
                which.lib.loc)) 
                return(doNamespaceLibrary(package, which.lib.loc, 
                  lib.loc, logical.return))
            codeFile <- file.path(which.lib.loc, package, "R", 
                package)


As a result, an error pops: This is not a valid package -- no DESCRIPTION exists

How do I modify my library of functions to load it properly like previous versions do?  Why v1.6.1 checks for "DESCRIPTIONS"?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: [R] vector of center of 
Message-ID: <200211181321.OAA24611@cassis-gw.univ-brest.fr>

Hello

I have a vector gd of 279 values of diameter of limpets.

Using 'hist(gd, breaks=seq(10,60,5),plot=F)' I can obtain a vector of 
10 centers of size-class ($mids).

But I'd like to work on a vector of 279 values being the mids (centers
of size-classes) corresponding to the respective 279 values in gd.

I looked in the different manuals and in archives of list but didn't find how
to obtain such a vector... I looked around in the manual of functions such as
levels, density, ... but didn't find a simple solution, which may exists I
believe.

thanks so much for taking time to answer this (naive/newbie) question.

Fred

Sorry... for this (I have to think before pressing the "send" button).

I have found what I was looking for in R-exts.pdf which accompanies the binary executable.

And the necessary DESCRIPTION file in a library directory ease documentation and makes things more orderly!  Bravo!

cut will give you a factor identifying the class for each point, and
if you have a vector of midpoints just index it by the factor.

Did you read the NEWS file?  Quite a bit has changed in that 3-version
upgrade.

To load it properly (and you were not loading it properly before)  you
need to follow the instructions in `Writing R Extensions' about how to
create a package, and then on how to install it.

These days R relies on properly constructed packages, and it does now
check for this.  For ages packages have been required to have a
DESCRIPTION file.

I think there should be, but I suppose it's a tradeoff between convenience and
"function creep".  In any case, here's an implementation that uses the existing
(fast) functions, is reasonably compatible with the S-Plus versions, and gives
the same results as "apply":


colVars <- function(x, na.rm=FALSE, dims=1, unbiased=TRUE, SumSquares=FALSE,
                    twopass=FALSE) {
  if (SumSquares) return(colSums(x^2, na.rm, dims))
  N <- colSums(!is.na(x), FALSE, dims)
  Nm1 <- if (unbiased) N-1 else N
  if (twopass) {x <- if (dims==length(dim(x))) x - mean(x, na.rm=na.rm) else
                     sweep(x, (dims+1):length(dim(x)), colMeans(x,na.rm,dims))}
  (colSums(x^2, na.rm, dims) - colSums(x, na.rm, dims)^2/N) / Nm1
}
rowVars <- function(x, na.rm=FALSE, dims=1, unbiased=TRUE, SumSquares=FALSE,

  N <- rowSums(!is.na(x), FALSE, dims)
  Nm1 <- if (unbiased) N-1 else N
  if (twopass) {x <- if (dims==0) x - mean(x, na.rm=na.rm) else
                     sweep(x, 1:dims, rowMeans(x,na.rm,dims))}
  (rowSums(x^2, na.rm, dims) - rowSums(x, na.rm, dims)^2/N) / Nm1
}
colStdevs <- function(x, ...) sqrt(colVars(x, ...))
rowStdevs <- function(x, ...) sqrt(rowVars(x, ...))

Message-ID: <5789A42DD684734298BF9EC852D3511156E433@scad1exis02.alldata.net>

Hello all. I have two small questions in one post, for the sake of brevity.

1. I have some objects that I want to delete. I have the line:
rm (c (channelheader, paste ("channel", 1:3, sep="")))

I have tried a few variations, including list=, but cannot figure it out. In
SAS, I can use a ':' as a wildcard. Is there any equivalent in R?

2. Is there any possible was to order data by the second to last character?

TIA.

Subject: [R] R on Sharp Zaurus 5500?
Message-ID: <15833.16008.338303.898580@levy.math.csi.cuny.edu>

For what it is worth, here are my experiences.

When I first got my zaurus I compiled R version 1.4.0 for the it. It took
some time to do, but managed with the skiffclusters at familiar.org.
(libf2c was the hardest part). Compilation should be easier now that there
are onboard compilers but I haven't tried.

I thought this would be neat to have in the classroom. (It did get one
student to buy a zaurus) Unfortunately performance was horribly slow
(this was on the 32meg model and memory was tight as I didn't have
stuff stored on my SD card), writing to postscript (how I was going to
view graphics) was buggy (floating point emulation issue?) and the
whole thing prone to crash.  I then compiled the oldest R version I
could find: 0.49. This actually ran well, although it did not survive
a suspend event which made usage tedious. I still couldn't view
graphics though. I don't know about the NA issue mentioned here.

Subject: [R] Ordering of rows/names
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10211181503330.7316-100000@engmail.uwaterloo.ca>

Hi all,

I have a data.frame e3.  I use a function on it:
n3 <- normalize.qspline(x = e3, samples = 0.07, na.rm = TRUE);

The resulting data.frame has lost it's row-names and column names.  This
is the natural behaviour of the function I am calling, and I can't alter
that at the moment.  However, the data *is* in the correct order, as it
was initially -- the names are just missing in the new data structure.

If I just use:
q3 <- data.frame(n3, row.names=e3[,1]);
names(q3) <- names(e3)[2:length(names(e3))];

Am I guaranteed to be assigning the row & column names in the correct
order?  In all the test-cases I have done, they DO appear in the correct
order, but I wanted to verify that this behaviour is indeed a true
R-feature as opposed to a nice thing just occurring on my platform.

Any feedback would very much be appreciated!
Paul

With R 1.6.1 on NT, if I do

nice rectangular boxes emerge. But in the case of 

   pdf("foo.pdf"); plot(1:10, type='h', lwd=10); dev.off()

the boxes have (IMHO at least) ugly rounded edges. Is that intentional?

Yes.  Try in postscript() too.  I just followed postscript, but
consciously that one had to specify the desired behaviour.

That's not the way to draw boxes ....

Sophisticated graphics interfaces have options for how lines end and join,
but S's (and hence R's) predates such things.  )But Windows' GDI does not,
as far as I know.)

The NA issue showed up first as a PostScript bug under Debian/ARM too,
so it sounds pretty much like it happens on the Zaurus as well.

Impossible to say without knowing what is inside your function.
But why are you getting the row names from the first column of e3 and not
from its row names?

The following construction is often useful.

new <- old

new[] <- someFunction(old)

which changes the entries but preserves the attributes (including names
and row names).  In your case it might be new[-1].

Exactly. For a bar plot, try barplot().

Not by much I think. PostScript has always had round/bevel/miter joins
and is roughly the same age as S. Of course the GRZ model on which S
builds is still older... I think the basic issue is that round joins
are the only thing that works at acute angles without unpleasant
artifacts, so if we want a single common polyline routine to do all
line drawing, round joins will look best, and line endings follow from
that I believe, but things like box(lwd=10) get to look odd. I suppose
we could add a graphics parameter for join style. One more or less...

BTW, I gather that GDI does have PS_JOIN_MITER &friends, or was that
not what you meant?

For clarification are you referring to using help.search("KeyWord") or help.start()?

I am guessing the latter.

One quick check:  Be sure that JavaScript for Navigator is enabled, which is on the
Advanced -> Scripts & Plug-Ins tab in Preferences. Both need to be enabled.

Both work for me using R 1.6.1 under RH 8.0, however I am using the Gtk2/Xft enabled
version of Mozilla 1.2b, which is available at:

http://komodo.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/experimental/gtk2/

This version, while pre-release, has been very stable and makes a major difference in readability.

I am also using Java V1.4.1, which is available here:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html

Finally, I am now running kernel V2.4.18-18.8.0. This is two updates since the original release.

So, there may be differences in our respective configurations that could possibly
confound a common solution.

Let me know on these and I can try to assist if the JavaScript check does not help.

Subject: [R] plotting intersecting planes
Message-ID: <4CE94EAEAD60B744B9263A2C82A9C79219EAE4@alpha.usq.edu.au>

Hi all

In two days, I am giving a small, informal workshop in our
Department about using R.  Initially, it was just for statistician,
but surprisingly (to me anyhow) many mathematicians are also
coming who have a MATLAB background.  They are coming at the
Workshop from a teaching perspective.

They are considering using R to avoid licensing issues with
MATLAB.  One thing they were hoping me to show them was some
3D plotting.  I have used  persp  and  image  and all.  But what 
about, say, plottting intersecting planes?  I can't seem to find a 
way of plotting in 3D, and then adding another plot.
I guess I am after a 3D equivalent of  lines  or  points;
one plots the original plot and then adds to it.

Ideally, this would be a simple task; we wouldn't want to have
our students mucking about too much to plot two planes intersecting.

Thanks as always.

P.

Hi,

I assume that you are using R under windows. Try functions memory.size()
and memory.limit(). The first will show how much memory R uses and the
second will set the maximum memory size R can use. Something like

memory.limit(512)

will do the trick. It tells R that it can use up to 512MB of memory. Do
?memory.limit for more details.

I think that these functions are only in R build for Windows. If you
can't avoid using a lot of memory I shoud advise you (based on my
personal experience) to use R under Linux.

Hi, 

Is it possible to make R start not from terminal with option
--gui=GNOME? Now if in the launcher preferences checkbox run from
terminal is not checked, R with option --gui=GNOME doesn't start. If
started with checked checkbox, i.e. from terminal, besides R, terminal
window also appears, but it is of no use. Yet if it is closed, the R
window closes together. Is this a feature, or is there a way to avoid
this? 

Thanks for any help

Hi,

channelheader <- "CHH" # you need to define it
rm (c (channelheader, paste ("channel", 1:3, sep="")))

gives an error, but

rm (list=c (channelheader, paste ("channel", 1:3, sep="")))

should remove objects

CHH, channel1, channel2, channel3

It is possible to list objects using regexp (a generalisation of
wildcards, look ?grep).  E.g. you may write

objs <- ls(pattern="^channel[1-3]")
rm(list=c(channelhead, objs))

in order to achive the same result as above.
Perhaps it helps

I use the following custom function for such a result :

midpoint <- function(x, dx) {
y  <- (round((x-dx/2)/dx))*dx+dx/2
y
}

It gives the corresponding midpoints of your data, based on equally spaced 
classes (width = dx) starting at the origin of the x axis.

Hope this helped,

The help.start() search engine does seem to be very sensitive to versions
of Mozilla (and Netscape based on Mozilla).  For me (under RH7.2), 1.0
worked, 1.1 did not and 1.2beta does, as does Netscape 7.0 (but
not its PR1).  I have not tried 1.0.1, but an upgrade seems a good idea.

See: ->  help(ls) -> use of argument "pattern" -> regular expressions
Take care: wild characters / regular expressions are dangerous in
removal processes

I'm assuming from the FCC header that you're on some sort of Unix-like
system, but I've no idea if that's what you do your R work on.  What
follows is for Unix(ish) systems.

1) 554 Kb is just the most recent request to allocate more memory;
there might've been a lot of memory grabbed by R before that.

2) If that's not the problem, get your system administrator to increase
your memory quotas (man ulimit should clarify).

Hi,

I had that problem already. In windows I did this

C:\Programas\R\rw1060\bin\Rgui.exe --max-mem-size=400M

in the icon path of R. You'll have to try several sizes. For me 
it worked with 400M. I think R simulates the memory in the hard 
disk. Read de R FAQ.

Hi all, Sorry for what might be a trivial issue. However, I am
completely flummoxed!

I'm making a filled contour plot for a publication. It's a continuous
wavelet transform should anybody care. The problem I'm having is
correctly demarking the ticks on the y axis. I have a matrix that has
100 columns. Every 10th column represents a power of 2. So: 
col[10] <- 2 
col[20] <- 4
col[30] <- 8

and so on until col[100] <- 2^10

I'm having trouble scaling my plot accordingly. Can anybody help? I
imagine that one uses the plot.axes argument but I'm having trouble
figuring out how to do it. The matrix is already a log scale so the
ticks and numbers are evenly spaced by 10.

Thanks in advance, Andy

Example:
junk.mat <- matrix(rnorm(12800), 128, 100)
xYears <- 1:nrow(junk.mat)
yPeriod <- 1:ncol(junk.mat)

filled.contour(xYears, 
               yPeriod,
               junk.mat,
               color = terrain.colors)
#?             plot.axes = { axis(2, seq(??))}

I'm having trouble scaling my plot accordingly. Can anybody help? I
imagine that one uses the plot.axes argument but I'm having trouble
figuring out how to do it. The matrix is already a log scale so the
ticks and numbers are evenly spaced by 10.

Thanks in advance, Andy

Example:
junk.mat <- matrix(rnorm(12800), 128, 100)
xYears <- 1:nrow(junk.mat)
yPeriod <- 1:ncol(junk.mat)

filled.contour(xYears, 
               yPeriod,
               junk.mat,
               color = terrain.colors)
#?             plot.axes = { axis(2, seq(??))}

Subject: [R] Units of measurement
Message-ID: <20021119092644.5825605f.fharrell@virginia.edu>

In many surveys, especially multinational ones that are based on paper forms, it is common to enter continuous variables in one field with a categorical variable for units of measurement (with 2 or 3 levels, usually) in the next field.  This is done to prevent conversion errors in the field.  Conversions to international standard units can take place just after data import or it can be deferred until statistical computations are done.  For the latter model an S object which is a triple of (numeric measurement,factor variable containing units for current subject,standard target units) would be easy to implement, with an as.numeric( ) method or other conversion function to convert to user-specified units (default=standard target units).  A print method would just print the units next to the value, with units varying across subjects.

There are several resources for units conversions such as the units program in Linux/Unix (which comes with a database of linear and nonlinear units conversions in ascii file units.dat) and several web sites.  Has anyone interfaced any general units conversion utilities to S?

Thanks in advance,

Frank

In addition to the code in package ts there is multivariate Kalman
filter and smoother code in the dse bundle on CRAN. See

 help(l.SS, package=dse1)

or the Users' Guide. (I believe there is also Kalman filter code in one
or two other packages.)

		 plot.axes={ axis(1); axis(2, at=10*(1:10),labels=2^(1:10))})

will do what I think you want.

Subject: [R] a little questions
Message-ID: <200211191523.03726.chrysopa@insecta.ufv.br>

Hi all,
I have some little questions.

1)
I make a function, with list's help, for make a map, its work OK, 
but it show an extra output of this:

    lapply(split(dataset,dataset$trajectory),lfun)

Is possible to eliminate any text output from an function?

2) 
I try to put an equation on a object to use in curve for example,
but it don't work, it possible to make a object of an equation?

ex.

fx <- a + b*x
for(a in 0){for(b in 1){curve(fx,...)}}

3)
Exist in R any functions to estimate severals curves (non interactive) for a 
dataset?
Something like table-curve 2d.

Thanks
Ronaldo

explode : 
logical vector specifying slices of the pie which should be exploded (moved
out from the center). If this is shorter than x, it is reused cyclically.

Asunto: [R] plotting intersecting planes


Hi all

In two days, I am giving a small, informal workshop in our
Department about using R.  Initially, it was just for statistician,
but surprisingly (to me anyhow) many mathematicians are also
coming who have a MATLAB background.  They are coming at the
Workshop from a teaching perspective.

They are considering using R to avoid licensing issues with
MATLAB.  One thing they were hoping me to show them was some
3D plotting.  I have used  persp  and  image  and all.  But what
about, say, plottting intersecting planes?  I can't seem to find a
way of plotting in 3D, and then adding another plot.
I guess I am after a 3D equivalent of  lines  or  points;
one plots the original plot and then adds to it.

Ideally, this would be a simple task; we wouldn't want to have
our students mucking about too much to plot two planes intersecting.

Thanks as always.

P.

Nothing against R, but the GNU equivalent (more matrix oriented
etc) is Octave, which is as close to the emulation of MATLAB as
you can get.

Subject: [R] fexact.c
Message-ID: <200211191903.17253.rdiaz@cnio.es>

Dear All,

I am using fexact.c on a C++ program I wrote. To minimize dependencies on 
other files (e.g., to not need to include R.h and ctest.h ---now I only 
include the R files Boolean.h, Constants.h, and Memory.h), I have re-written 
all declarations of Sints as ints and, what is potentially more serious, I 
have re-written the line (lines 329 and 330, in fexact.c on R-1.6.1) 

 /* IMAX is the largest representable Sint on the machine. */
    const Sint imax = SINT_MAX;

as

    const Sint imax =  2147483647;


I have checked the program on an Intel machine (running Linux and compiled 
with gcc) and on an SGI machine running Irix 5.6 (compiled with gcc and, I 
think, using 32 bits), and so far all results are OK. However, I wonder if I 
am likely to run into problems because of my sloppy hack.

Thanks,

----- end file -----

Note: Spaces in the first column are real.

I would like to read in a data.frame containing only the data between:

" #
 #        Daily values:
 #"
and 
" #
 #       Minimum/Maximum values:
 #"

but the number of columns in the dataset will vary.  The information 
describing how it veries is contained in the sections:

" char    HillVarNames[ 3 ]
         {Days In Simulation}                         
         {Hillslope: Precipitation (mm)}              
         {Hillslope: Average detachment (kg/m**2)}"
and 

" char    OFEVarNames[ 3 ]
         {Irrigation depth (mm)}                      
         {Irrigation_volume_supplied/unit_area (mm)}  
         {Runoff (mm)}"

the number of columns is the sum of HillVarNames and OFEVarNames (6), and
the column labels are listed below.

Depending on options in the model run which generates this file, the number
of columns can change.  But I would like to write a function that reads the
file
and makes a data.frame with two columns, day and runoff, in this case columns
1 and 6 in the file.  If I can parse the variable names into a vector
I can determine which element has {Days In Simulation} and {Runoff (mm)} but
I am having trouble finding a function that will allow me to read in parts
of the
file and use information gathered along the way to direct additional reading.

The procedure I invision will look like this:

(1) skip first 9 lines
(2) read 3rd word in next line and assign to variable hillvarnames
(3) read hillvarnames more lines
(4) test which line has the value {Days In Simulation} and assign index to
daycolumn.
(5) skip 3 lines
(6) read 3rd word in next line and assign to variable ofevarnames
(7) read ofevarnames more lines
(8) test which line has the value {Runoff (mm)} and assign
index+hillvarnames to runoffcolumn.
(9) skip 3 lines
(10) read lines until 5 lines remain and assign the values in the daycolumn
and runoffcolumn columns to a data.frame with columns day and runoff.

Is this a reasonable thing to do in R?  Are there some functions that 
will make this task less difficult?  Is there a function that alows you to 
read a small amount of information, parse it, test it, and then begin reading 
again where it left off?

I am using the following R version:
         _              
platform i386-pc-mingw32
arch     i386           
os       mingw32        
system   i386, mingw32  
status                  
major    1              
minor    6.1            
year     2002           
month    11             
day      01             
language R              

Thank you in advance.

I believe there's also scilab (http://www-rocq.inria.fr/scilab/), which has
its own graphics.  Octave relies on gnuplot, if I'm not mistaken.

Nothing against R, but the GNU equivalent (more matrix oriented
etc) is Octave, which is as close to the emulation of MATLAB as
you can get.

Under Linux, use

#include limits.h
#define SINT_MAX INT_MAX

Don't have an SGI machine handy, so I've no idea if that'll work on Irix.

This looks possible in R, and your algorithm looks precise enough.
The help pages for file, readLines, and scan should cast some
light.

For jobs like this I tend to use Perl, however.  Familiarity
is one reason:  I'm more comfortable with Perl for scanning/parsing 
files.  Also, Perl was originally written for exactly this sort of
thing.

Cheers

Subject: [R] Another plot question
Message-ID: <000c01c29002$59c59310$2dfa7d41@simATE>

Here is another, perhaps trivial, plotting question.

I am making a filled contour plot and have almost everything dialed in
the way I want it. The last hurdle (that I can foresee) is adjusting the
look of the key. I'm plotting the 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% quantiles and I
want the key to be evenly spaced, e.g., the width of the 25% and the 95%
should look the same on the key. They are labeled and ticked right. Is
there a way to space them correctly?

Thank you all for being an outstanding user community,

Should I go with PostgreSQL for the option of Proxy Data Frames or should I

This function seems to work, on your sample file at least,

read.hill <- function (file)
{
    lines <- scan (file, what = "", sep = "\n", quiet = TRUE)
    ## Get the line starting with ' char'
    chars <- grep ("^ char", lines)
    ## Get the number of columns
    ncols <- get.numbers (lines[chars])
    ## Get the column labels
    labels <- lines[rep (chars, ncols) +
                    as.vector (sapply (ncols, seq, from = 1))]
    ##
    days.col <- grep ("Days", labels)
    runoff.col <- grep ("Runoff", labels)
    ## Get the numbers 
    toSkip <- grep ("Daily values", lines) + 1
    toRead  <- grep ("Minimum/Maximum", lines) - 2 - toSkip
    temp <- unlist (strsplit (lines[(toSkip+1):(toSkip+toRead)],
                              split = " +"))
    ## There are some "" at the first column
    temp <- matrix (temp, ncol = length (labels) + 1, byrow = TRUE)
    data.frame (days = as.numeric (temp[, days.col + 1]),
                runoff = as.numeric (temp[, runoff.col + 1]))
}

get.numbers () is a function that I wrote to extract numbers from a character
vector that match a certain pattern.

get.numbers <- function (ss, pattern, ignore.case = FALSE) {
    if (!missing (pattern)) {
        ss <- grep (pattern, x = ss, ignore.case = ignore.case,
                    extended = TRUE, value = TRUE)
    }
    if (length (ss) == 0) {
        return (NULL)
    }
    ## split at non numeric, non-dot characters and two or more dots
    ## FIXME: this is not the optimal split
    token <- strsplit (ss, split = "([^-+.0-9]|--+|\\+\\++|\\.\\.+| \t)")
    ## remove any trailing '.'
    token <- lapply (token, function (x) sub ("\\.$", "", x))
    ## remove empty strings and convert to numeric
    token <- lapply (token, function (x) {
        as.numeric (x[sapply (x, function (y) y != "")])
    })
    if (is.null (names (ss))) {
        names (token) <- ss
    } else {
        names (token) <- names (ss)
    }
    token
}

As Jason pointed out, Perl might be more suitable to this job.  However, I do
like using R to parse many weird files.  I find maintaining R scripts much
easier than Perl and it is often more convenient to read a file directly into
R. 

It would be nice to have more powerful regex in R, such as returning matched
substring grouped with "()".

Subject: [R] mem.tally.* in R
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0211191251510.16664-100000@socrates.Berkeley.EDU>

I'd like to use the resources() function described on p. 151-152 of S
Programming by Venables and Ripley (2000), but I don't have access
to S and don't know whether R's memory functions (e.g., gc()) can be used
instead of mem.tally.reset() and mem.tally.report(). In order to
implement the resources() function in R, should I look for the
C source for these S functions and wrap them in R or is there some way
to use R's memory functions in the base library?

Thanks!

I think you are overlooking the power of gsub.  You can certainly do that.

You can either use segments() or arrows() to add SE/CI lines to a
barplot().  

Or...

You can use barplot2(), which is in the gregmisc package on CRAN. It is
an enhanced version of barplot() that supports the above and other
features like log scaled axes, grid lines and more. If you go this route
and have any questions on barplot2(), let me know.

...by indicating that SciLab and Octave are available.  We actually
are aware of both, and have at times tried both.  R is being
considered as it possibly caters better for both the mathematics
and statistics courses in our Department, without having to support 
two packages (such as Octave *and* R).

Still, I am looking forward to any more possible solutions to the
original question, though Carlos Ortega suggested I search the
News archive.  The solution appears to be to use  scatterplot3d, 
which isn't with my R, so I'll have to grab it and have a look.

Ideally, a simpler solution is still preferred!

I want something like:

> REGEXFUN ("abc ([0-9]+)", "abc 30 and ABC 40 and abc 80")
[[1]]
[1] "30" "80"

I'm not sure how to achieve this with 'gsub'.

The best I can come up with is:

regex.match <- function (pattern, x) {
    a <- strsplit (gsub(pattern, "*| \\1 |*", x), split = "\\*")
    b <- lapply (a, function (x) x[grep ("^\\|.*\\|", x)])
    lapply (b, function (x) {
        temp <- unlist (strsplit (x, split = " *\\| *"))
        temp[temp != ""]
    })
}

> regex.match ("abc ([0-9]+)", "abc 30 and ABC 40 and abc 80")
[[1]]
[1] "30" "80"

It is unfortunately not quite useful and breaks down when there are two "()"
expressions or none, for instance.

> regex.match ("abc ([0-9]+) and ABC ([0-9+])", "abc 30 and ABC 40 and abc 80")
[[1]]
[1] "30"

It's not really a meaningful concept.  R does not use memory efficiently:
it leaves objects around until it runs short and then gc's.  So you can't
really find out the minimum amount of memory a task will take.

Fortunately these things are a lot less important than even in 1999.

Hi

It is possible to perform some simple annotations to 3D plots -- see the
examples in help(persp).  It is also possible to do some fancier things
(e.g., http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/luvhue.pdf,
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/hsvhue.pdf), even possibly
intersecting planes, but you have to do a lot of the work yourself and
you really have to know what you are doing, so this doesn't really come
under the heading of "simple solutions" :)

I'm afraid R does not currently have its own general-purpose
hidden-surface removal code so general-case 3D scenes via persp() are
just not possible.

Others have mentioned scatterplot3d;  depending on your platform, you
might also want to take a look at Duncan Murdoch's RGL package
(http://fisher.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/software/)

You'll probably need the RSJava package.  You'll find it at

http://www.omegahat.org/download/R/packages/

There are (at least) two:  the MPI and PVM interfaces, both of which
are on the contributed packages section of CRAN.

Hi,

 | Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2002 11:11:41 -0700
 | From: Corey Moffet <cmoffet at nwrc.ars.usda.gov>
 | 
 | I have a generated file that looks like the following:
 | 
 | ----- Begin file -----
 |  #
 |  #       Output File
 |  #
 |  float   Version      2002.700000000000

As I understand, you have generated the file yourself using a
different software.  In that case I strongly recommend to consider
using XML as the format of the data file.  It allows much more
flexible parsing and the changes in reading routines are simple if you
change the format of data.  Many programs have pre-programmed XML
parsers, among them R (package XML) and perl.  I have used XML with
success while transfering complicated estimation results from SAS and
GAUSS to R.

Just a suggestion.

I guess you want to check if a list has a certain *named* component?
Assume

   mylist <- list(ab = .., .....)

Then, you can use

   if(!is.null(mylist $ mycomp)) { .........}

or (not quite equivalently!)

   if("mycomp" %in% names(mylist)) { .........}

Does this answer the (little vague) question?

The nlme package fits multilevel models in R, and it has several plot methods 
that may be suitable. [There might be simpler ways if there's something 
specific you want to do.]

Has anybody written an actuarial (life) survival procedure, this does 
not appear to be an option in the survival package?
This approach is common in orthopaedic surgery to demonstrate the 
survival of prostheses.
I need to apply the "modified" lower conf.int because of the censoring 
over time.
I want a life table which I can then easily plot.

Here's a third interpretation of your question, to test whether somewhere 
is list there is an object identical to y:

any(sapply(list, function(x) identical(y, x)))

(You could, in addition, test whether there is an element named y in list, 
as Martin Maechler proposed.)

Does that do it?

I believe recent versions of R on Windows automatically set memory.limit to
the size of physical memory.  For instance, on my 512m machines a
plain-vanilla install of R 1.6.1 returns

> memory.limit()
[1] 536264704

Also note these recent changes :

http://www.r-project.org/nocvs/mail/r-announce/latest/0070.html

R-1.6.0 is released 

o Command-line flags to set memory can now use the suffix `G' 
        for gigabytes. The setting of maximum vsize is now only 
        limited by the platform's address space. 

o Internally memory sizes and counts of cons cells are now stored 
        in unsigned longs. This allows memory limits to be set and 
        objects created in the range 2-4Gb on 32-bit platforms, and 
        allows 64-bit platforms to use much larger amounts of memory.

Dear listers - I am trying to implement the SPLUS example for boostrapping 
coefficients from a linear model -

boot(data.frame, coef(eval(model$call)))

I get errors saying that my statistic is not defined and that the 
replicates are not defined.  Changing this to -

boot(recTTM, statisitic=coef(eval(mod$call)),R=999)

still gives the error about the statistic.  Clearly I do not understand 
what the statisitic is and how to make the coefficients a function as in 
the examples in the help... can someone guide me on syntax?

Here's a simple example.  As Paul Murrell said, though, there's no hidden
surface removal.

trans3d <- function(x,y,z, pmat) {                       # Thanks, Ben Bolker!
  tmat <- t(cbind(x,y,z,1) %*% pmat)
  list(x=tmat[1,]/tmat[4,], y=tmat[2,]/tmat[4,])
}

pmat <- persp(0:1,0:1,matrix(NA,2,2), xlim=c(-5,5), ylim=c(-5,5), zlim=c(0,2),
              theta=25, phi=30, expand=.5, xlab="X", ylab="Y", zlab="Z")

James Holtman and Marc Schwartz:

Thank you for your replies. I am slowly getting closer to the output I was 
hoping for.

Plotting a table:

Finally I used this method for plotting the text table:
# Drug table
## Print dates as DMY (otherwise printed as an integer)
ond <- as.date(ON)
offd <- as.date(OFF)
## Create plot region
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1) 
plot.new()
## Headings (Bold)
text(0,1,paste(?Start date?), adj=c(0,1), font=2)
text(0.3,1,paste(?Stop date?), adj=c(0.5,1) , font=2)
text(0.6,1,paste(?ARVs?), adj=c(0.5,1) , font=2)
## Plot data (double spaced)
text(0,0.85,paste(ond, collapse='\n\n'), adj=c(0,1))
text(0.3, 0.85,paste(offd, collapse='\n\n'), adj=c(0.5,1))
text(0.6, 0.85,paste(ARVS, collapse='\n\n'), adj=c(0.5,1))

After playing with the size of the columns, the result looks good.

I guess if you just reinstall R, it will overwrite the old
installation and everything works fine.

There is no automatic uninstall procedure if build from source.
However, there are different options to do it manually.

a) Check the package listing of a rpm.  For 1.5.1 you will see
something like
/usr/bin/R
/usr/lib/R/*
/usr/share/doc/R-base-1.5.1/*
/usr/share/doc/R-*
/usr/share/man/man1/R.1.gz
remove these files and directories.

b) install once more from source, but to a temporary directory
(e.g. configure --prefix=/tmp/R).  Look what files and directories are
created there and delete the corresponding ones in your real directory
tree.

If you need to make your own build, consider building your own RPM
(look www.rpm.org) instead.  You may "borrow" the spec-file from the
existing src.rpm and modify it, that should be the easiest way.

Perhaps it helps.

Subject: [R] Plots by subject
Message-ID: <3E2DA707@webmail.mcgill.ca>

Thomas,
Thank you for your reply about the for () loop. The as.character advice 
worked. Sorry for the delay in getting back to?I had to set the project aside 
for a few weeks.

This didn?t work exactly as is
for (patient in as.character(1:n)){
  pt <- MRN == patient
(rest of the function)
}

But this did
for (patient in as.character(levels(MRN))){
pt <- MRN == patient
(rest of the function)
}

What I didn?t mention last time was that the whole intended result is a sheet 
(one per patient) with a few graphs and tables:

(Used > nf <- layout(matrix(c(1,1,2,2,3,4),3,2,byrow=TRUE), c(1,1),c(7,3,3), 
FALSE) to section the page.)

The data are from 4 different dataframes (df) (one for each plot) and there 
are a variable number of lines for any given patient across the df (e.g. every 
patient has one line in the demographics df, but a patient may have 3 lines in 
the genotype df, 2 lines in the drug df (3 tables are plotted with the data 
from these three df) and 14 lines in the lab df (for the graph you helped me 
with).


So the whole function for one patient is:
{
# Overlay plot
lab <-read.xport('lab')
attach(lab)
celld <- as.date(CELLDATE)
vld <- as.date(VIRDATE)
gtd <- as.date(GTDATE)
par(mar=c(2,6,1,6) + 0.1)
plot(celld, T4, ylim=c(0,800), pch=4, type='o', ylab='CD4 count (cells/ul) 
[-x-]', xlab=??)
par(new=T)
plot(gtd, Y, ylim=c(0,800), type='p', pch=8, axes=F, ylab='', xlab='', 
cex=1.4)
par(new=T)
plot(vld, VL, axes=F, ylim=c(0,6), lty=5, ylab='', type='c', xlab='')

par(new=T)
plot(vld, VL1, axes=F, ylim=c(0,6), pch=1, lty=2, ylab='', type='p', xlab='', 
cex=1.4)
axis(4)

detach(arv)
}

When I use it in the loop (adding [pt] to the variable names, of course), I 
don?t get all the data?it skips lines in some tables or something. I don?t 
understand the mechanism behind ?for?, but it does not seem to just substitute 
in a value like in a SAS macro variable. So what I tried was making one big 
table (in SAS and replacing duplicated data with missing values?i.e. ?if not 
first.(variable) then (newvariable)=?.?, etc) so when there was more genotype 
entries than drug entries, for example, ?NA?s filled the corresponding drug 
data cells. This results, however, in a lot of  ?NA?s being printed in the 
table sections, since there are many lines of data for the graph data. 
Ccreating this big table was cumbersome, too.

Is there a way to create a loop when several data sources are being used? (Am 
I making any sense?) Or I thought I could put out a set df for each patient 
(e.g. arv1:arv(n); bl1:bl(n); etc) and use something like I &#61663; (1:193) 
and paste I into the import and attach commands. I don?t want to give up 
because I am really happy with the results when done one patient at a time so 
your continued help would so appreciated.

Thanks for your time!

Tanya

Not quite!

memory.limit only exists on Windows, and is not the same as --max-mem-size
(which you probably never need to set on Windows).

>From the CHANGES file for rw1060:

  The default memory limit has been raised to the smaller of 1Gb and the
  amount of physical RAM.  (See the changes for rw1040 and rw1020 below.)

I am not sure if this is what you want. The function lifetab in package
KMsurv creates a cohort life table as described in Klein and Moeschberger
(1997), Survival Analysis.

Try ?boot. There are some examples and good explanation of arguments
boot function needs. 

As for a simple explanation, in your case (with default parameters)
statistic must be a function of two arguments, first argument the data,
and second the vector of indices which define the bootstrap sample.  For
example let us say that our data is my.data, and we want to bootstrap
linear regression coefficients, where dependent variable is the first
column of my.data, and independent variables are the rest columns of
my.data. Then the call to boot function would be

boot(my.data,statistic=boot.fun,R=999),

where

boot.fun <-
function(data,ind) {
    coef(lsfit(data[ind,-1],data[ind,1],intercept=TRUE))
    #Note: we could use the lm, but if we only need the regression
    #coefficients, lsfit is faster
}

Hope it helps

Depends on what you mean.  Your subject line says "parallel", here you
say "concurrent".  Those are different.  Processes on a time sharing
single processor run concurrently; on a multiprocessor machine some of
them may run in parallel.

There are tools available for using R for parallel programming on a
cluster of workstations.  The rpvm and Rmpi packages available from
CRAN provide powerful low level facilities for this.  The package snow
available at www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/cluster/ provides a simpler,
higher level interface that is useful for many "embarassingly
parallel" applications.  snow runs on top of sockets, or rpvm, or
Rmpi.  snow is still udergoing changes in its basic design but should
stabilize and get submitted to CRAN within a month or so.

R does not currently allow multiple threads within a single R process.
It may eventually allow concurrent threads; it is unlikely that it
will ever allow parallel threads (for lots of reasons it will probably
always be necessary to make sure that at most one R thread is running
in the R internals at any given time).

Hi

I you've build the package with the default --prefix option
(/usr/local), you'll get a file called R in /usr/local/bin, a file
called R.1 in /usr/local/man/man1 and a directory also called R in
/usr/local/lib. Just delete them !

Regards

EJ

PS: If you rebuild it correctly with the same --prefix you can just
overwrite the old version, no problem !

Let's see?  boot is not part of R, but there is one in package boot.
However, S-PLUS does not come with boot at all.  I think you are
trying to use an example from the wrong package, perhaps for a
function called `bootstrap'?

The boot package and the book it supports (and MASS and the book it
supports) have plenty of examples of this, so why not follow them?
You do need to be aware of the difference beween bootstrapping
cases and bootstrapping residuals.  There's an example of the latter in
?boot.

My limited understand of Windows memory management is that it cannot handle
programs that are bigger than physical memory. Is my understanding correct, and
thus the reason for the above limit? For this and other reasons I have tended to
stick with Unix/Linux versions of R, and I am wondering if this should be seen
as a Windows limitation or a limitation imposed by R in Windows.

Thanks,
Paul Gilbert

No.  It has had virtual memory since ca 1990.

Windows is very slow at using more that the physical RAM, especially on
16-bit Windows (which 95/98/ME are for this purpose).  But it can do it.

The reason for the 1Gb limit is to do with the limited total space Windows
gives (2Gb or 3Gb across all processes).

Yes, Linux on the same machine handles large amounts of memory better.
But the gap is much less than it used to be.

Hi,
I have R installed in a system, but I need to install some packages as normal 
user on linux. Is possible to R use others library to get packages or one by 
one?

Ex.

I have some main package installed in /usr/lib/R/library

And now I need to install my own packages in ~/R/library

And I need to use the packages in main library and in my own library.

Its possible?
Thanks

if you are talking about atomic objects, is.element() and %in% may do what 
you are looking for:

 > 5 %in% 1:4
[1] FALSE
 > 3 %in% 1:4
[1] TRUE
 > is.element(3, as.list(1:4))
[1] TRUE
 > is.element(5, as.list(1:4))
[1] FALSE
 > 3 %in% as.list(1:4)
[1] TRUE
 > 5 %in% as.list(1:4)
[1] FALSE

For general objects (both atomic and non-atomic), I know of no better way 
than the one already suggested by John Fox:

 > LIST <- as.list(1:4)
 > X <- as.integer(3)
 > any(sapply(LIST, function(y,x) identical(y,x), X))
[1] TRUE
 >

The main problem with using identical() is that it is sensitive to the 
storage modes, which can lead to unexpected non-matches:

 > LIST <- as.list(1:4) # elements are integer
 > X <- 3 # a double value
 > any(sapply(LIST, function(y,x) identical(y,x), X))
[1] FALSE
 > identical(X, LIST[[3]])
[1] FALSE
 > X==LIST[[3]]
[1] TRUE
 > storage.mode(X)
[1] "double"
 > storage.mode(LIST[[3]])
[1] "integer"
 >

hope this helps,

Do you really mean a one-dimensional random walk ?

The sum of n independent N(0,1) variables is N(0, n), so if you are interested 
in only the endpoint, you might as well use that fact.

Your error is based on a misunderstanding of what the 'statistic' should
look like for the boot() function.  The statistic needs to take the data
as an argument and a vector of indices -- it is the indicies which get
resampled.  

I wrote a very simple package for bootstrapping in a few classical
situations, including linear models.  You can resample rows and residuals.
It's available at http://department.stat.ucla.edu/~rpeng/uclaboot.  The
interface is (in my opinion, of course!) a little easier to use than the
boot library.

There's an example in ?Startup with exactly this.

(Assuming that you are on Unix/Linux,) You can install libraries from source 
to anywhere you want by using the -l flag to R INSTALL, e.g.

R INSTALL -l ~/R/library <package>.tar.gz

You can load them inside R by 

library(package, lib.loc = "~/R/library")

(If you want to do this often, you might want to have a .Renviron file under ~ 
with the line

R_LIBS=~/R/library

in which case library() will search for a package there before looking in the 
system wide location.)

Thanks. I had in mind that it was "limited virtual" in the sense that multiple
programs could use more than physical memory, but any one program had to fit in
memory. I guess that is not technically true, but it sounds like it is almost
true for practical purposes.

Does Windows (2000/XP) impose this limit even if there is more physical memory?

Message-ID: <001501c290d7$782d5380$d97e27d9@btopenworld.com>

Is anyone aware of a library or package to estimate cointegrating systems by
FIML (Johansen, 1988)?
I know there is small amount of code on Prof Koenker's site, I wondered if
anyone has done the rest, and could save me a little effort.

Many thanks

put quotation marks before and after your file name: e.g. you want to save
it as xxxx.r, then you should input it as "xxxx.r".

hope it helps.

Subject:    [R] FW: using R under windows


 I am used to using R under unix. I have a problem with R
 under Windows-2000:
 Suppose I have a plain text file code.r full of R code
 that I want to source into R. My problem is that Windows
 invisibly tacks ".txt" onto the end of the filename (the name
 looks like code.r but it is really code.r.txt). How to get
 windows to both allow me to call it code.r (for real! Not
 code.r.txt) and to edit it as a text file by default (say
 with Notepad)?

BTW is there any way to get Windows to stop its fiddling with the filename
extensions?
If I call something file.txt it appears as file (although the real name is
file.txt)

 Thanks for any help.

The 32-bit address space limit is 4Gb.  Of that Windows NT reserves
address space of 1Gb for itself in Server versions, 2Gb in workstation
versions.  Or so the docs say.

The limits of 32-bit addressing are beginning to hit home, which is why
the major workstation manufacturers went to 64-bit long ago.  (Even my
1997 Sun can run 64-bit address spaces.)

In the explorer go to the extras->folder options->views tab (translated from
german, might not match exactly). There you can uncheck "hide extensions of
known file-types".

Beside that you might change your text-editor, notepad always fiddles around
with the extensions. Try texpad with the s-plus code-color-scheme or winedt
with the r-macros. Both really nice.

I believe under the 'save as' menu, if you select file type to be 'all
files', Windows will not try to outsmart the user w/ the selection of file
extensions.

Subject: [R] Defining/Checking constants in packages
Message-ID: <200211202139.PAA15930@definetti.uark.edu>


In a package I am writing I need to use the constant pi (3.14..., that
is) which is already defined in R. However, how can I make sure the
user has not changed its value before loading the package? 
If this happened, is a reference to `pi' in the package going to use
the user-defined value or the value defined in base?
I thought I could solve the issue by including the following line in
my package
   pi <- get("pi", pos=grep("package:base",search()))
but then when I load the package R warns me about masking issues. 
What is the recommended way of dealing with this issue?

Thank you in advance,
Giovanni

When saving the file under Notepad, change the file type to "All files" so 
that Notepad doesn't screw with the extension. Alternatively, you could use 
a better editor, such as WinEdt or Emacs (there's information on the R 
website at <http://cran.r-project.org/other-software.html>).

  John

Message-ID: <3DDC03FC.6050300@fe.up.pt>

Dear list readers,

This question is concerned with the use of the chisq.test() in R.
A test was conducted to determine the difference between 2 samples A and 
B. Column I consisted of correct and incorrect assessment of  30 matched 
pairs (AA or BB) , whereas column II consisted of correct and incorrect 
assessment of  30 unmatched pairs (AB or BA). This example is given in a 
book on the sensory evaluation techniques. The author's did not use 
Yate?s correction for continuity  in their analysis of the data.
I am trying to decide whether Yate?s correction for continuity should be 
used when analysing a 2x2 contigency table using the chi-square test. I 
have found conflicting views in literature with some people for and 
others against.  The analysis with or without Yate?s correction gives 
conflicting results.

 > x <- matrix(c(17, 13, 9, 21), nc = 2)
 > chisq.test(x,correct = TRUE)

        Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction

data:  x
X-squared = 3.3258, df = 1, p-value = 0.0682

 > chisq.test(x,correct = F)

        Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  x
X-squared = 4.3439, df = 1, p-value = 0.03714

 >

The same data analysed using Fisher's exact test is similar to the 
chi-square with Yate?s correction
 > fisher.test(x)

        Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

data:  x
p-value = 0.06728
alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
  0.9354766 10.1716022
sample estimates:
odds ratio
  2.992580

I suppose looking at the results, the correct conclusion should be taken 
using the correction for continuity. In fact, the statistics books I 
have read suggest the use of  Yate?s correction for continuity. (for 
example, Nonparametric statistics - Sidney Siegel and John Castellan 1988)

I would like to hear anyone's view on this, especially statisticians.


Thanks in advance

Peter

More you need to tell us how you get Windows to add the extension.
I think the solution is to use a real editor: NTemacs, Xemacs, PFE, ....
(WinEdt if you want to pay for it.)

BTW, R can source("foo.r.txt").

It hides them in Explorer (but that's a tiny part of Windows).  Go to
Folder Options, View, untick `Hide extensions for known file types'.
Surely you can find some local advice on such things?

Message-ID: <TN1W63JFVQ3X85XTZ15YLGQKRIG1Z.3ddc1140@a187037>

Hi all,

I have created a new edit mode file for the editor JEdit (http://www.jedit.org) based on the file from Zed Shaw. The difference between 
his and my file is that mine can be used as a spell checker. It does not highlight all functions but provides syntax highlighting for the base 
package (keyword types 1 and 2) and 26 additional packages (boot, class, cluster, ctest, eda, foreign, grid, KernSmooth, lattice, lqs, 
MASS, methods, mgcv, modreg, mva, nlme, nls, nnet, rpart, spatial, splines, stepfun, survival, tcltk, tools, ts) (keyword type 3). The data 
files of these packages are highlighted, too.

For people who like an automatic spell check for keywords and functions while typing the new file provides an alternative to Zed's.
You can download both files (Zed's and mine) here: http://community.jedit.org/.

Happy coding,

Tobias.

Hi Tobias,

thanks for the hint. Do you have experience how JEdit compares to other
R-capable editors like e.g. WinEdt? Does it offer something like WinEdt's
integration with the Windows R-gui?

Betreff: [R] Improving R Editing: New JEdit Edit Mode for R


Hi all,

I have created a new edit mode file for the editor JEdit
(http://www.jedit.org) based on the file from Zed Shaw. The difference
between
his and my file is that mine can be used as a spell checker. It does not
highlight all functions but provides syntax highlighting for the base
package (keyword types 1 and 2) and 26 additional packages (boot, class,
cluster, ctest, eda, foreign, grid, KernSmooth, lattice, lqs,
MASS, methods, mgcv, modreg, mva, nlme, nls, nnet, rpart, spatial, splines,
stepfun, survival, tcltk, tools, ts) (keyword type 3). The data
files of these packages are highlighted, too.

For people who like an automatic spell check for keywords and functions
while typing the new file provides an alternative to Zed's.
You can download both files (Zed's and mine) here:
http://community.jedit.org/.

Happy coding,

Tobias.

Under Windows, I have been using ConTEXT as my editor. This is a 
freeware program I found at http://www.fixedsys.com/context/. I wrote 
an R highlighter for it that works pretty well. I can send this to 
anyone who's interested.

Subject: [R] compiling R from source for windows
Message-ID: <DPEGLJCAOBGCLOPLBMMOMEAKCDAA.jmarsland_uk@yahoo.co.uk>

I have been using R for some time now and decided to have a go a compiling R
from source.

I have carefully followed the guidelines set out by Prof Ripley and others,
but I get the following message when I try to make:

	MkRules:92: *** missing separator.  Stop.

If I comment the line out, I get the same message for the next line.

I have searched on Google and many people have mentioned an issue with make
about spaces vs. tab marks, but this doesnot seem to be the problem.

I am working with Windows NT and trying to compile R version 1.6.1, can
anybody help?

Regards,

John Marsland

Most kinds of Linux use some sort of binary package like rpm.
Several of those are available on CRAN, specifially
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux

If you can do that, "going through" sounds harsh.  You download
the rpm file and give one command, such as rpm -Uvh r-base...rpm
and you are done.  If you have some version of Linux other than
Debian, Mandrake, RedHat, or Suse, then you need to compile R
from the source, as you would do on Unix.

>How do I update packages?

Start R as root and type
update.packages()
See the help about update.packages for the various options.

In general you use Yates' correction if you want the results to be conservative as with Fisher's "exact" test.  I generally use the chi-square test without continuity correction.  The price of "exact" tests (those that guarantee the type I error is no greater than a set value) is conservatism.  I prefer tests that get closest to the target alpha value even if they exceed it a little bit on occasion.

This kind of question would be slightly more appropriate for the sci.stat.consult Usenet news group.

Subject: [R] RArcInfo:  can't read arc coverage
Message-ID: <200211210052.gAL0qXd06672@tuff.pnl.gov>

I am having trouble using get.arcdata() in RArcInfo.  X and y coordinates

When I execute the following and do a plotarc() or look at the lists containing the
x and y coordinates, all I see is garbage--the coordinates are all infinitesimal or
extremely large numbers (e.g., -8.928678e-31, 9.784083e+15).  

stdir6 <- get.arcdata("/projects/cold_creek/grid/watershed/dhsvm_200m", "stdir_6", filename="arc.adf")
plotarc(stdir6, new=T)
stdir6[[2]]

On the advice of Virgilio, I converted my Arc v.8x coverage into v.7x, but
that made no difference (ESRI documenation says they should be the same anyway).

Message-ID: <001401c290f8$c1afac80$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

If you add

# Allows conflicts. For more information, see library() and
# conflicts() in [R] base.
.conflicts.OK <- TRUE 

to your package you will not get a warning with masking objects when
your package is loaded. I normally include this line in a file named
zzz.R in which one normally also add functions as .First.lib() etc.

Otherwise there are no way to specify (final) constants in R. The new
support for name spacing, as Deepayan Sarkar mention in the other email,
will solve some of these problems. However, a common coding convention
between programmers could also prevent a lot of these problems. For
instance, using the widely used naming convention that constants have
only captial letters, e.g. PI, and (changing) variables not, would
minimize the risk for redefinition of its value. Of course, it could
still be that different programmers defines PI differently. For *my own
and my collegues* purposes, I am trying to define such a coding
convention for minimizing mishaps like the one you describe. It can be
found on http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/RCC/, but note that is under
construction(!).

Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.44.0211201653330.56998-100000@homer31.u.washington.edu>

hi, there.

Here is my problem. I have a data frame by read.table(). I want to take
every row from this data frame and compute the correlation between the
current row and a fixed vector. finally I want to append the correlation
computed as a column to the data frame.

this is what i am doing.
df<-read.delim("filename", col.names=v)
myv<-c(....)#this is my vector that I need to compute cor with
corv<-cor(t(df[,c(..)]), myv, use="complete.obs") #only use c(..) in df

the values I got from corv doesnt seem to be right when I tried to verify
them. the way i am doing this is probably not very smart or totally wrong.
Can someone help?

thanks very much.

Thanks for the info. Did not mean to sound harsh at all, R is an absolute 
pleasure to install and use---didn't think that "going through" is associated 
primarily with a negative emotion. Did a quick check on "going through" in 
poetry to see nuances of the phrase---you are right, except "going through 
life". Thanks for the reply.

Perhaps the following would do the trick.

df$corv <- apply(df,1,function(x) cor(x,myv,use="complete.obs"))

This might do what you want.

fixvec<-c(2,4,3,5,4,6,5,7,6,8)
test.df<-data.frame(matrix(sample(1:9,100,replace=T),ncol=10))
test.df<-data.frame(test.df,cors=apply(as.matrix(test.df),1,cor,fixvec))

Did you edit MkRules?  If you do, use an editor that respects tabs (and
apparently WinEdt is a culprit here).  Line 92 starts with a tab, so that
*does* seem to be the problem.  Note the warning in line 2 of the file.

How did you unpack the sources?  This sort of message often indicates the
use of the shareware WinZip (which corrupts files with amazing frequency
even when used to unzip).  I have got used to asking if WinZip is used
whenever files appear to have been corrupted.

Subject: [R] taking rows from a data frame
In-Reply-To: <3DDC44F2.8040206@colorado.edu>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0211210752020.13895-100000@gannet.stats>

Let's be careful.  You cannot in general compute the correlation between
`a row of a data frame and a vector'.  The columns of a data frame can be
of different types, so this is only possible if they are all numeric (or
integer or complex).  It would be better to use a matrix, and that is what
apply does implicitly (as.matrix).  However, it would be safer to do the
conversion yourself and check you get a numeric matrix back.

Contrast data.matrix() and as.matrix() and consider which you want.

If the matrix has many rows there are more efficient ways to do this via
matrix operations.

Subject: [R] boot vs. bootstrap summary
In-Reply-To: <TN1W63JFVQ3X85XTZ15YLGQKRIG1Z.3ddc1140@a187037>
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20021121090444.00affb70@falloch.stir.ac.uk>

Dear listers -

Thanks to all for the insight and help on defining the statistic term in 
the boot() function from the boot library in R - it "obviously" differs 
from the bootstrap function in SPLUS - hence my question about translating 
the syntax from the SPLUS example to R - but what i did not realize is that 
the boot library exisits in SPLUS as well.  Many thanks to those who took 
the time to explain the syntax to me... the list, as usual, was most 
helpful (even for the incesant reminders to try ?boot (how could I have 
known about the statisitic portion of boot without looking at that?).

Prof Ripley suggested reading the help more closely and examples in 
Venables and Ripley's MASS book which I did not realize covers the boot 
library as well... my oversight - its page 175 in the 3rd edition for 
linear models.

John Fox suggested his R and S-PLUS Companion which has an on-line appendix 
on bootstrapping regression models that might be of help. You can find it 
(and other appendices) at 
<http://www.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/appendix.html>.

Angelo Cany provided this advice
...statistic must be an R function (not an expression) and must
take 2 arguments, the original data and a vector of indices defining
the bootstrap replicate.  Your second error is that the number of
bootstrap replicates does not have a default (deliberately so) and
you must specify the number required.

Your example could be done as follows assuming that you want row
resampling.   Let data.model be the original lm fit.
bootcoef <- function(data, i, model) {
     coef(update(model, data=data[i,]))
}
boot(data.frame, statistic=bootcoef,R=999, model=data.model)

And Roger Peng, noting as all others did my confusion (inability to 
uderstand the ?boot text - hence my post) with the statistic term in 
boot(), said:

I wrote a very simple package for bootstrapping in a few classical
situations, including linear models.  You can resample rows and residuals.
It's available at http://department.stat.ucla.edu/~rpeng/uclaboot.  The
interface is (in my opinion, of course!) a little easier to use than the
boot library.

Hope these are of help to others.

cheers

source will do this, as it does in S-PLUS (whereas scripts only exist in
S-PLUS for Windows).

Subject: [R] Is R a good choice for this?
Message-ID: <000801c2914e$72a09b80$198314ac@sanostra.es>

  Hi.
  I'm working in a project about web-users behaviour analysis. In a few
words, it consists on:

- log-files recopilation and pre-analysis
- basic stadistics extraction (pages most visited, session lengths, etc.)
and on-line report generation in a web-viewable format
- more advanced analysis for web-users characterization

  The purpose of my project is implementing my own data analysis, so I don't
want to use commercial closed log-analysis tools; I need a tool for doing
all this work: basically data analysis and filtering; and on-line
web-reports generation.

  I don't know R language AT ALL, so do you think it would be a good choice?
What other related packages would I need?
  Do you know other Open Source alternatives?

  Thanks a lot and please excuse my poor English :)


PS: I'm not subscribed to the mailing list, so please reply me to

Hi Daniel,

I have never tried out WinEdit but after reading your message I took a quick glance at their homepage. It would not be useful for JEdit to 
implement the provided interaction with R-GUI since JEdit has to work on several platforms. But creating a button or shortcut for 
sending a complete file  / line / selection of code to R (the command line version) via pipe and to get back the result into JEdit shouldn't 
really be a problem. JEdit has a powerful macro language providing support for such things.

Best regards, Tobias.

Dear listers,

xyplot(pixel~day|Dog, groups=Side, data=Pixel, panel=panel.superpose, panel.groups=panel.xyplot, type="b", pch=16)
(I know, there are better examples, ...)
Now, how could I change the colours of the symbols accordingly to another factor changing within subject and side form time to time? (let us say Pixel$Fever<-sample(rep(0:1,51)))

Thanks in advance,

Jun,
Thank you for this information. It is half of what I wanted as there  
are no confidence limits calculated.
Survfit in the survival package gives very useful alternatives for  
calculating the confidence limits including adjustments to the lower  
limits, for data that is heavily censored (see Dorey and Korn as  
referenced in the survfit documentation). On the other hand,  
unfortunately survfit does not offer an actuarial method.
It looks as though I am going to have to write my own code for this.

Dear Steve,

I'll post your question also to the R-help mailing list since I think
this can help to other RArcInfo users.

As I mentioned in the last release of the package, I have a tutorial
nearly finished. I hope to release it in the next days.

> I have downloaded an .e00 file of 2000 Census Tracts for the southern US

I've looked for the data you mentioned and I have downlowaded from 
http://www.census.gov . It's a nice set of data. :D


Actually, the procedure is always the same. If you have an E00 file, you
fist must convert into a binary coverage (using 'eootoavc'), and then
read it with read.coverage or file by file.

I have downloaded a file called tr13_d00_e00.zip and unziped it. The
E00 file is tr13_d00.e00. Here you have an small example.

Please, notice that if your file is different, the steps to follow are
the same. The output messages will be a bit different, but that's
because I use a version which hass not been released yet, but don't
worry about it.

Dear R-ers:

I'm sorry to disturb you again: suppose that you have data in R , you 
write fix(data), and you get a window editor with this data, my 
question is if I can save this data as file in other program or on 
Diskette. or export this data to mijn disc 

if I use the command write.table(data), R only list this data thus 
write.table(data) is not the appropriate command i think so?

Thank you very much

Dear Hicham,

Take a look at the help page for write.table, which writes a data frame to 
an ascii file (though not via the data editor).

Brian probably meant to use envir=NULL or pos="package:base".  Using
envir=.GlobalEnv is equivalent to just

	> pi
	[1] 3.141593

which is subject to masking by loaded packages and assignments to
.GlobalEnv.  base::pi is equivalent to

	> get("pi", pos="package:base")
	[1] 3.141593

or

	>  get("pi", envir=NULL)
	[1] 3.141593

To expand on Brian's point, even if you did assign a value to pi in
your package that would only prevent masking by packages loaded prior
to yours.  Your functions are defined in the global environment, so
their globals are looked up in the global environment, the search
list, and then base.  If a package that does pi<-3 is loaded after
yours or if the user makes such an assignment at top level, then the
value your package gets for pi is 3.  Using base::pi in the current R
or get("pi", pos="package:base") is safer.

Within a month the development version of R should have a name space
mechanism that allows a package to explicitly specify which other
packages it uses (imports); functions in a package using this
mechanism will be defined in an environment that searches the package
itself, explicit imports (if any), and then base before .GlobalEnv and
attached packages.  This insures that attaching packages and assigning
into .GlobalEnv will not be able to mask definitions used in your
code.

As of 1.6 the base package is already defined in a name space, so any
functions in base that use pi will see the definition in base;
redefining pi in a loaded package or at top level cannot affect these
functions.

Subject: [R] Distance between points and a polygon?
Message-ID: <3DDCFE1A.9060508@eg.umu.se>

Dear R users,

I know that this could easily be solved within a GIS-package, but 
sometimes it's more convenient to use R. So here's my question anyway...

Does anyone of you know about any R-functions/code that calculates the 
distance between a number points and a polygon or polyline? I have 
looked thru the different libraries that deals with spatial statistics 
but haven't found anything.

Thanks,

Thanks for all the helpful replies both to the list and emailed directly to
me.

Several people blamed Notepad (I am looking at alternative suggested
editors) for tacking ".txt" onto filenames. However I experience this
problem with every other sort of file:
.pdf
.doc
.ps
.rtf

I have turned off the hidden names stuff as instructed in the file browser.
Doesn't seem to change anything. "file.pdf" is still shown as "file". I have
to guess from the icon that the real filename is "file" + ".pdf". Or if it
is a big W[ord] icon I have to guess that the filename is "file" + ".doc"
(though sometimes maybe it's really + ".rtf" or ".txt")
Maybe from now on the problem won't happen--just previously saved files
still have the hidden extensions.

In general it seems that I am not allowed to use extensions because windows
reserves the right to do that itself (something like the Mac's resource
fork). Else I need to play guessing games about filenames.

I know this is not R-specific but I am getting helpful R-specific advice
(e.g. WinEdt and JEdit R stuff). Thanks again for all the help. Looks like I
may have to dual boot linux because there is no solution to the windows file
extension fiddling.

Doesn't seem to work for me:

[1] 0

Now, that might be because I've redefined 'get':

 > get
function(x,pos=y){0}

:)

  So maybe if I am scared someone has redefined 'pi', I should also be 
paranoid about them redefining 'get'. However, I cant use:

get("get", pos="package:base")

  because my 'get' is already poisoned. So how can I reliably get the 
'get' in package:base:

 > base::get("pi",pos="package:base")
[1] 3.141593

?

Subject: [R] Calling R from Java
Message-ID: <4E2263D8-FD6E-11D6-9B43-003065E01564@pasteur.fr>

As Jason Turner told you, one possibility is to use the communication 
interface SJava  (for another documentation, see this article: Urbanek, 
S. (2002)
"No need to talk to strangers - Cooperation of Interactive Software with 
R as Moderator",   
http://simon.urbanek.info/simon/yawe/research/pub.html) but it seems not 
so easy to use (but if you want to do sophisticated things from what 
I've heard you should use SJava).

Here are other alternatives that are easy to implement and that you 
should consider depending on what you want to do:

1- one is to use R in batch mode ie you create a file in your java code 
with all the R commands and send it to R (via Process 
pc=Runtime.getRuntime().exec(Rcall); )and then R creates an outputfile 
with all the results.
The matter with this is that there is no interactivity, variables are 
not kept, you have to parse the outputfile, ... (see the above article 
(see ? FFinterface))

2- another one is to use the R server developed by Simon Urbanek:

http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve/

A java frontend is provided with the server, which allows to communicate 
easily with R and which sends back results in a java object. So for each 
connection to the server you have a R environment where all the variable 
generated are kept until you close the connection and from you java code 
it is as simple as this example: REXP mean = 
c.eval("mean"+i+"<-apply("+data+"[,data.cl=="+(i-1)+"],1,mean.na)");

This is what I'am using in my application and I am quite satisfied with 
it.


Hope this helps,

Laetitia.

The following seems to work in Windows 98--I don't know about 2000.
Use my computer to open a directory.
click "view" then "folder options" and go to the "view" tab
uncheck "hide file extensions for known file types"
click reset all folders
answer yes when it asks you if you really want to do that
click ok

Reversing this (checking the "hide file extensions...") seems to produce
the problem you describe and unchecking it seems to cure it. If you can't
find that box immediately on opening the view tab, click on the folders to
open them.

Hi Bill,

You assume that Windows is being a little more restrictive than it
actually is.  Windows has another option you can set

Hide extensions of known file types,

in the same place as the other options you changed.  Windows assumes
that you don't need to know that the extension of a pdf file is .pdf
because IT knows that Acrobat(reader) is used to open it, or some other
pdf reader you might have installed.  You should be able to tell what
the extensions are by looking at the icons if you need to know this...

...not very helpful is it?  This is on of the first "features" I turned
off after recently re-installing Windows on my desktop at work.

I'm sure you'll find Windows a bit more "useful" if you turn of these
kinds of handholding.  So you don't have to dual boot if you don't want
to!

Thanks for the reply Frank.

I will in future send these types of questions to sci.stat.consult 
Usenet news group, of which I was not previously aware of.
The interersting point about the two results, is the fact that the null 
hypothesis is not rejected using Yate's correction, but is rejected 
without Yate's correction. at 5% level of significance. I guess this 
will be better answered in sci.stat.consult .

Thanks again

Is there an easy way to "sink" text output to a pdf file using the pdf()
device?

Here's an email that describes setting up empty graphics plots and then
using the "text" command to put text on page:
http://www.r-project.org/nocvs/mail/r-help/2002/5598.html

I'm just looking for something a little more polished -- automatic page
breaks, line wrapping, etc.

Subject: [R] Analysis of Data with Observation Weights Revisited
Message-ID: <58CAB2332C0DD511BC7900A0C9EA316D013D17F0@dasmtyjqf009.amedd.army.mil>

In lm and glm, the weights command should only be used when the variances of
the observations are inversely proportional to the weights.

Recently, however, a question came up regarding how one could estimate lm
and glm models with weights where the weights refer to number of
observations (counts).

Because lm and glm do not handle this case, SE values will be wrong if one
uses the weight command with counts.  Notice that the SE values in the
second model are larger than those in the first model, though paramater
estimates are identical.

The thread left off with Thomas Lumley recommending that one use gee to
estimate the SE values while sticking with the parameter estimates from the
weighted lm or glm model.  Specifically something like,

mod<-gee(y1~x1,id=1:5, weights=w) #were each observation has its own id.

The problem with this solution is that gee does NOT allow weights (probably
something that would be fairly simple to modify); thus, the gee option
doesn't really work.

For those who are interested, one work around is to use the Thomas Lumley's
infjack.glm function in the glmerrs.R file at
http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/glmerrs.R
and the code is all in the WEAVE package at
http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/weave.html

In the example, notice that the SE estimates are much closer to the SE
values in the original model without weights.

> model<-glm(y1~x1,weights=w)
> varmat<-infjack.glm(model, groups=1:5)
> se<-sqrt(diag(varmat))
> se
(Intercept)          x1 
  0.7827224   0.4969040

Hi, Kevin.

In my view, the answer to your question depends, at least in part, on
what you want to use the pdf file for.

You may find that the conventional way of creating a pdf file with mixed
text and graphics is to use LaTeX.  You can then either output your
graphics from R in LaTeX format, or write them directly to pdf, which
you then import into your LaTeX document (a technique that seems to
produce very nice results).  You can then render your LaTeX document in
pdf. To do publication-quality stuff, this is almost certainly your best
bet.

If your text consists of tabular information, you may be able to do
something like: render the graphics into some convenient format such as
png or jpg; output your tables in HTML; merge the two; render the lot
into pdf. But you may struggle coming to the quality of rendering that
publications would require.


While your first effort may not satisfy your "easy" criteria, it gets
better with experience.

Regards,

Mike

Hey all R-gurus,

I'm trying to find a way to represent the "per mille" symbol in my axis
labels.  It looks like the percent sign but has two zeros in the
denominator (in case I have the name wrong!)

I took a look at example(Hershey) (which are delightful) but it wasn't
there.

Thanks for any suggestions!

  Here's something I hacked up a while ago to put a text box onto a 
figure.  It uses a crude line-breaking algorithm.  Hope it helps.

  Ben Bolker

## think about: justification etc.
## FIXME: specifying x length (and allowing it to be in inches or
##  user parameters) would make putting text boxes on logarithmic
## scales much easier ...
## FIXME: resets par(adj)
textbox <- function(x,y,textlist,justify=TRUE,cex=1,
                    leading=0.5,
                    box=TRUE) {
  ## basic strategy: break textlist into words, add words until
  ## length is right
  par(adj=0)
  textstr <- paste(textlist,collapse=" ")
  words <- strsplit(textstr," ")[[1]]
  line.height <- strheight("hy",cex=cex)*(1+leading)
  x.len <- diff(x)
  y.pos <- y
  x.pos <- x[1]
  curword <- 1
  while (curword < length(words)) {
    curline <- ""
    ## add first word
    curline <- paste(curline,words[curword])
    curword <- curword+1
    while (x.pos+strwidth(paste(curline,words[curword]),cex=cex)<x[2]) {
      curline <- paste(curline,words[curword])
      curword <- curword+1
    }
    text(x.pos,y.pos,curline)
    y.pos <- y.pos - line.height
  }
  if (box) rect(x[1],y+line.height,x[2],y.pos)
}

I guess I should have emphasize the word "easy" in the original post.  I am
aware of Sweave and have used it to produce terrific quality output, but it
takes quite a bit of effort to get that quality (setting up tex document,
erasing previous graphics, running the script, tex'ing the output, etc).

HTML code with separate graphic images seems even more work.

I was hoping for a non-presentation quality way to dump both graphics and
text straight from R into pdf file using the pdf() device.  Something akin
to the way a Mathematica or Maple session looks like.

Wouldn't it be nice, for example, to fit a linear model, then send both the
residual plots and the anova table straight to the PDF file for easy storage
in a single document?  Doesn't need to need to be fancy.

The idea of a Mathematica-style transcript session is quite appealing to me
the more I think about it, but might be too-much work for the R community to
create.  Even the commercial software S-Plus lacks such reporting
capabilities.  Think--"summary" methods could produce text AND graphics--an
intriguing idea.

You cannot, at least not directly. The usual trick is to define your groups 
variable according to what you want. In this case, maybe something like

newG <- paste(as.character(Pixel$Side), as.character(Pixel$Fever))

will work as the groups argument. If the resulting color scheme is not to your 
liking, you could specify a col vector that would correspond to 
levels(factor(newG)).

In this case however, you seem to want the lines to be drawn according to one 
grouping, and the points to be colored according to another. This would not 
be that simple. But it could be done if you modify panel.superpose slightly 
to accept another grouping variable (hint: you have to use the subscripts 
argument, and probably use the fact that panel.xyplot accepts a vector 'col' 
argument.)

Thanks Rolf,

The necessary function do indeed exists in the spatstat package, but 
rather well hidden I would say.
But after looking thru the bdist.points code I came up with this example:

> library(spatstat)
  #Define a matrix with all the points
> points<-matrix(c(1,3,3,3,6,3),3,2,byrow=T) 
  #Define a matrix with the points the polyline consists of

  #Returns the minimun distance for each point to the polyline
> apply(distppll(points,cbind(pl[-nrow(pl),],pl[-1,])),1,min)

HTML output is not all that far-fetched. Or perhaps XML. We could in
principle have all our print methods replaced by HTML output methods
(we might need to exercise a little more discipline to get rid of
explicit cat() and print() statements, but I'm not even sure that is
necessary). The default output method could simply be a plaintext
wrapper, like the HTML

<pre><kbd>
...
</kbd></pre>

and we could have some fairly obvious alignment structures for
vectors, arrays, tables, etc. It's not an afternoon's work, but it's
definitely doable. (And I wouldn't be too surprised if someone was
already playing with the idea...)

actually, the ESS noweb mode facilitates a great deal of this
production.  Combine it with an appropriate makefile, and document
construction (and verification of the results) is pretty trivial.

I recognize that we need to make tools like xtable cleaner to use (not
easier, just cleaner IMHO), and ESS needs to provide template
insertion for figures (and xtable runs).  That is coming.

The figures issue might be more critical -- I should probably figure
out the right incantation for the standard plot methods which produce
multiple figures...

Again, it's a fairly small step for the ESS interface; mostly template
construction and the issues raised above.  We are thinking about it!

Hi All,

Just installed R on my powerbook G4 (Darwin; see more info below) but 
have trouble with the the Search Engine and Keywords html page after 
help.start() (with Mozilla 5.0).  I've browsed the archives and have 
seen some references to similar problems, but can't figure out how to 
fix it so that the search function works.  When attempting to search 
for help using a keyword, nothing appears to happen; I'm still left 
looking at the Search Engine page.  The keywords by topic links don't 
work either.  Suggestions appreciated.

Subject: [R] Need help with pipe()
Message-ID: <3DDDB57F.98D9E1B4@cornell.edu>

Hello.

I have an R program that calls gawk (GNU Awk 3.06 for Windows) from
within pipe() to preprocess a large file before it is read into a data
frame with read.table().

I've recently upgraded from Win98SE to WinXP, and have also upgraded
from R1.5.0 to R1.6.1 over the past month or so. This program worked
before the upgrade(s), but now fails. I observe the following sort of
behavior with R1.6.1 under WinXP:

> cat("hello\ngoodbye\n",file="textfile")
> readLines("textfile")
[1] "hello"   "goodbye"
> readLines(pipe("gawk '{print $0}' textfile"))
character(0)
#  Note: R pauses for about 10 seconds before returning "character(0)"
> readLines(pipe("echo hello"))
Error in readLines(pipe("echo hello")) : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
cannot open cmd `echo hello'

gawk is in my system path, and I can successfully run it from a command
window.

Hence, I have the following questions:

(1) Is pipe() supported in R1.6.1 under WinXP?
(2) Can anyone suggest how to get pipe("gawk...") to work again?

Thanks,

Ronnen.

P.S. E-mailed cc:s of replies posted to the list would be appreciated.

Your example works for me on R 1.6.1 (the binary on CRAN) and Windows XP.

Pipes do work differently on Windows NT and 16-bit Windows (95/98/ME),
but they generally work better on NT.  (XP is the marketing name
for NT5.1.)

 |   Hi.
 |   I'm working in a project about web-users behaviour analysis. In a few
 | words, it consists on:
 | 
 | - log-files recopilation and pre-analysis
 | - basic stadistics extraction (pages most visited, session lengths, etc.)
 | and on-line report generation in a web-viewable format
 | - more advanced analysis for web-users characterization

I would recommend perl (or rexx) for the first task.  R is basically a
vector-oriented programming language with its text-file analysis and
parsing possibilities, and a large number of statistical functions.
You can definitely do everything with text files in R too, but it is
perhaps faster and more straightforward in perl.

If you already have the data in a easily readable form (ascii tables,
xml), then it is easy to continue with statistics with R.  I am not
familiar with statistical functions in perl but I am sure they lay far
behind from those in R.

So, I guess you should use perl at least for the first step, and
depending on the complexity of the ,,more advanced analysis'' either
continue with it or switch to R at the second step.  BTW, R is using
perl heavily for installation and package management.

Perhaps it helps.

Subject: [R] tkclipboard.append(...) and TCL_LIBRARY not set
Message-ID: <F89rRk8J0u70sO3QQXf0001e9ba@hotmail.com>

Dear R-Help,

Searching for a function that will copy the value of an R object to the 
windows clipboard led me to "tkclipboard.append(...)".

Will this function do what I seek? Or if not, does anyone know of such an R 
function?

If tkclipboard.append(...) is what I need, please explain how I can set 
TCL_LIBRARY.  With R 1.6 on W98 I got the following R dialog.  (If it is 
relevant, the DESCRIPTION file does contain a Built line).

Thanking you in advance,

graham lawrence

Subject: [R] some help with this contour plot
Message-ID: <000b01c291fe$dbfb5ec0$0300a8c0@ono>

Hi,

I have imported some netCDF data into R. My data is an array of 4*4*428
(lon,lat, months) dimension.After transforming to a 16*428 matrix dimension
I've performed an svd analysis in order to extract the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues. So

# F is matrix (16,428)

S<-F%*%t(F);

svd.S<-svd(S);

eof1<-svd.S$u[,1];
eof2<-svd.S$u[,2];
eof3<-svd.S$u[,3];

lat range is: 30.5N to 33.5N
lon range is:339.5 to 342.5 degrees east

how do I can plot the eof1 on a contour plot with axis the lat (y-axis) and
lon (x-axis) ranges?

I've made:

x<-(350.5:353.5)
y<-(34.5:37.5)

E1<-array(eof1,c(4,4));
E2<-array(eof2,c(4,4));
E3<-array(eof3,c(4,4));

contour(x,y,E1);
contour(x,y,E2);
contour(x,y,E3);

I get what I think is a nice and right plot, but is this geographically OK?

Thanks in advance

Antonio

This doesn't make sense to me.  An R object is not something the clipboard
can understand.  What exactly do you want to copy to the clipboard? The
contents of a character vector, perhaps?

Hi,

I have data in form: label, x, y. How can I make a scatter plot from the
data, so that the label will be just next to the x, y point?

Hi Zed,

Well, if you want I can host your file, too (thank god the files are really not big so this is no problem). However, I don't know how to 
change the link entries at the jedit community download site.

You wrote some times ago a message to the R mailing list that you intend to improve not only the edit mode file but also to create more 
tools supporting R from within jedit. Have you got any special plans in this direction? Maybe a macro sending the source code 
immediately to R or something like this? (Some people were asking for this via e-mail.) In this case maybe we could cooperate and 
develop something together if you like.

Best regards,

Tobias.

Sorry for the delay (I was working abroad).

Yes. It is a bug, and the last argument to .C("pred_garch",...) should be
as.integer(FALSE). I saw that Kurt already corrected it and putted the new
version on CRAN. Hopefully this should be ok now.

Thanks and best

Potentially, you could sink() to a text connection and then
tkclipboard.append(paste(lines,collapse="\n")). However, I bet noone
actually tried this, and I'm unsure whether it works on Windows or
perhaps might be an X11-only feature.

plot(x,y)
text(x,y,labels)

should give you an idea.  Note that you need to adjust x-values
(and/or y-values) for text(), othervise the points and text overlap.

Perhaps it helps

Do not want to argue with prof. Ripley, but I have just got my
hand on a copy of MASS (and it is really great book, thanks!),
and there I read on page 34: ``The filename clipboard may be used
on Windows to refer to the Windows clipboard for input or output
(but the file length is limited to 32Kb).''

So it was possible to do something like it even on the late
Windows 3.*. Why it shouldn't be possible now (or was the feature
in S-PLUS such disaster?).

Just curious,

	Matej

D. Morisette has also reported some 'weird' coverages, which do not
follow the standards. Perhaps you have  one of them. Please, take a look
at http://pages.infinit.net/danmo/e00/docs/v7_bin_cover.html

Anyway, if you want to send me your data, I'll be pleased to test them
myself. This may help.

I'm new to R and looking for a way to use a variable to reference to an

I'm plotting several graphs on top of each other and want to do this by 
a for loop. The field I want to graph have names like a1,a2,a3, ...
I can't figure out how to get this working:

It should look like this:
lines(spectral$Wavelength,paste("spectral$a",j,sep=""),col=j)

but the "paste()" does not seem to work in this context.

Any help?

Kind regards,

Kris

Hi All,

Yesterday I sent a message about the html Search Engine not working
properly.  I repeat that message below.  I received some suggestions that
I should have Java running.  I take that to mean that I have "enabled"
Java in the preferences list inside Mozilla.  Yes, it's "running", or so
it appears.  I also opened (not from within R) the html help files using
Internet Explorer 5.2 (Mac OS X) and experienced the same problem with the
search engine html page in R not working, and, yes, Java is indicated as
enabled.  So, initial evidence seems to indicate that the solution is not
so simple as to have Java running.  Still, I am not so savvy about these
things that the solution could not be this simple.  So, other suggestions
are appreciated.  Thanks!

jarrett

PS  In my previous message I (actually mozilla -version) indicated
that I was running mozilla 5.0.  Apparently this is a futuristic version
and I may be running something like mozilla 1.0.  Suffice it to say, there
seems to be some conflicting information on reporting the version number
of mozilla.  Anyway, I don't think this is relevant in this case.

It works.  One day we will have "clipboard" connections on Windows (at
least).

Subject: [R] Plotting all lines of a data frame
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211221744230.2682-100000@pcatd37.cern.ch>

Hello,

	I'm trying to use R to plot a series of events (contained in a
data.frame) into a single plot. In this case, the data columns represent 
known time marks. I would like to visually see the timing between those 
marks, for all events at once. What would be the fastest way to make that?

	My data.frame is like this
     event.1 event.2 event.3 ... event.N
1      0       52     87           563   # <<<- first event
2      12      63     99           570   # <<<- second event
...
50     301    350     387          799   # <<<- fiftieth event

	It is relatively easy to make it with plot() and then lines(), but
that would have to use a for() loop, what compromises the speed in which I
can have the results. I still have files with 5,000, sometimes 50,000
events...

	Regards, Andre.

Hello All,

I read in the archives that someone managed to compile R but that there were
problems with the fp performance, specifically the handling of NaNs. Could
someone please explain the problem to me and how to test whether it is
occurring.

I have just compiled R for the Zaurus 5500, and want to see whether it works
or requires tweaking.

Hi,

I'm new to R and looking for a way to use a variable to reference to an 
object.

I'm plotting several graphs on top of each other and want to do this by 
a for loop. The field I want to graph have names like a1,a2,a3, ...
I can't figure out how to get this working:

It should look like this:
lines(spectral$Wavelength,paste("spectral$a",j,sep=""),col=j)

but the "paste()" does not seem to work in this context.

Any help?

Kind regards,

Kris

1. I suggest to generate a list "a", which can be indexed with a[[j]],
so you don't need any sophisticated mechanism to reference to your
objects.

2. Answer of your question: Use get().

Dear Listers -

R1.61 on NT

We are trying to fit a polynomial usning nlme so that in ax^2+bx+c, c is 
fixed and a and b are random.

The data are
Frames = speed of flight (20-50)
Manlength = tail length (-20,0)
ID = individual (14 of them)

each individual has experienced each of 6 tail lengths in the range above 
and we are interested in the shape of the relationship between speed and 
manipulation.

using the following approach based on the Venables and Ripley (3rd ed) 
examples with the Sitka data set

nlme(Frames~a*Manlength^2+b*Manlength+c,
+ fixed=list(c~1),random=a+b~1|ID,
+ start=list(fixed=c(0.3,6,50)))

Error in nlme.formula(Frames ~ a * Manlength^2 + b * Manlength + c, fixed = 
list(c ~  :
         starting values for the fixed component are not the correct length

-realizing that something is wrong with how we have framed the start 
values... can anyone advise?

cheers

I'm not going to dig through all my emails just now, but AFAIR,
something wrong turned up with simple stuff like

x <- NA
is.na(x)
x+1
2*x

or similar stuff with x <- 0/0.

There was just an exchange on this earlier this week under Linux (RH
8.0).  

My experience is that both Java AND JavaScript need to be enabled in
Mozilla for the search to function properly.  Be sure that JavaScript
for Navigator is also enabled in your browser. This is enabled under:

Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Scripts & Plugins

In addition, Professor Ripley indicated that in his experience there
appear to be Mozilla version specific issues with the search feature
functioning properly. That post is at
http://www.r-project.org/nocvs/mail/r-help/2002/9492.html.  Presuming
that the underlying Java runtime versions remain the same, this might
be suggestive of version specific Java/JavaScript bug issues in
Mozilla.

I would verify which version of Mozilla you are running and if need
be, upgrade.

Hope this helps provide some direction.

I think I've posted this before, but the H-L test has disadvantages: low power, sensitive to arbitrary choices of intervals, other issues related to testing the model on the training data.  The Hosmer-Le Cessie test is a one d.f. omnibus test of lack of fit for a binary logistic model that will generally have more power than H-L, and it does not require one to construct intervals of predicted probabilities.  The new test is done by the residuals.lrm function in the Design library (http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/Design.html).  Like all omnibus tests, it will have low power against directed alternatives (e.g., nonlinearity, nonadditivity).

You must have got an obselete edition, then!  (It's not in the current
edition.)  It talks about data files, not S-PLUS objects in the third
edition.

Because we are talking about the difference between objects and data
files.  I think Graham meant the result of printing the object, not the
object itself.

One day it will be possible to use "clipboard" on R for Windows too, but
the amount of programming needed looked non-trivial to Guido and I when we
looked at it.

No, it wouldn't.  That gives you the name of the variable, not the
variable.

Probably the simplest solution is either
   lines(spectral$Wavelength, spectral[[paste("a",j,sep="")]],col=j)
but there's also
   lines(spectral$Wavelength,get(paste("spectral$a",j,sep="")),col=j)
and various others

You can use the function 'lines' within apply() --- as well as other
functions.

Anyway, I don't believe the speed of the for() loop will be the major
problem - what about visualizing 50000 * #time.marks at once in one
plot? Do you think the plot will be very informative?

First the good news - you don't need to use nlme to fit a polynomial
model.  A polynomial is linear in the coefficients so you can use lme,
which is much easier than nlme.

lme(Frames ~ Manlength + I(Manlength^2), random = Manlength)

The problem with your usage of nlme is that you gave 3 values for the
starting estimates of the fixed-effects parameters and there is only
one parameter for fixed-effects the way you wrote it.  You should have
used "fixed=list(a+b+c ~ 1)" (or, equivalently, "fixed=a+b+c~1") but
you really don't want to use nlme for a linear model.

I'm trying to write the code for performing nonlinear three-stage least

Frank,
You are quite right of course, the line:

rounded.fu <-ceiling(fuperiod)

does the trick.

As to why, this is what the J Bone Jnt Surg expect, although I agree  
that there is a loss of precision.

Any way thank you again.

Oops - I got that wrong.  The random argument should be

Subject: [R] simple test on slope of lm()
Message-ID: <3DDE9CDB.B27B77CB@univ-brest.fr>

Hello

I want to compare the slope (let's say 'b') of a linear model obtained 
with lm() to a theoretical value (let's say 'th').

To do so, I think I should compute a 't value' using 
something like :

(b - 'th')/standard.deviation(b)

and then look at the p-value of this computed t.

I don't understand how to do this in a simple way, just using lm() 
outputs for example. 

I'm sorry of such a naive/newbie question, and thank you so much for 
taking time to answer.

Message-ID: <874ra9dzgt.fsf@lumen.indyrad.iupui.edu>

I have some data frames that contain logical values.  When I
write the frame to a file with write.table(df, filename,
row.names=F, sep=','), I end up with the logicals looking like
either ...,FALSE,... or ..., TRUE,... .  That space in front of
the TRUE is causing me problems when I read the frame again with
df <- read.table(filename,header=T,sep=',').  

Reading the data leaves me with this:

> df$valid
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[13]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

[19] "FALSE" " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE"
[28] " TRUE" " TRUE" " TRUE"

Can anyone suggest a way to read this column so that I can use it
as a logical without having to first do something like

df$valid <- as.logical(sub(' ','',as.character(df$valid)))

I have further experimented with the pipe() issue and found a workaround:

It prepends two lines to the output of the pipe() instruction, but
otherwise seems to work.

Subject: [R] read.table, write.table, logicals and spaces?
In-Reply-To: <874ra9dzgt.fsf@lumen.indyrad.iupui.edu>
Message-ID: <001e01c29299$6deb8b80$7341a8c0@alpha.wehi.edu.au>

A solution to your problem is to specify the argument colClasses:

df <- read.table(filename,header=T,sep=',', colClasses=colClasses)

where colClasses is a vector of character strings specifying the data
type of each column. For example:

data <- runif(30)
df <- data.frame(data=data, valid=(data > 0.5))
write.table(df, "tmp.dat", row.names=FALSE, sep=",")
df2 <- read.table("tmp.dat", header=TRUE, colClasses=c("double",
"logical"), sep=",")
print(as.logical(df2$valid)) 
#  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
TRUE
# [13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
TRUE
# [25]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

If you do not know the data type of a column in advance you can specify
it as NA (note not "NA"), e.g. colClasses=c(NA, "logical"). Specifying
the colClasses argument will also make read.table much faster. 

What is happening is that write.table() is first converting your data
frame to a matrix using as.matrix(). Try as.matrix(df) and there you see
why you get " TRUE" and not "TRUE". This is what is written to file.
When read.table() then reads the file it will not read it as a logical,
but as a factor variable, e.g.

> df2 <- read.table("tmp.dat", header=TRUE, colClasses=c("double", NA),
sep=",")
> df2$valid
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
TRUE
[13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
TRUE
[25]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
Levels:  TRUE FALSE

> df2 <- read.table("tmp.dat", header=TRUE, colClasses=c("double",
"logical"), sep=",")
> df2$valid
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
TRUE
[13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
TRUE
[25]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

Note the last line "Levels:  TRUE FALSE" in the first case.

Subject: [R] Possible solution for Mozilla/help.start() search problems
Message-ID: <3DDF39CE.9020300@MedAnalytics.com>

I thought that I would post a follow up given the several posts on this
same subject in the past week. All R comments pertain to 1.6.1.

Earlier in the week using a development build of Mozilla under RH 8.0, I
was able to get the help.start() based search engine to work with both
Java and JavaScript enabled. This was using what I believed to be the
V1.2b branch of Mozilla, in which both Xft anti-aliasing font support
and Gtk2 support for RH 8.0 was included. There are RH 8.0 specific RPMS
located at:

http://komodo.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/experimental/gtk2/

Upon verifying the version number however, this branch turns out to be
V1.3a of Mozilla, not 1.2b. At least this is what it is identifying 
itself as. The build that worked was dated 2002-11-18.
I post this for the sake of clarification.

Late tonight, I updated my Mozilla installation with the latest build
from the same branch, which is dated 2002-11-22.  Sure enough, the
help.start() search engine is non-functional with this build.

I spent some time tonight going back through and installing the several
builds from this past week and the build dated 2002-11-20 does not work
either.  Going back to the build from 2002-11-18 the search engine does 
work.

The only common observation that I had made is that in the versions
where the engine does not work, the browser status line message 
indicating that the Java applet has started, does not appear.  It does 
appear in the version from 2002-11-18, where the engine functions as 
expected. Thus it would seem that there is something intrinsic in the 
differing Mozilla versions that is inhibiting the R Java applet from 
properly loading and starting.

I spent some time tonight on both the Sun and Mozilla sites reviewing
FAQ's and Bugzilla and noted a variety of open Java related issues.

However, I did find one clue in the Mozilla 1.2b Release Notes that 
seems to have worked and I now have the help.start() search engine 
working in the 2002-11-22 Mozilla 1.3a build. The note would suggest 
that the browser may have problems locating the required Java modules to 
load and start the applet.

The fix seems to be to create (as root) a symlink to the file:

/usr/java/JAVA_VERSION/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji.so

in your active Mozilla plugins directory.

In the process of doing this, I noted that there were multiple Moz* 
directories in /usr/lib, given the updating that I have done since 
installing RH 8.0. There was no symlink in usr/lib/Mozilla-1.3a/plugins.

Upon adding the symlink, lo and behold the help.start() search engine 
worked. If I remove the symlink, it fails.

Thus it is possible that as folks update Mozilla and Java installations 
and the respective directory structures change from version to version, 
this may cause a problem for Mozilla in properly locating the Java 
modules required to run the R search engine.

The pertinent release notes for Mozilla 1.2b are located at:

http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.2b/#java

There are also comments there for Windows and similar comments are 
present in the release notes for earlier versions as well.

I though I would pass this on as a possible solution given the problems 
noted here of late.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Marc,

I think that is the clue.  I copied the Netscape installation of the Java
plugins into my Moz 1.2b installation.  For 1.1 I let Mozilla download
Java support.  The first works with R, the second did not.

Looks like _adding_ Java support to Mozilla is not setup correctly.
Thanks for your patience in looking into this.

The "get" function is the usual answer to this sort of question, but is 
not right
for this particular case.  Actually, a simpler answer works.

lines(spectral$Wavelength, spectral[[ paste("a", j, sep="") ]], col=j)

Using "get" would want to get objects with names like "spectral$a1"
rather than the "a1" component of "spectral".

Subject: [R] Understanding function residuals()
Message-ID: <005501c2934e$db267ce0$c5d994cb@andrewvhowclyz>

Hello:

I am trying to understand why glm() does not replicate the results in
Dobson, "Introduction to Generalized Linear Models," pp. 17-20.

I set up the following model. The variable CONDT is assumed as Poisson and
the objective is to estimate the expected value.

The data (chronic medical conditions among women in Australia) is as
follows:

    CONDT <- c(0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1,
                          2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1,
                          1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2)

The Poisson model estimating the mean:

    summary(fm1 <- glm(CONDT ~ 1, family = poisson(link = 'identity')))

The estimated coefficient obtained matches the results in Dobson exactly.
But I am unable to replicate the value for the log-likelihood using the
results on deviance or null deviance (the same here) from R. If you plug
into the log-likelihood function the coefficient value and the values for
CONDT, you get log(L) = - 68.3868  This is what is reported in Dobson. That
number I cannot seem to gleam from R.

Another question:  For a Poisson model like this, what is the difference
between the fm1$residuals and residuals(fm1)?  I expected, when taking the
ratio of one to the other, to get a vector of constants. Not so.  The values
for fm1$residuals are the difference between the actual and fitted values,
but what about residuals(fm1)?  They are not standardized residuals for a
Poisson model such as this.

Thanks for your help,
ANDREW

Subject: [R] princomp question
Message-ID: <3DDFA9C0.3030600@ti.com>

Hello.

I know that I'm not welcome on that list but maybe someone will
still shed some light on a question I'm trying to solve through all
weekend.

I use princomp() to get a PCA components and then use these components
to build a classification model.

When I use new data with that model (data which I did not have when
I did the original PCA), I have to aplly a PCA first and then use PCA
components with my model.

The problem is - I would like (actually, I think I have) to use an 
eigenbasis
from the first PCA when I do a PCA on a new data.

So the question is - how can I use the eigenbasis (loadings ??) from 
princomp()
output as an argument to another princomp() when processig a new data.

Thanks in advance.

P.S. I know I managed to annoy quite a few people here - well, these 
people - plz.
ignore my posting.

If you want loglikelihoods you use the logLik() function.

`log Lik.' -68.38682 (df=1)

You shouldn't use fm1$residuals --- the S language doesn't prevent you
from accessing internal fields of objects directly, but it's still a bad
idea, especially if you don't know what they mean.

The residuals() function for a glm provides five different sorts of
residuals according to the "type" argument (as described in
help(residuals.glm)).  The values for fm1$residuals are in fact *not* the
difference between the actual and fitted data (in this model they are
equal purely by coincidence).

Hi,

I understand that I can find t-test for the significance of the
correlation coefficient on sample to population, but is there way
how to make this test for more than one pair of variables
together as easily as I can make a correlation matrix for more
variables with cor(cbind(A,B,C,D))?

Thanks,

Thanks especially to Thomas and Renaud for your help.

I have now come to learn about the function logLik().  The "type" for
residuals() I was looking for turns out to be residuals(fm1, type =
'pearson').  That, for a Poisson, is a standardized residual.

That was exactly what I was looking for.

Professor Ripley,

Glad to be of help and thank you for your kind comments.

In my review of the Sun and Mozilla sites, there appear to be common 
installation/update design issues that impact the proper functioning of 
the Java plugins and therefore the applets. There are many posts in 
Bugzilla, which lead me to think that a resolution to this may require a 
level of standardization and cooperation between the involved parties. 
There is a definite "chicken and egg" disposition that comes through in 
some of the posts.

One can reasonably argue however, that the burden would be on the 
browser folks, since Java is meant to be platform/application 
independent. If a browser module/plugin is required for a particular 
page, the browser should search for it and if not installed, request 
that it be installed and update it's links accordingly for subsequent 
use. It is this process that seems to escape Mozilla at present.

Of course, having the Java plugins themselves in a standardized (ie. 
non-version specific) location would be of immense help as well and save 
search time.

Near term, it may be appropriate to consider adding a note in 
?help.start, the R FAQ and/or perhaps on 
.../doc/html/search/SearchEngine.html to refer folks to the release 
notes/FAQ for their platform/browser combination as to any issues 
relevant to the proper functioning of the Java plugins and therefore the 
R search applet.

Given the plethora of combinations of OSs and browsers, it may be 
problematic to provide specific instructions that would be relevant to 
any particular R user. Though, it may be reasonable that Mozilla and its 
Gecko based derivatives are sufficiently prevalent within the R 
Community that providing detailed instructions in that case would be 
appropriate. I would defer to others on that.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

Hello,

I would like to set up some automatic reporting using R. For this purpose, I 
need to include the output of "print" commands into the graphics produced by 
some "plot" commands.

1. Is there an easy way to do this?

2. Is it possible to redirect "print" into a string? 
    (except redirecting into a file and than scanning back?)

3. What is the best way to get a multi-line string printed into a plot window?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Try this:

tc <- textConnection("txt",open="w")
sink(tc)
matrix(1:9,3)
sink()
close(tc)
plot(0,0)
text(-.5,.5,paste(txt,collapse="\n"))

Hmm,... It seems that we really could use a monospaced graphics font!

Klaus - this was an active discussion on r-help just a few days ago.  Please check the e-mail archives available through www.r-project.org.  You can start with text(x,y,'First Line\nSecond Line') but there are more general approaches for writing blocks of text onto graphics.  The most beautiful outcome in my opinion is obtained using LaTeX, so I strongly encourage you to look at Sweave in the tools package, or to construct a customized interface between R and LaTeX as I am working on for clinical trial reports.  Slides for my recent talk on this may be obtained at
http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/presentations/feh/clinreport/dmcreport.pdf

With LaTeX the text, tables, and graphics are intermixed in a professional way.  I am finding good success in using R and high-level graphics and LaTeX interface functions in the Hmisc library for pharmaceutical research statistical reports.  Having R generate all tables, graphics, LaTeX graphics inclusion macro calls, and figure captions, and using pdflatex with hyperref to automatically hyperlink everything has many advantages.  For reports that are not run repeatedly over time (so that it is not worth the time of special customizations), Sweave is a wonderful tool and LaTeX is one of the best productivity tools ever invented (and it is free too).

You're not doing anything wrong, but the old code was. The basic issue
was that if you built an old package after a newer one was issued, and
then tried to upgrade, then the old object files were newer than the
new source files, and hence weren't updated. Someone got bitten by
this during the 1.6.1 burn-in so we changed it to rebuild
unconditionally. If you have a better scheme for avoiding that effect,
please tell...

Read the top few lines of MkRules!

You have edited in an editor which damaged it, most likely.

We have seen this question several times during the last weeks. Most
likely you edited MkRules in a way that did not preserve the tabs (e.g.
WinEdt's default behaviour is replacing tabs by 4 blanks).
And tabs are syntactically neccessary!

In a nearly arbitrary folder, but *not* into this one, please. The
binaries will be installed into that folder automatically ...

Should work, if your R is running and configured appropriately (at least
when compiling the whole R works).

Subject: [R] illustration  of graphics terms in R?
Message-ID: <JFEDJKCABKCOMJDIIFPJIEGHCGAA.tarnold@smpllc.com>

Hello,
I'm using R to do survey analysis and plotting. I've gotten good help on this
list to sort out specific plotting issues, but I think I could do a lot more
on my own if I could find a good reference that explained some of the graphics
terms and concepts used by R. I haven't found a general discussion of the
graphics environment, with illustrations. Part of my problem is that the help
text is all text. There are no figures to illustrate the terms used.  For
example, I would like to be able to *see* the relationship of these concepts
illustrated:

figure region
device region
plot region
user coordinates
normalized device coordinates
margin
outer margin

Also, there are a number of par settings that apparently work on the same
underlying data but using different units. For example, oma, omi, omd; mai and
mar. The documentation for "mar" says: "A numerical vector of the form
'c(bottom, left, top, right)' which gives the lines of margin to be specified
on the four sides of the plot..." After some experimentation I found that csi
* mar = mai, so I guess mar is "lines of text" of size "csi". But all this
could be much better illustrated if it were... illustrated.

If there is no such introduction with diagrams to show the relation of the
different par values, I suppose I could start to create one, but could
certainly use help, if only in editing, from someone who actually *knows* how
this stuff works.

Thanks for whatever guidance you may be able to offer.
-Tom

Well, you might look at the pages around p.75 in "An introduction to
R" which ships with the sources (builds as R-intro.pdf).

There are figures in the PDF/DVI versions of `An Introduction to R' and in
Venables & Ripley (any edition of MASS).

If you missed `An Introduction to R' you really should look at it.

I don't think end users even need to know about `normalized device
coordinates'.

I am not entirely sure why the HTML version of `An Introduction to R'
lacks the figures: probably limitations of makeinfo.

Subject: [R] unif_rand() and exp_rand()
Message-ID: <3DE141F0.600230E4@math.mun.ca>

Dear R-users:

Recently I found my simulation run into an apparently infinite loop.
After a few days of tracing and chasing, I believe it is caused by
the built-in unif_rand() and exp_rand() functions: unif_rand() can
produce a value of 0 which causes the following part of exp_rand()
running into an infinity loop

    u = unif_rand();
    for (;;) {
    u += u;
    if (u > 1.0)
        break;
    a += q[0];
    }

The way I use R is slightly non-standard: I run the program in
R 1.3.1 for Linux, and my program contains the C code of
exp_rand() I grabbed from R 1.5.1 source. I am not sure whether
the problem is caused by the mixed versions of unif_rand() and
exp_rand(). If they are all the same in the two versions, then
exp_rand() always has potential to run into an infinite loop if
unif_rand() is allowed to have zero values. Does anybody
encounter similar problem?

Paul.

I am attempting to install the netCDF module into R on a computer
running solaris 5.8 but it keeps saying it can not find the required
netCDF libraries & header files, error below. I have run configure, as

./configure --with-netCDF=/usr/local/netcdf-3.5.0

To configure the path, but keep getting the following error.

checking for ncopen in -lnetcdf... no

I know it is a path problem but can not find the file to modify to
get the correct path. Know doubt this happened before but could 
somebody tell me what to modify to correct this problems.

Dear List

Sorry if this is trivial, but I can't find it in the manual, FAQ or mail
list (2002).

I just installed R 1.6.0 (2002-10-01) on Linux R.H. 7.2 (2.4.9-32.5) on an
DIGITAL AlphaServer 800 5/500

The program starts up nicely but exits immediately with a "Segmentation
fault" at the first command. It seems that it doesn't matter what command, I
tried q(), help(), version, licence(), x<-1, etc. 

All comments are welcomed.

Subject: [R] Logistic Regression on a Windows Machine
Message-ID: <F71IfpT8vWyu9kstC7t000050e1@hotmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I am hoping you can help me.  I just downloaded and installed the 
"precompiled binary distribution" of R to my Windows machine (running 
Windows Millennium).  (I did not download or install anything else - no 
packages).

I need to run a logistic regression and understand the function I need is 
polr() or maybe SSlogis().

However, when I try to invoke either function, I get
    Error: couldn't find function "polr"
    Error: couldn't find function "SSlogis"

I have done some snooping on the website and think I may need the MASS 
package for polr() and the NLS package for SSlogis().

My questions:
1.  Are these indeed the functions I need to run a logistic regression?
2.  If so, are the packages with them available for a Windows machine?

Thanks a million in advance -- you all are the greatest
-- Carrie

I've not met this, but it is in principle possible for some of the
random-number generators (including user-supplied, of course).  It may
also depend on the arithmetic on the platform used, which may depend on
the compiler used.  So usages of unif_rand should be able to handle 0 or
1. I will alter exp_rand to do so.

Hi Fred,

Maybe this helps

	My.lm<-summary(lm(y~x))
	My.lm$coefficients

It gives you the parameters estimates with t and p-values. Have a look
at 
	names(my.lmmodel) and 
	names(summary(my.lmmodel)

If you only need to calculate the p-value having t then

	 p <- 2*(1-pt(abs(t),df=your.df)))

Subject: [R] simple test on slope of lm()


Hello

I want to compare the slope (let's say 'b') of a linear model obtained 
with lm() to a theoretical value (let's say 'th').

To do so, I think I should compute a 't value' using 
something like :

(b - 'th')/standard.deviation(b)

and then look at the p-value of this computed t.

I don't understand how to do this in a simple way, just using lm() 
outputs for example. 

I'm sorry of such a naive/newbie question, and thank you so much for 
taking time to answer.

What compiler?

RedHat's used of `gcc 2.96' is notorious around here.  Could you try
building under an actual released version of gcc if you used `2.96'?

BTW, R 1.6.1 is the current version, so why not use it?

Not sure about your first question, depends on what you want to do (standard 
logistic regression can be done with the glm function, while polr does 
proportional odds logistic regression).

As for R packages (more commonly referred to as libraries), many of them come 
with the default R installation, but you have to load them before you can use 
them. MASS and nls are among them. You should see a full list using

library()

For more information, try

?glm
library(MASS)
?polr

etc.

Hello,

To test the slope of your linear model against an arbitrary value, you can 
use lm() directly with a little trick. Let b1 be the value of the slope you 
want to test your model against, then use lm(y-b1*x~x). The significance 
test of the slope for this lm model gives the answer you need.

 > x <- rnorm(10)
 > y <- 2*x + rnorm(10)
 > lm(y~x)
 > lm(y-2*x~x)

Hope this helped,

Yves Brostaux.

Probably not.  See ?glm if you mean a binomial logistic regression.
nls/SSlogis will give you a least-squares logistic fit.

Yes, just look at the results of library().

Objet : Using XEmacs and ESS with R for MS/Windows



I've been working on a document describing the use of XEmacs and ESS with R 
for Windows users, along with configuration files that are meant to make 
things simple for Windows users. This was initially intended for my 
students, but with recent discussions of Windows (and other) editors on the 
the R-help list, I thought that I'd make the material more widely available.

The document describes how to install, configure, and use XEmacs and ESS 
with R under Windows. The configuration files divide the XEmacs windows 
into two sub-windows, one for R source files (with tabs when multiple files 
are open), the other with the R process. A customized toolbar is provided 
with buttons to send individual lines, "paragraphs," marked regions of 
text, and functions from the source window to the R process; there are 
other buttons to source the whole file silently, and to interrupt the R 
process. Menus are provided to perform operations similar to those in the 
standard Windows R GUI -- for example, to install, load, and update 
packages. In general, I've tried to provide features available in the R GUI 
and in Uwe Ligges's R plug-in for the shareware editor WinEdt. As well, 
I've attempted to make XEmacs appear more Windows-like in its behaviour, 
for example by defining standard Windows editing keys.

More information is available at 
<http://www.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/ESS/>.

Comments and suggestions would be appreciated.

I believe we fixed a bug with the readline stack for 1.6.1, which
only affected 64-bit systems. That could be the one sticking its head
up here.

(Well, only and only --- we found that fixing that bug uncovered
another one on all systems where the stack isn't dropped on Ctrl-C.)

I run R on two different 64-bit systems (using readline), and that bug did
not occur at startup on those.  Starting R with --no-readline would
check if that is the cause.

R is regularly built and tested on several 64-bit systems, which is why I
suspected the compiler no being 64-bit.

It was PR#2165 I was thinking of. That was on Tru64, but isn't that the
same Alpha hardware? Symptoms are certainly similar.

Just for Curiosity:
R-1.3.0 up to R-1.5.1 compiled well on both Tru64 OSF4.x and OSF5.1 with
the respective CC/CXX/FXX and Compaq's libs.

Starting with R-1.6.0, OSF4.x has troubles compiling/linking R with
Compaq's compilers/libs (and readline). On OSF5.x R compiles still fine
out of the box. 

Since most of our boxes are now (far too late) on OSF5.x, I did not find
it worth anything to go into details and search for incompabilities.

I have no idea on which Tru64 OSF  version the mentioned AlphaServer is
running but perhaps this workaround might be worth a shot.

Cheers

Michael

P.S.: My gut feeling is that this is merely an incompability with
Compaq/HP's libs (which aren't best conforming standards).

Dear Pro. Ripley, Mr. Dalsgaard and list

1) Downloaded source for ver 1.6.1 and recompiled.
2) Tried to use ccc in stead of gcc, though not sure that worked 100%

Now it seems to work okay - waiting for other users to verify that...

Thanks

Compiling on Windows for Windows has nothing to do with cross-compiling

Read again: INSTALL says:

Check your path
---------------

You need the following in your path:
.
our toolset
mingw\bin
Perl\bin
the latex bin directory
zip.exe, unzip.exe, hhc.exe

Do not use spaces nor unnecessary quotes in your PATH variable.


so I think you failed to follow one whole chunk of the instructions!

Surely you are not cross-compiling!  If you were, Rcmd would not work.

Uwe Ligges already told you *not* to unpack in ...\rw1061\library, but
that seems to be exactly what you have done, hence the problem.

Hi,

I would like to announce the first version of GraspeR. It is a port of GRASP (Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Predictions) written for S-Plus, to R. It serves as an "automated" method for doing spatial predictions. You can find the first testing version at http://www.fivaz.ch/grasper/index.html. For now, I provide a dump file you can read with source(). A UNIX package is also available but do not try it, it's an outdated version. I will upload soon the up-to-date version for UNIX. A few
screenshots are available at http://www.fivaz.ch/grasper/scrshots.html. Feel free to try it. It has been released under the gpl license. So feel also free to comment and send bug reports to me.

Best wishes

Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C202F2C2F0@groexmb02.pfizer.com>


The gregmisc library contains a function 'glh.test' for testing general
linear hypotheses which can be used to perform this test:

> x <- rnorm(100)
> y <- x + rnorm(100)
> model <- lm(y ~ x)
> model

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)            x  
    -0.1031       1.0172  

> library(gregmisc)
Loading required package: MASS 

Attaching package `gregmisc':


        The following object(s) are masked from package:base :

         lowess 

> # test:  0*b0 + 1*b1 = 1 
> glh.test( model, cm=c(0,1), d=1)

         Test of General Linear Hypothesis      
Call:
glh.test(reg = model, cm = c(0, 1), d = 1)
F = 0.0285, df1 =  1, df2 = 98, p-value = 0.8663

Thanks for your time and effort on this Marc.  Unfortunately, Apple has
"integrated" Java into Mac OS X (Darwin) and, according to a tech at
Apple, I cannot simply get a new Java plug-in.  I must wait for an update
of OS X.  So much for Java being platform independent.  BTW, I've tried
Netscape 7, IE 5.2 (both OS X) and Mozilla 1.0 and Opera (version?) (both
Darwin), all with the same problem.  In the meantime, I'm using the
help.search() and help() combo.  However, I seem to recall reading some
place that an earlier version of Netscape (4.x?) has its own Java
component and, presumably, would not depend on an external plug-in.
If/when I decide to investigate this, I'll report accordingly.  Thanks
again!

Subject: [R] scale for the y-axis
Message-ID: <EDEPKIBGJMPNCCMEDIOLAELPCGAA.simonl@comp.leeds.ac.uk>

hi there
I hope you can help me
I'm doing a boxplot and I'm trying to change the y-axis from seconds to
minutes
I do this:
boxplot ( time~movement*scene, ylab = "Time (seconds)", xlab = "Condition")

but seconds goes from 0 to 900 and I'm looking to change it into minutes

I've been though the manuals but I don't know what you call this function so
its hard to look it up
I've looked up scale y-axis division etc, but can't find anything

can you help?

Hi Josmar,

Look at:

Subject: [R] library help files
Message-ID: <OF98EB5777.43432E2C-ON80256C7C.005CE44F@bnpparibas.com>


Dear all,

I am writing my small working library. I have done most of the work and it
seems working well in R. The library name appears in the package list when
I type help.start().

Now my problem is about the help files. I have done help file in Rd format
and translated it to HTML format (I have a subdirectory (named html) with
html file in it and a subdirectory (named help) with .Rd files in it) .
What I want are:

1. I can use those help files when i open the help windows with help.start
();;
2. When I type help(function name) in R command window, the help file will
jump out on the screen.

I think there must be some introduction somewhere. I couldn't find it in
'Writing R Extension'. Could anybody point out somewhere or some wayI can
implement the above two things?

Thanks a lot!

Huan

Mine is installed in /usr/lib. I don't remember which of the Mandrake 9.0 disks
it is on, but I'm pretty sure it is on one of them.

In-Reply-To: <5.1.0.14.2.20021124091444.01dc6318@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca> from "John Fox" at Nov 24, 2002 09:18:55 AM
Message-ID: <200211251717.BAA23206@ibm.stat.ncku.edu.tw>

Dear Prof. Fox,

Thanks very much for providing such a great setup for Windows users
to use ESS + XEmacs!
This shall not only speed up the productivity of programming and
using R, but also extremely attractive to potential users,
particularly to students in my 'statistical methods',
'reliability analysis', and 'programming design' classes.

Frankly, I have used your setup, found in R-mailing-list mentioned
by someone's post of question, for about a month.
I am very pleased to find that you add an R submenu to the ESS menu,
along with an Exit R/XEmacs submenu to the File menu, and available
of key-combinations for cut, copy and paste.

However, I got the following problem and wandered about two things
of installing XEmacs in Section 3 of your document.

1) After installing new version of fox-ESS-config.zip,
   there is no action when <Enter> pressed in the lower window.
   (return to confirm) is message appeared in the Minibuffer
   when I choose Send command from iESS menu.

   This did not happened to the previous version.

   I noticed the mode line of the lower window shows
   (iESS PenDel Font [R]: run)
   rather than
   (iESS Font [R]: run) as in your document.

   This extra 'PenDel' also appears in the mode line of the upper window.

   And those paste line, function, ..., all won't actually execute
   whatever in the upper window.

   This affects is I have to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to kill 'Rterm' then
   to close XEmacs under my Win98.

2) Later I found that after kill 'Rterm' with Ctrl+Alt+Del, do
   M-x R in the minibuffer to invoke R, then everything works.

3) XEmacs package xemacs-i586-pc-win32 is required to download,
   but not mentioned in page 10 of your document.

4) Your configuration seems required XEmacs at least 21.4.9 version,
   however this seems not mentioned in the document.

5) I found the init.el file in fox.ess.config.exe and fox.ess.config.zip
   having different date, one is 11/23 and another is 11/24.
   Any difference?

Again, thanks very much for making ESS + XEmacs so convenient and 
powerful to use!

BTW, your book "An R and S-Plus Companion to Applied Regression" is
also great.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10211250859490.9969-100000@ofis450a.akctr.noaa.gov>

This simple function was written to superimpose error bars on a scatter
plot but can be also used with simple barplots. See second example.

"superpose.eb" <- function (x, y, ebl, ebu = ebl, lh = 0.01,   ...) 
{
#function to add error bars to an existing scatterplot
#written by Anne York, May 2002
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#ebu is the length of the upper error bar; assumed to be a vector with same
#                                          length of x and y
#ebl is the length of the lower error bar; assumed to be a vector with same
#                                          length of x and y
#2*lh is a the length of the tick at the end of the error bar
#it is assumed that the limits of the axes on the existing plot are 
#sufficiently large to accomodate the error bars.

    segments(x, y + ebu, x, y - ebl, ...)
    segments(x - lh , y + ebu, x + lh , y + ebu, 
        ...)
    segments(x - lh, y - ebl, x + lh , y - ebl,  ...)
}



#Examples:
my.ebl <- 2*abs(rnorm(10))
plot(1:10,1:10,ylim = c((0-max(ebl)),10+max(ebl)))
superpose.eb(1:10,1:10,ebl=my.ebl, lh = 0.05)


#Also works with a simple barplot:
dum <- barplot(1:10,ylim=c(0,12))
my.ebu <- abs(rnorm(10))
superpose.eb(dum[,1],1:10,ebl = 0, ebu=my.ebu, lh = 0.1, lwd = 3, col
="red")
points(dum[,1],1:10,pch=16, col = "red") # covers up the lower tick mark

Subject: [R] adding SE to bar plots

Hello.  I know that one can add standard errors to a bar plot by repeated 
use of the lines() function, but this can be long when there are many 
bars.  I wonder if there is not already some other function that does this 
automatically?

I think Josmar would be grateful to know the output of 

  rpm -qf /usr/lib/libg2c.so

You need package libf2c0-3.2-1mdk, PLEASE DON'T look for it on rpmfind.
All you need to do is, as root, write:

urpmi libf2c0

and the system  will ask for the relevant installation CD.

Subject: [R] Full enumeration, how can this be vectorized
Message-ID: <000201c294ae$66e79ab0$0200a8c0@chiloe>

Hi all,

I am currently using the code snippet below to minimize a function which I
wasn't able to minimize properly with optim (cliffy surface, constraints,
poles). Obviously this iteration is probably the poorest way of implementing
such a function and it is expectedly slow. I've already written some
vectorized functions, but I'm afraid that I'm missing the "big picture" in
this case, I don't know how to start. Probably I could build a 3 x
(length(x) * length(y) * length(z)) matrix holding each possible parameter
combinations. With my current step-size and value range that would be
slightly more than 2,000,000 triples, so that should not be a problem. Then
comes the part I'm totally clueless about, that is applying the target
function to each of the triples in the matrix in an efficient way. From the
resulting vector I could then easily take the minimum value index and get
the parameters from the parameter matrix.

Could someone kindly give me a hint how this could be implemented?

Thanks a lot,

Daniel


Code Snippet:
fullEnumeration <- function(par, stepSize = c(.03, .03, .03))
{
   res <- Inf

   best.x <- -1
   best.y <- -1
   best.z <- -1

   stepx <- stepSize[1]
   stepy <- stepSize[2]
   stepz <- stepSize[3]
   x <- seq(.01, 2, by=stepx)
   y <- seq(.01, 2, by=stepy)
   z <- seq(.01, 15, by=stepz)

   for (i in 1:length(x))
    for (j in 1:length(y))
        for (k in 1:length(z))
        {
		# Pass the current best result to the function being minimized to allow
for early termination
            newRes <- fun(c(x[i], y[j], z[k]), par, res)
            if (!is.na(newRes) && newRes < res)
            {
                res = newRes
                best.x <- x[i]
                best.y <- y[j]
                best.z <- z[k]
            }

        }
   return (c(
        best.x,
        best.y,
        best.z))

}

fun <- function(x, par, currentBestValue=Inf)
{
  x = x[1]
  y = x[2]
  z = x[3]
  TMax <- length(par)

  result <- 0
  for (myT in 1:TMax)
  {
    result <- result +
    (
    ((x * z) / (y-1) * (1 - (z / (z + myT))^(y-1) ))
    - par[myT]
    )^2

    # Allow for short-cut evaluation if running in complete enumeration mode

    if (is.na(result) || currentBestValue < result)
    {
        return (Inf)

I believe the following is what you are after. Because only division by 
a constant is involved, you are not likely to find anything in the R 
documentation about this.

boxplot ( (time/60) ~ movement*scene, ylab = "Time (minutes)", xlab = 
"Condition")

I am not sure what "Java Plugin" you refer to. Updates to the OS X
versions of JSE and JDK are at the Apple Developer Connection,
the JDK is currently at 1.4.1 DP 5. It may be, however, that only
developers in the select program can get at the recent updates.

I did not follow this thread, but what precisely is the problem (on
Darwin) ?

Dear Simon,

How about boxplot ( time/60 ~ movement*scene, ylab = "Time (minutes)", xlab 
= "Condition")?

Is that what you need?

Divide it by 60?

  tminutes<-time/60
  boxplot ( tminutes~movement*scene, ylab = "Time (minutes)", xlab =
	"Condition")
or just
   boxplot ( I(time/60)~movement*scene, ylab = "Time (minutes)", xlab =
	"Condition")

I was asked to expand on the point below

  >You shouldn't use fm1$residuals --- the S language doesn't prevent you
  >from accessing internal fields of objects directly, but it's still a bad
  >idea, especially if you don't know what they mean.

So here's a brief lecture:

One of the main purposes of objects in programming is to hide
implementation details from users.  This has two benefits: you can change
the implementation without breaking other people's code, and you can have
the same interface for a wide variety of objects with very different
internal implementations. In morerigorously object-oriented languages
there is no access to the internals of an object --- you can only use the
supplied accessor functions.

In S, things are less dictatorial.  You *can* use model$residuals to
access the residuals component of a glm directly, or you can use the accessor
function resid(model).  You still *should* use the accessor function where
possible.

One reason is that the internal structure is often not documented and
is subject to change. As it happens, the $residuals component of a glm is
documented and probably reasonably stable, but the internal workings of eg
a coxph object in the survival package are much less stable from version
to version and are not documented.

In addition, the accessor functions are similar across different models,
so it's easier to learn R if you use them.  The command resid(model)
returns some sensible type of residual for all regression models, and
where appropriate it has a type="" option to specify other types of
residuals.  It's a lot harder to keep track of which component of the
object contains the residuals -- and there's no guarantee that there will
be one.

The glm object provides a nice example.  The $residuals component contains
the working residuals, which are probably not the ones you want.  You are
more likely to want the deviance or Pearson residuals, which are only
available through the resid() function.

Another good example is the vcov() function that returns the covariance
matrix of the coefficient estimates.  This is typically not a component of
the model object (except sometimes). It's often a component of the value
returned by summary(), but even then it has different names for different
models.

You need to INSTALL your package (as `libraries' are really called in R).
That will automatically set up all the documentation files you need.

The help directory does not contain .Rd files: it contains text files
translated by Rdconv.

Writing R Extensions starts

Creating R packages

Packages provide a mechanism for loading optional code and attached
documentation as needed. The R distribution provides several packages,
such as eda, mva, and stepfun.

In the following, we assume that you know the library() command, including
its lib.loc argument, and we also assume basic knowledge of R CMD INSTALL.
Otherwise, please look at R's help pages

?library
?INSTALL

before reading on.

I'm not sure that I follow this. My newer configuration uses some stuff in 
the XEmacs pc package, and perhaps that's causing difficulties. You could 
change the pc-behaviour-level  variable near the top of the init file, or 
edit the file.

I believe that this is part of the standard 21.4.10 XEmacs installation, 
but I may be mistaken.

That might very well be the case. I haven't tried any of this except with 
version 21.4.10, and I should make that clear that in the document. I'm 
collecting comments and suggestions and will make changes some time soon. 
In the meantime, I hope that it's clear that until the version number 
reaches 1.0, things may change unpredictably!

Yes. There was a small problem with graphics Windows that's mostly 
corrected in the newer file.

Thank you for the kind remarks.

Subject: [R] Plotting continuous line types w/large datasets
Message-ID: <200211251917.gAPJHhK04224@bigtooth.cc.gatech.edu>

Hi, R-Folks,

I have 3 large datasets that I combined in a single plot with

plot(ecdf(x1...),...)
plot(ecdf(x2...),add=TRUE,...)
plot(ecdf(x3...),add=TRUE,...)

The datasets are very similar, so it is difficult to get visual
separation among them. I tried many different line types without
success -- the lines all came out solid. Checking further, plot.ecdf()
calls plot.stepfun(), which calls segments() between each pair of
points to plot. Since the points are so close together the lty
parameter becomes meaningless, which is why the lines come out solid.
I modified plot.stepfun() to call lines() for the whole vector of
points, but this didn't seem to help. So my question is: is there a
call I can make to plot a large dataset where the specified line type
gets "continued" through all the points? Or perhaps someone can suggest
a workaround.

Thanks,
Richard

Changing the colour might work better.

All the step function plotting seems afflicted by this. Compare

  plot(sort(x),(1:10000)/10000, type="s", lty="dashed")
  plot(sort(x),(1:10000)/10000, type="l", lty="dashed")

The latter might lead to a passable workaround.

Subject: [R] Pspline smoothing
Message-ID: <a05200f0cba0839eb282c@[134.153.109.176]>

Dear all,

I'm trying to use the Pspline add-on package to fit a quintic spline 
(norder =3), but I keep running into a Singularity error.

>  traj.spl <- smooth.Pspline(time, x, norder=3 )
Error in smooth.Pspline(time, x, norder = 3) :

Playing around with the other parameters produces an "unused arguments" error:

Error in smooth.Pspline(time, x, norder = 3, cv = FALSE, method = 3) :

Has anybody been able to fit quintic splines with Pspline or has some

Hi all. A simple question.

Supose that I have a vector beta <- c(1,2,3)
I need a vector which indice i be beta[i]*sum(beta[-i])
For example,
result <- rep(0,3)
for(i in 1:3) result[i] <- beta[i]*sum(beta[-i])
result
[1] 5 8 9
How I do it with no for?
Thanks in advance.

Without looking closer, I think this is a very nice example for a piece
of code that should be implemented in either C or Fortran (on the one
hand it is easy to implement, on the other hand its "S interpreted"
execution takes quite a long time). OK, quite a few possible
improvements of the R code are obvious, but I don't think this is the
best point to start ...

Nevertheless, the code looks like you are searching on a grid. Are you
really sure whether there is no method in optim() which performs better?

Subject: [R] How top print intermediate values from inside a function?
Message-ID: <1064fd1055cc.1055cc1064fd@jhsph.edu>

Hi:

In R, how do I display some intermediate results calculated in a "for" 
loop within a function?  For example, in the attached code, how do I 
get it to print the intermediate variable "mh.new" for each simulation, 
when I call the function "MHsim.ind"?

thanks for any help,
Ravi.

####################################################################
MHsim.ind <- function(nsim=1000,start=0,spread=1,likfn=bpllkd){
# Independence Metropolis algorithm with candidate density a 
#multivariate Student t-distribution with 1 degree of freedom, whose 
#mean and variance are taken to be MLE and its covariance matrix
mh.0 <- start
npar <- length(start)
mh.sim <- matrix(0,nrow=nsim,ncol=npar)

i <- 0

while (i < nsim){
	mh.new <- mvrnorm(n=1,mu=rep(0,npar),Sigma=spread)/
		sqrt(rchisq(n=1,df=1)/1) + start
	ratio <- exp(-likfn(mh.new)+ likfn(mh.0))* dmvt(mh.0, mu=start, 
sigma=spread)/dmvt(mh.new, mu=start, sigma=spread)
	if (is.nan(ratio)) next
	i <- i+1
	if (runif(1) < ratio) {mh.0 <- mh.sim[i,] <- mh.new}
	else mh.sim[i,] <- mh.0
}
mh.sim

Probably you are right about C and Fortran. But coming from the combination
of Java and Windows it's hard to overcome one's inhibitions and get started
with C :-). Beside that I'm specifically trying to improve my R-skills a
little because I wrote quite a lot of code for my thesis with R and
therefore I'm curious for better "code patterns".  In my R-code I vectorized
the function fun (thanks Patrick), seems to run somehow faster already.

I tried them but was not successful yet. The search range is constrained,
and Nelder-Mead doesn't use constraints. L-BFGS-B handles the constraints,
but it isn't able to handle functions with poles. The other ones did not
qualify for the same reasons.

I wonder if a grid-search is a very unusual case or if there might be a need
for a fast and generic implementation of such an algorithm.

time <- 1:100
x <- rnorm(100)
traj.spl <- smooth.Pspline(time, x, norder=3 )

works for me.  It's probably something specific to your data.  However,
the defaults spar=0, method=1 are not sensible: they are asking for
a perfect fit. At least try method=3.

?smooth.Pspline does not have argument cv listed for smooth.Pspline,
so no wonder it does not work.

That's *length* 1, not value 1. It's also sm.spline not smooth.Pspline.

I suspect that if you read the help page accurately you can find ways
to do what you want.  I suggest starting with the defualt settings of
sm.spline until you understand those of smooth.Pspline.

Excuse me, but I wasn't clear. It's a generic funcion, like
f(beta) and g(beta)

result<-rep(0,3)
for(i in 1:3) result[i]<-sum(f(beta[-i])/g(beta[-i]))

for example, f(beta)=log(abs(beta)) and g(beta)=beta^2:
for(i in 1:3) result[i]<-sum(log(abs(beta[-i]))/(beta[-i]^2))

How can I write this with no for?

Thanks and excuses by the lost time.

Subject: [R] How top print intermediate values from inside a function?
Message-ID: <11a7b911f17c.11f17c11a7b9@jhsph.edu>

Hi:

I tried both "print(mh.new)" and "cat(mh.new)", but the results are 
displayed only after all the computations inside the function are 
completed.  Is there a way to display the intermediate variable 
immediately after it is evaluated?

thanks again,
Ravi.

The same principle applies, as long as f() and g() are vector functions.

i.e. sum(F(beta[-i])) = sum(F(beta)) - F(beta[i])
where F() = f()/g()

Viz:
> result <- rep(0, 3)
> beta <- 1:3
> for(i in 1:3) result[i] <- sum(log(abs(beta[-i]))/(beta[-i]^2))

Windows, right? There's a checkbox for "buffered output" or something
like that in the menus. Uncheck it.

The same thing works, essentially. Assuming f, g are vectorized, 

foo <- log(abs(beta))/(beta^2)  ## in general f(beta)/g(beta)
result <- sum(foo) - foo

Dear R experts,

Is there any function in R that I can calculate the permutation lists?  I 
would like to know if there is any generic one for finding all the 
permutation of n choose k?

For example:

perms <- list(1:2)
perms <- add.ttt(3:4, perms)
should give me
 > perms
[[1]]
[1] 3 4 1 2

[[2]]
[1] 3 1 4 2

[[3]]
[1] 3 1 2 4

and perms <- add.ttt(5:6, perms)
should give me:
[[1]]
[1] 5 6 3 4 1 2

[[2]]
[1] 5 3 6 4 1 2

[[3]]
[1] 5 3 4 6 1 2

[[4]]
[1] 5 3 4 1 6 2

[[5]]
[1] 5 3 4 1 2 6

[[6]]
[1] 5 6 3 1 4 2

[[7]]
[1] 5 3 6 1 4 2

[[8]]
[1] 5 3 1 6 4 2

[[9]]
[1] 5 3 1 4 6 2

[[10]]
[1] 5 3 1 4 2 6

[[11]]
[1] 5 6 3 1 2 4

[[12]]
[1] 5 3 6 1 2 4

[[13]]
[1] 5 3 1 6 2 4

[[14]]
[1] 5 3 1 2 6 4

[[15]]
[1] 5 3 1 2 4 6


This example is just for those with k=2.  How would I calculate those for 
any k?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Pauline

The gregmisc package contains a function 'perumutations' which generates all
permutations of n choose r.  It also contains 'combinations' which generates
all combinations, and which appears to match your example:

Message-ID: <005301c2952e$589fd820$5c13070a@it.giustizia.it>

Dear all,
I'm writing a package where the main function fn(), say, returns a glm-like
object, with three additional components.
> obj<-glm(....)
> out<-fn(obj,....)
out is substantially an updated version of obj, with the same response and
some (two or three) additional variables in the linear predictor.
My problem is that out is much bigger than obj, and the three additional
components don't seem responsible, as they are quite small.

> class(obj)
[1] "glm" "lm"
> class(out)
[1] "myclass" "glm"       "lm"

> object.size(obj)

> object.size(out)
[1] 2701292

Why is out so larger than obj? the additional components are rather small
and the remaining ones seem approximatevely the same.
Many thanks,
vito

Just for fun two steps on the way to faster code:

   res <- Inf
   seqpar <- seq(along = par)
   best <- rep(-1, 3)

   y <- seq(.01, 2, by = stepSize[2])
   z <- seq(.01, 15, by = stepSize[3])
   for (xi in x)
     for (yj in y)
       for (zk in z){

That changes the sizes of the components of the glm fit, and some vary
with the square of the number of columns in the model matrix.  You are not
comparing like with like.

Why is this a problem?

I've the following problem:
The below function runs a loop with regression analysis and stores F-Stat
in a matrix. When I call the matrix elements (models[i,j]) in the function
I get proper results, but when I try to call  the same elements outside the
function the matrix appears to be empty e.g when I call compt inside the
function I get: 5 but when I call it outside I get: 1. This is the same
problem with models which appears to be empty outside the function.
Specifically I would like being able to  run the same function for various
data frames and store the results in the same matrix (models) one after the
other.

# Set general variables & matrix
myDataFrame <- read.table("path",header=T)
models <- matrix(nrow = 20, ncol =8)
X <- matrix(nrow = 1, ncol = 6)
compt <- 1
deb <- 0
fin <- 0

# Runsanalysis
myFunction <- function(IndDF)
{
     indDF <- as.data.frame(IndDF)
     for (i in 2:(length(IndDF)-1))
     {
          for (j in ((i+1):(length(IndDF))))
          {
               for (k in 0:5)
               {
                    deb <- dim(IndDF)[1]-k*21-100
                    fin <- dim(IndDF)[1]-k*21
                    X[1,k+1] <- lm((IndDF[,i])[deb:fin]~(IndDF
[,j])[deb:fin]))$fstat
               }
               if (0.39*X[1,1]+0.25*X[1,2]+0.16*X[1,3]+0.10*X[1,4]
+0.06*X[1,5]+0.04*X[1,6] > 5)
               {
                    models[compt,1] <- "ind"
                    models[compt,2] <-
substr(as.character(names(IndDF)[i]),2,7)
                    models[compt,3] <-
substr(as.character(names(IndDF)[j]),2,7)
                    models[compt,6] <- 0.39*X[1,1]+0.25*X[1,2]+0.16*X[1,3]

                    compt <- compt+1
               }

Subject: [R] Defining a Design Matrix for Correlation
Message-ID: <EXECMAIL.1021126115756.A@UNIVERSI-ISEUQ0.ucc.hull.ac.uk>


Dear list

I am using the 'geese' command in the geepack Package add-on to R.

I am wanting to define my own correlation matrix for 4 time occasions 
such that there is correlation between times 1&2, 1&3, 2&4 and 3&4 but 
not 1&4 and 2&3.

There is an option to define a design matrix called zcorr. Could anyone
tell me how I can create this design matrix such that it will show the 
correlations that I need to include?

Many thanks
Laura

The mgcv and gss packages will both let you fit higher order splines
(penalized regression splines in mgcv and full splines in gss). In mgcv
it's something like:

time <- 1:100
x <- rnorm(100)
gam(x~s(time,m=3)) # default basis dimension 10 p.r. spl.
gam(x~s(time,m=3,k=100)) # use full smoothing spl. 

(the latter is not a good idea if number of data is large!)

Well, beside this remark on the completely nonsensical subject of this
message, I'd suggest to read the manual "An Introduction to R" or other
introductory literature.
Please try to understand the scoping rules. You need to return() values
from the function, in any other case the environment the function is
executed in will be deleted after execution (this summary is too short,
but I don't want to rewrite existing literature).

Hi,

You can generate the combinations (package gregmisc) of the data.frame
indexes. With them, you get data.frame's columns based on those indexes and
finally you can pass them to the chiq.test function.

I have a data frame with about 60 columns.
I would like to run a chisq.test on all possible pairs of columns and on all
triples.
Is there an easy way to do it ?

Please use a more meaningful subject.  Some might take it as a spam and hit
the delete button.

Objects in the workspace are visible inside functions, but are usually not
directly manipulated inside functions.  When you modify an object in the
workspace inside a function, what actually happens is a local copy is made,
reflecting the modifications you made, and leave the one in the workspace
untouched.

Here's a simple example:

> x <- 10
> f <- function() { print(x); x <- 5; print(x) }
> f()
[1] 10
[1] 5
> x
[1] 10

I suppose the "usual" way of doing what you wanted to do is make the objects
you want inside the function (rather than the workspace), and return a list
containing them.  E.g., something like:


myFunction <- function(IndDF)
{
     models <- matrix(nrow = 20, ncol =8)
     X <- matrix(nrow = 1, ncol = 6)
     compt <- 1
     indDF <- as.data.frame(IndDF)
     for (i in 2:(length(IndDF)-1))
     {
     [whatever you need to do...]
     }
     return(list(models = models, compt = compt))
}

I've the following problem:
The below function runs a loop with regression analysis and stores F-Stat
in a matrix. When I call the matrix elements (models[i,j]) in the function
I get proper results, but when I try to call  the same elements outside the
function the matrix appears to be empty e.g when I call compt inside the
function I get: 5 but when I call it outside I get: 1. This is the same
problem with models which appears to be empty outside the function.
Specifically I would like being able to  run the same function for various
data frames and store the results in the same matrix (models) one after the
other.

# Set general variables & matrix
myDataFrame <- read.table("path",header=T)
models <- matrix(nrow = 20, ncol =8)
X <- matrix(nrow = 1, ncol = 6)
compt <- 1
deb <- 0
fin <- 0

# Runsanalysis
myFunction <- function(IndDF)
{
     indDF <- as.data.frame(IndDF)
     for (i in 2:(length(IndDF)-1))
     {
          for (j in ((i+1):(length(IndDF))))
          {
               for (k in 0:5)
               {
                    deb <- dim(IndDF)[1]-k*21-100
                    fin <- dim(IndDF)[1]-k*21
                    X[1,k+1] <- lm((IndDF[,i])[deb:fin]~(IndDF
[,j])[deb:fin]))$fstat
               }
               if (0.39*X[1,1]+0.25*X[1,2]+0.16*X[1,3]+0.10*X[1,4]
+0.06*X[1,5]+0.04*X[1,6] > 5)
               {
                    models[compt,1] <- "ind"
                    models[compt,2] <-
substr(as.character(names(IndDF)[i]),2,7)
                    models[compt,3] <-
substr(as.character(names(IndDF)[j]),2,7)
                    models[compt,6] <- 0.39*X[1,1]+0.25*X[1,2]+0.16*X[1,3]
+0.10*X[1,4]+0.06*X[1,5]+0.04*X[1,6]

}

I didn't mention that different colors is not an option. But actually
on more investigation it appears that I'm wrong about whether the line
type is continued through the line. what I needed to do was to specify
the lty as something like "F7" (which I was already doing) and also set
lwd higher since the units in the lty are proportional to lwd:

x <- seq(1,100000,1)
plot(x,x,lty="F7",type="l",lwd=2)

So modifying plot.stepfun() so that it uses lines() instead of segments()
and then using the above parameters will work.

Thanks,
Richard

Hi,

Well you can produce JPEG, PNG or BMP images directly from R and later you
can transform the image to the desired type of file format with another
second program (one that provide the feature you need is, ImageMagick).

Almost any way you like, then import into Adobe PhotoShop 6/7 and produce
CMYK output.

Given that `CMYK' is not a standard (you have to know what the numbers are
going to mean on the output device), the only reliable way I know is to
use a tool like PhotoShop that is set up to do colour profiling.  There
are all sorts of problems, like the restricted gamut of most CMYK devices.

Is there any more sophisticated way how to identify the dataset

On slightly related theme -- is there anyway how to make these
EPS pictures less bulky? I am writing a paper with couple of
pairs() and they are all 600k, 800k, etc. And it is really heck
of waiting to work with them (moreover, currently it is three
pages, but PDF file is already 1MB). However, I would prefer to
use EPS before PNG/BMP (which would be probably smaller and
faster) because of device independency.

Any thoughts on that?

Thanks for your time and effort on this Marc.  Unfortunately, Apple has
"integrated" Java into Mac OS X (Darwin) and, according to a tech at
Apple, I cannot simply get a new Java plug-in.  I must wait for an
update
of OS X.  So much for Java being platform independent.  BTW, I've tried
Netscape 7, IE 5.2 (both OS X) and Mozilla 1.0 and Opera (version?)
(both
Darwin), all with the same problem.  In the meantime, I'm using the
help.search() and help() combo.  However, I seem to recall reading some
place that an earlier version of Netscape (4.x?) has its own Java
component and, presumably, would not depend on an external plug-in.
If/when I decide to investigate this, I'll report accordingly.  Thanks
again!

Subject: [R] Existence of non-vectorised functions
Message-ID: <192a8c194812.194812192a8c@jhsph.edu>

Dear R-Group:

Recently, I ran into a problem.  I was using a function called "I.1", 
which evaluates the first-order modified Bessel function of the first 
kind, in the package "CircStats". This function is not vectorized, 
since it uses a couple of "if" conditions.  However, when I called this 
function with a vector argument, I got no error/warning messages in 
R1.5.1 (under Windows 2000). Furthermore, the results were generally 
incorect (please see the attached results).  However, if I vectorized 
it using "ifelse" everything is fine (I created a function 
called "myI.1" to do this).  I was wondering if there are functions in 
other packages, where such problems exist due to non-vectorization?

thanks,
Ravi.

Subject: [R] how to identify the outliers
Message-ID: <51F9C42DA15CD311BD220008C707D81906FFC923@usrymx10.merck.com>

First, a bit of retoric:

Rejecting data points solely on the ground of being "statistical outliers"
probably should be outlawed.  (Sounds like that's what you're trying to do.)
You need to investigate these data points so that you understand the reason
for their "outlyingness" before you decide whether their exclusion make
sense or not.  Exclusion based purely on statistical criteria almost
guarantee irreproducible research.

Some explanation:  Any "statistical outliers" are with reference to a model
(formal or conceptual).  They reflect lack of fit of the model to the data.
Rejecting these data points on statistical ground means you believe the
model more than the data, which not such a good idea for scientific
research.

The "outliers" indicated by boxplots are based on a criterion (something
like the upper/lower hinges +/- k*IQR, where k is either 1.5 or 3, see
?boxplot.stats for some definitions).  Actually boxplot.stats gives you the
limits boxplot() used to identify outliers.

Hello R-users,

Is there any more sophisticated way how to identify the dataset 
outliers other then seeing them in boxplot? I wanna exclude them from
further analysis and I am interested in their position in my vector
data.

Dear Rado,

I do not know how your data looks like, but generally you can use robust
Mahalanobis distances. That is, compute robust mean and covariance matrix
by cov.rob (method="mcd") in Library lqs, and put these as center and cov
into the function mahalanobis. As cutoff value you can take a large
quantile (say 0.999) of the chi^2-distribution with p (number of your
variables) degrees of freedom. Details in Rousseeuw & van Driessen, see
help page on cov.rob.

Hello,

to my knowledge either by highlighting the text and using the menu
edit->copy of GUI or if you are running R with Emacs-ESS you can implement
the cua-mode into your _emacs-file. Pls, see the link below for further
information on cua.

Subject: [R] Problem with accented characters in portuguese
Message-ID: <200211261713.44240.ltorgo@liacc.up.pt>

Dear all,
I've recently encountered a strange behaviour when using R with portuguese 
accented characters. The most curious aspect is that using the same code with 
ESS under XEmacs the behaviour is different.
My system is:

> R.version
         _              
platform i386-pc-mingw32
arch     i386           
os       mingw32        
system   i386, mingw32  
status                  
major    1              
minor    6.1            
year     2002           
month    11             
day      01             
language R

Here it goes a trace of the "problem":

First under Rgui

> sal?rio <- 45    # this is ok!
> sal?rio
[1] 45
> objects()
[1] "sal?rio"
> d <- data.frame(sal?rio=c(34,45),name=c('xyz','fgd')) # this is NOT ok!
> d
  sal.rio name
1      34  xyz
2      45  fgd

> d$sal?rio
NULL
> d$sal.rio
[1] 34 45


Now with ESS 5.1.20 under XEmacs 21.4

> sal?rio <- 45
> sal?rio
[1] 45
> d <- data.frame(sal?rio=c(34,45),name=c('xyz','fgd'))
> 
> d
  sal?rio name
1      34  xyz
2      45  fgd
> d$sal?rio
[1] 34 45


Another "funny" thing about this is that is does not happens with all accented 
characters of Portuguese. Check this trial whether I've used a column with a 
name using almost all accented characters of Portuguese:

In Rgui

> d2 <- data.frame(??????????????=c(34,45),name=c('xyz','fgd'))
> d2
  X.??????????.?? name
1              34  xyz
2              45  fgd

As you can see the problem occurs with ? and ?, and not with the other 
accented characters.

In Ess:

> d2 <- data.frame(??????????????=c(34,45),name=c('xyz','fgd'))
> d2
  ?????????????? name
1             34  xyz
2             45  fgd


Thank you for any help.

Hi,

Yes, at least for JPEG, you can define the level of compression (see the
help file for that "jpeg") and the smaller it is the bigger is the file, but
the higher is the compression the lower is the quality of the picture. You
decide your satisfaction level. In any case, in terms of size, PNG's format
gets lower file sizes.

Carlos.

On slightly related theme -- is there anyway how to make these
EPS pictures less bulky? I am writing a paper with couple of
pairs() and they are all 600k, 800k, etc. And it is really heck
of waiting to work with them (moreover, currently it is three
pages, but PDF file is already 1MB). However, I would prefer to
use EPS before PNG/BMP (which would be probably smaller and
faster) because of device independency.

Any thoughts on that?

Subject: [R] filled.contour and points
Message-ID: <200211261707.gAQH7PF4122788@odds.stat.purdue.edu>


I was trying to add points to filled.contour plots, but the
points(...) function apparently uses a different coordinate system
than the filled.contour(...) function; it appears that points(...)
paints points where they would be if the contours were stretched over
the whole plotting frame including the legend bar.  Am I missing
something or is it a "misalignment" in the code?

BTW, I have no problem adding points to regular contour plots.

Message-ID: <9153F74610B7D311B83900902771C8710A4CEFC9@axcs07.cos.agilent.com>

RPART doesn't seem to handle the degenerate case when all training 
samples are drawn from a single class:

  > TrainType
  [1] 0 0 0 0
  > TrainDat
           V1        V2        V3        V4        V5

Conversely TREE had no problem with this test case, even if the features
are also degenerate (same features for each sample).

Is this expected behavior from RPART or a bug? This is with R1.6.1 on NT4.

Highlight it in the console or pager and use Edit|Copy?

If that's not you want to do please be more specific.  (R-devel has
functions to work with the clipboard, and you may want to compile that up
and make use of those.)

That should be "rhetoric", but "propaganda" is probably closer to what I

These are vector format and each plotted data point, each line etc. is
represented in the file, so size can be modelled as lm(size ~
number.of.elements) (yes, including an intercept). ;-)

Subject: [R] Reshape by multiple variables
Message-ID: <Pxp3hIA2J749EwfA@toastyhamster.karoo.co.uk>

Dear list

I'm using the reshape command and want to reshape a wide data set to a
long one 

e.g. I have the variables y1,y2,y3,age1,age2,age3,sex,ethnic

I want my new long data set to consist of the variables y (which has
been created from y1,y2,y3), age (which has been created from
age1,age2,age3), sex and ethnic

I have tried to use the command:

data1<-reshape(data,varying=list(c("y1","y2","y3"),c("age1","age2","age"
)),v.names="y","age", times=1:3,direction="long")

but it tells me I am trying to duplicate row names?

How can I put multiple time-varying variables into the varying bit?

Thanks for any help
Laura

That's extremely probable. It depends on the package author and the
complexity of the problem, thus you have to check it yourself whether it
works vectorized or not, e.g. in the help files.

BTW: You might want to send your improvements of I.1() to the package
author as well (or even at first - hint, hint) ...

Subject: [R] filled.contour and points
In-Reply-To: <200211261707.gAQH7PF4122788@odds.stat.purdue.edu>
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10211260953230.10773-100000@fisher.stat.ucla.edu>

In the help page for filled.contour() it says that you have insert code
which adds to the plot via the 'plot.axes'.  For example,

> a  <- matrix(0, 10, 10)
> x <- runif(10)
> y <- runif(10)
> filled.contour(a, plot.axes = points(x, y))

However, if you do this, you'll notice the axes are gone.  You need to
include explicit calls to axis() to solve this problem:

> filled.contour(a, plot.axes = { points(x, y); axis(1); axis(2) })

You can put a lot of code in the 'plot.axes' argument (using text(),
points(), lines(), etc.) and make really nice plots.

This is a function of your OS: you haven't told us the version of Windows,
nor what locale it thinks you are in, nor if you are using Rterm or Rgui.
But it doesn't really matter, as we can't do anything about it. Some
aspect of Windows seems to think some of your accented characters are not
valid in the locale it thinks you are in.  That you are seeing difference
probably reflect different codepages.

Maybe it was not clear on my message but I did mentioned that I'm using Rgui.

Regarding the Windows version it is Windows 2000 Professional.

Moreover, the problem does not seem to be a OS or locale problem, as I'm using 
the same locale under ESS or under Rgui and the behaviour is different. 
Moreover, using exactly the same portuguese word (sal?rio) under two 
different contexts, one as an object name, and the other as a data frame 
column name, the behaviour of R is different (but only under Rgui and not 
under ESS, as I've tried to shown on the trace I've send in the previous 
message).

In any case my locale info (on both ESS and Rgui) is:

On Rgui:
> Sys.getlocale()
[1] 
"LC_COLLATE=Portuguese_Portugal.1252;LC_CTYPE=Portuguese_Portugal.1252;LC_MONETARY=C;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=Portuguese_Portugal.1252"

On ESS:

> Sys.getlocale()

Reflecting a bit more on this issue I think a possible explanation for this 
different behaviour is that ESS uses Rterm and not Rgui, which means that 
Rterm and Rgui apparently are acting differently with the same instructions, 
in spite of the locale information and OS settings being exactly the same.

Subject: [R] Another Mozilla issue
Message-ID: <3DE3C468.8C2E7A37@noaa.gov>

This isn't an R issue per se, but given the recent issues with Mozilla
and help.search(), I figured I'd float it. I use mozilla on a WIN2000
box. I was using 1.0 and the help.search() wasn't working as has been
discussed over the past few days. Yesterday I upgraded to 1.1, and the
javascript help still does not work. (I checked and it is enabled.)
Another problem I noticed this morning while reading the R digest is
that the < and > symbols now display as ? in my email (Netscape Mail,
4.78). So in the digest instead of seeing <- I see ?-, which is mildly
annoying. Seems like a font issue, but I don't know what to track down.
Anyone experience this?

The command you gave has two clear errors: you forgot the 3 on age3 and
you didn't use c() around the v.names argument.  Even so, I don't get an
error message from it (just the wrong result).

With these corrected it works for me:

Thanks to Uwe Ligges and Ben Bolker for their responses.  My main concern
was with the fact that R doesn't issue a warning when the user attempts an
"if" test with a vector argument.  Splus (at least Splus 6) does do this,
saying that only the first element is used in testing the condition. I feel
that R should also give this warning.

thanks again,
Ravi.

Robert,

You need to be sure that you also have Java installed and enabled in
order for the help.start() based search to work.  The
help.search("KeyWord") works within R, whereas the help.start() based
search requires a Java/JavaScript enabled broswer.

I have a dual-boot WinXP Pro/RH 8.0 Linux system and am using Mozilla
(1.1 under WinXP/1.3a under Linux) with both.

For Win2k, go to http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html, where
you can download the Java installer file.  This should be a file
called j2re-1_4_1_01-windows-i586.exe. Download and then run that
program to install Java on your system.

This process should install the Java plug-ins in "C:\Program
Files\mozilla.org\Mozilla\Plugins", which is the default install
location for Mozilla.

After installing Java, go back into Mozilla and enable Java.  Exit out
of Mozilla.  Then try help.start() in R and go to the search
engine/keywords page.

On the "<>" versus "?" in the R digest, I don't subscribe to the
digest, but it does sound either like a font or text encoding issue.
Check the default character coding configuration in the mail program
and be sure that it is set to one of the standard settings such as
"Western (ISO-8859-1)".

Hope that helps.

Marc Schwartz

Hello everyone.

If I do

f <- function(n){max(rnorm(n))}
plot(sapply(rep(5000,4000),f))   #[this takes my PC about 30 seconds]

then I get something quite unexpected: gaps in the distribution.  For
me, the most noticable one is at about 3.6.

Do others get this?  Is it an optical illusion?  It can't be right,
can it?  Or maybe I just don't understand the good ol' Gaussian very
well. 

anyone got an explanation?

Hi,

I have probably overlooked something obvious, but could anybody
help me with following, please?

Trying to make regression analysis. I have a huge dataframe with
results from National Opinion Survey on Crime and Justice
(www.abacon.com/fox/) with two variables G5 and N3 which are
imported to R as ordered factors:

	[4] "Disagree"          "Strongly disagree"
	> levels(noscj$N3)
	[1] "Serious problem"  "Somewhat problem" "Minor problem"  "Not
	a problem"
	>

(missing values are duly recoded as NA). When I try linear
regression I get a lot of warnings which I have not managed to
parse succesfully:

	> lm(G5 ~ N3,data=noscj)

This is also illuminative:

  plot(sort(sapply(rep(2000,2000),f)),type="l")

We've seen odd behaviour of max(rnorm()) with the default random generators
before. Switching to RNGkind("Wichmann-Hill") made the effect
disappear here. Same thing switching the normal generator with
RNGkind("Marsaglia-Multicarry","Box-Muller").

You can't do linear regression with an ordered factor as a response.
If you mean to code the levels you need to do so explicitly by
codes(G5).

Subject: [R] nlme: gnls with weights and correlation arguments
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211261701230.11190-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  Some students of mine are trying to use gnls, the generalized non-linear
least squares function within the nlme library, to study evolutionary
questions where correlations between traits at the species level are
non-independent because of the evolutionary relatedness of the species.  
Specifically, they're using a non-linear function (log(sexual dimorphism)  
~ log(a + b*variation in mating opportunities), an exponential spatial
correlation function that depends on the phylogenetic distance between
species [I hacked the library a little bit to allow one to specify a
distance matrix directly, rather than specifying spatial positions], and a
weight function that covaries as a power of the average body size.

  They are running into trouble when they try to fit models that have both
a non-trivial weights function and a non-trivial correlation function
specified.  We are still exploring the problem, trying different data
sets, etc., to narrow down the problem, but I just thought I would float
it here to see if this fairly vague description sparked any thoughts.  As
I understand it, they get sensible answers without specifying a weights
function, but when using the weights function (which seems justified by
the parameter values estimated), there is severe and somewhat weird
dependence on the starting conditions specified.  It doesn't appear to be
a simple problem of multiple modes or a very flat goodness-of-fit surface.

  (Emmanuel Paradis' ape package is an alternative approach to this 
problem, which we are aware of and may look into, but we'd like to try to 
sort this out if I can.)

  Any thoughts?

That's the maximum of 5000 normals, right?  That's pushing the accuracy of
some internal calculations too hard.

If you want to do this, you should use

RNGkind(, "Inversion")

That's not the default for back-compatibility reasons.

This is substantially the same as PR#1664.  The Marsaglia-Multicarry and
Kinderman-Ramage options don't play nicely together in the extreme tails
of the Normal distribution.

Changing the Normal generator
  RNGkind(normal="Inversion")
  RNGkind(normal="Box-Muller")
or the underlying uniform stream
  RNGkind(kind="Wichmann-Hill")
  RNGkind(kind="Super-Duper")
gives better looking results.

Dear Matej,

The response variable in a linear model fit by lm has to be a numeric 
variable. (The warnings are produced when lm tries to perform arithmetic 
operations on an ordered factor.) You could use as.numeric(G5) on the left 
hand side of the model, but you should probably think about whether you 
really want to fit a linear model to categorical data.

I hope that this helps,
  John

Well, all the warnings are of the form "  not meaningful for ordered
factors".  The problem is that lm is not meaningful for ordered factors.

You appear to want a linear regression model where the response is
1,2,3,4,5 according to the levels of G5. You need to define a variable
like that.  You can probably just use

numG5<-unclass(noscj$G5)

Subject: [R] independent bootstraps for difference of means
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10211261610020.2894-100000@fisher.stat.ucla.edu>

This question is for users of the `boot' library.  Can anyone tell me how
to bootstrap the difference means for two independent samples using the
boot() function?  For example, say I have samples x and y and I want to
bootstrap mean(x) - mean(y) by independently resampling x and y.  

At first I thought I could just do two separate bootstraps and then take
differences, but then you don't get the result in a "boot" object with the
nice print and summary methods.

Seems like a simple job but I can't seem to figure out a way.

Thanks,

-roger

If you are on Windows, this should work for you:

    plot(1:10, ylab="\211")

If you are on a Mac, "\344" might do the trick (can't check this myself
though).

On UNIX, I don't know how to display it on screen, but you can produce
postscript and/or pdf output by specifying Windows encoding and using
the example above, i.e., something like ...

    postscript(encoding="WinAnsi.enc")
    plot(1:10, ylab="\211")
    dev.off()

Hope that helps.

Well, I do think it IS silly idea (moreover, in one other case we
do regression analysis where dependent variable is sex -- which
seems to me really ugly), but it is my homework assignment from
statistics class. Not to make my instructor too silly, they have
the problem that an example dataset for the textbook has just one
interval variable. On the other hand instructor (James Fox, your
namesake BTW -- School of Criminal Justice at Northeastern
University, Boston, MA) is the author of the textbook so I think,
that there should be really TWO datasets (one for tests of
significance and variance and other one for regression
calculations) and that it is his fault after all.

Thanks for the help,

Thanks to everybody who answered to my query. Just to justify
myself in your eyes, let me tell you that a silly idea of doing
regression analysis on nominal variables is not mine, but of my
instructor in school.

Message-ID: <AF0250AF659F1A4C9A2EA2D0F0EFC6E3065506@hkjkex.hkijkt.fam>

Dear Rado, 
First I would do is to investigate the data I consider "outliers"; it
brings some consequences to exclude them IF the data are naturally
occur, and it means we lost them, otherwise we can exclude them.

However, I don't think you need a sophisticated way to do that since you
can run analyses like stepwise or robust analysis. 
Exclude one by one, and run your analysis to see how far the exclusion
will impact to your results, do this repeatedly. 
This is to avoid exclusion "valuable" data and important information in
every single data you have...

Alternatively, you can read Tukey's book " Exploratory Data analysis", I
don't have it now.

Cheers,

Eduwin

Dear Matej,
For your best information, you can read Draper and Smith, 1998 "Applied
Regression Analysis", I think this is the most cited literature for
regression analysis, or if you are facing with categorical data (like
what you are doing now) go with Hosmer and Lemeshow , 2002 "Applied
Logistic Regression"

Hope this help,

Subject: [R] further on ESS/XEmacs for Windows
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20021126211414.01ddcd70@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Dear list members,

I've had helpful feedback from a number of people, several of whom 
experienced some problems getting my XEmacs/ESS configuration files for 
Windows to work properly. I will, of course, make changes based on this 
feedback, but the following information may be of use in the interim:

(1) It's clear that my instructions and installation procedure were 
insufficiently flexible. In particular, putting the .xemacs configuration 
directory in c:\ caused some problems:

     On Windows 9x systems, it's necessary to have the environment variable 
HOME point to the directory in which .xemacs is located; for example, if 
this directory is in c:\, place the line

   set HOME=c:\

in the autoexec.bat file. As well, the proper way to redefine the path is

   path=%path%;"c:\program files\r\rw1061\bin"

(or wherever rterm.exe is). Again, this line goes in autoexec.bat.

     In Windows NT, 2000, or XP, if there is no HOME environment variable 
(the usual case), then XEmacs uses HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH to locate the 
.xemacs configuration directory. To see where XEmacs is looking, open a 
command prompt (DOS) window and type

   echo %homedrive%%homepath%

If the answer isn't c:\, then you can either move the .xemacs directory 
accordingly or define HOME=c:\

     As well, having my self-extracting archive try to place files in the 
right places was a mistake, I believe, since the locations are 
XEmacs-version dependent.

     These problems are easily dealt with, I believe, and I apologize for 
any frustration that my (poor) initial choices produced.

(2) I spent a good part of the day today trying XEmacs and ESS on a variety 
of Windows systems -- with and without my configuration files. I noticed a 
number of intermittent problems with GUI-related commands, such as attempts 
to open dialog boxes causing the R process to freeze. I'll try to track 
down the source of these problems.

Thanks for your patience.
  John

I'm not sure what the status of these is -- I do know that some people
I trust have wondered how the heck R even works under (X)Emacs on
Windows (issues arising with systems interfacing, blocking calls, and
similar "stuff").  

Note that I'm about 50% of the way to integrating John's work (along
with Tomy's (Thomas Gerd's) work for SAS) to provide toolbars.  I
expect it to be finished for the next release of ESS, so if you send
feedback privately to John, cc me if it is about problems (or you
might mention to him that you've not told me; I'll be in touch with
him).

This will simplify matters when I check in the new ESS stuff into the
XEmacs package archives, since it will mean that you can install via
the menu package items (similar to the R package installer menu
item).  

One question that has popped up is if the toolbar should be placed
somewhere else -- i.e. on the left or right sides -- I can make that
an option, defaulting to replacement of the top toolbar, or I could do
it VM style on the left side.  Thoughts?  

(probably the best reply to this would be to me, or we should move the
conversation over to the ess-help list).

best,
-tony

Hi Jarrett, 

(I am a little late joining this thread, but I hope this helps anyway).

An alternative way to search the help system that is not dependent on
Java is help.search().  This is a very fast way to search in the name,
alias, title and keywords fields. This produces a quick list on screen
of matches to the search. What was not immediately obvious to me when I
first used help.search() is that it produces an object which also
includes the URL to the help file (it *is* obvious if you read the help
file as I did... eventually :).  I like using text browsers (like lynx,
links and especially w3m) for their speed and have written a little
function that takes the output of help.search() and makes a webpage with
links to the relevant help files.  I have just made a slight change so
that the default R web browser can be used instead of a text browser -
see the code below. I have only used this on Linux but I hope it should
work on other platforms without too much work. I hope I'm not breaking
too many HTML and R conventions, but this is just meant to be a simple,
fast hack that seems to work for me.

I have set up the defaults for using a text browser (w3m in an xvt
terminal) so to use it you would do something like this:

## Search for "t-test" and display the results using w3m in 
## an xvt terminal:

rfind("t-test")

## Search for "t-test" and display using the default browser:

rfind("t-test", use.text = FALSE) 

Obviously you could make use.text.browser = FALSE the default setting in
the function and then you could just use rfind("t-test") and display in
the results your default brower.

Yes, it is a general recommendation.  We would have changed to inversion
apart from reproducibility issues.  Inversion was implemented in a way
that is very accurate, if a little bit slower than the other normal
generators supplied.  (You can do the timings yourself.)

It does not exist any more, and it has long not run under current versions
of R. (It's maintainer has not maintained it for a couple of years.)

The good news is that a replacement package ported by Charles Kooperberg
(the original author of polymars) is imminent.

Look in contrib/Devel for packages that recently have failed to work.

Subject: [R] dump() bug?
Message-ID: <200211270759.gAR7xAJQ002746@tahi.mcs.vuw.ac.nz>

Is this a bug?  Certainly it was not expected.  dump() seems to prefer a
global definition over a local one.  R 1.6.1 on Solaris 8 or NetBSD:

> ls()
character(0)
> dump("D", "D.q")	# a global D() exists
> system("cat D.q")
"D" <-
function (expr, name)
.Internal(D(expr, name))
> D <- function(x) print(x)	# now create a local one
> ls()
[1] "D"
> dump("D", "D.q")
> system("cat D.q")	# here's the surprise
"D" <-
function (expr, name)
.Internal(D(expr, name))
> 
The same thing happens with dump(list=ls(), "D.q").

If you use  library(help = "CircStats")
(something you should do for any package when you find problems!)
you see that it has been ported from S (probably S-plus).

In R, the Bessel functions have been available for long time,
in fast and vectorized form  --- although for "numeric" (i.e
non-complex) arguments only, and help(bessel) {e.g.} gives you

     besselI(x, nu, expon.scaled = FALSE)
     besselK(x, nu, expon.scaled = FALSE)
     besselJ(x, nu)
     besselY(x, nu)

i.e. I.0(x) = besselI(x,0) \
     I.1(x) = besselI(x,1)  > when x is numeric
     I.p(x) = besselI(x,p) /

Only if you are interested in the non-numeric complex case,
you (and even more the maintainer of CircStats) should
investigate improving I.1 (and I.p) to work vectorized and you
are right,  ifelse() might a good way to do so.

Message-ID: <71E1E30A-01DF-11D7-893F-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

I should be more specific here. It works if you use Mozilla 1.2 to go
directly to the SearchEngine.html page in your $R_HOME. But
if you use help.start() from R, you typically use Mozilla 1.1 from
fink (the GTK version), which does not work. A quick hack is not to
say help.start(), but to say

system(paste("open -a  
Mozilla",paste(Sys.getenv("R_HOME"),"/doc/html/index.html",sep="")))

This works for me and gives me the Carbon Mozilla 1.2. This does NOT  
work
with Navigator, OmniWeb, and fortunately also not with MSIE.

What also works is defining a script /usr/local/bin/netscape with

#!/bin/sh
open -a Mozilla /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html

and then using help.start().

Years ago I struggled with PostScript file sizes when I wrote a program
producing PS graphics with the DISLIN library (which is an excellent graphics
library, by the way). My initial file sizes were too big for my PC, and in
particular, for the tiny memory of the printer of those days. There indeed are
some tricks you can do, but unfortunately for you Matej, most of them are
already done in R, so you cannot improve much. However, you can influence `size'
in lm(size ~ number.of.elements) (but not the intercept). I guess that in
pairs() plots the bulk of the file size comes from the plotting symbols for
observations. Circles use a larger number of line segments than, say, triangles
(fortunately they are not real circles, which would use an infinite number of
line segments each in vector graphics). Depending on the way the symbols are
drawn, triangle may be the best choice, perhaps better than a cross or x. Point
may be still better, if that's a point indeed instead of being a crumbled
vector. Depending on the implementation, symbols in recognized PostScript fonts
may be still smaller. This, of course, requires that the driver uses PostScript
fonts instead of presenting them in vector (or pixel graphics). 

In my old DISLIN graphics I could reduce the file sizes by 70% (!) from the
original 1M+ when I used PostScript fonts in labels instead of HP Plotter
glyphs, and used triangles instead of circles as plotting characters. The former
is already done in R, so you can influence only the plotting character. 

Further trick that I used was that I wrote an "adaptive" curve plotting
function, which didn't represent the curve as a sequnece of, say, 101 vectors,
but started with a sparse grid of points and checked if the curve would change 
if I add a point between two existing points. So I used denser grid where the 
curve changed rapidly (in effect, had high second derivatives) and a sparse 
grid elsewhere. The result looked better (smoother) than with 101 points 
although I used on average some 35 points rationally positioned. I guess you 
can't easily have this added to your pairs() function, though, since that would 
require hacking the R sources. How much this would help, depends on the number 
of segments used originally for curves, and probably much less than the 
plotting symbols.

I hope this helps but probably it won't help very much. Big files are big 
files, what ever you do.

Subject: [R] dump() bug?

It is not a bug, but it may not be intended.  It is a consequence of
namespaces.  Since dump is in base, it searches base before the user's
workspace.  That is something that seems only to be documented in NEWS.

I don't follow your use of `local' and `global'.  Your `local' copy is in
.GlobalEnv, the global environment aka workspace!

Sounds like the natural way to fix this would be to add an envir=
argument, defaulting to parent.frame(), and pass it down to the
internal routine?

Hello Mohamed,

If I understand you correctly you are working on Windows and want to start
your R code at a given prespecified time? If so, you can achieve this by
executing your R code in a batch file (for this consult the FAQ and the
Introduction manual); set the execution time of this batch file via: Start
-> Settings -> Control Panel -> Scheduled Tasks in Windows.

HTH,
Bernhard

Dear Tony,

Please note that the problems that I've noted (beyond those produced by my 
inadequate instructions about where to put files) relate not to the 
toolbar, which seems to work fine, but to some of the menu items, which 
call up dialog boxes. I'm able to reproduce these problems without using my 
configuration file, by the way. As well, there are some problems that 
relate to graphics windows that also appear to be independent of my 
configuration.

Installation certainly will become simpler when my stuff gets folded into ESS.

(I decided to send my message to r-help because some people encountered 
difficulties that I hoped to clear up, and because I figured that someone 
there would have insight into the Windows problems.)

Regards,
  John

Dear readers of R-announce and R-help.
Yesterday, I sent a message with
   Subject: R-announce moved from majordomo to [procmail+mailman]
on Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2002 18:39:45 +0100
to R-announce and hence R-help.

Many of you will have received the message several times,
typically from half a dozen to about 25x.
I do apologize for this.  
The reason was the automatic gateway ("forwarding") of all
R-announce messages to R-help that accidentally produced a mail
loop.  I only found out relatively late (~ 20 min after
sending), and had to stop delivery entirely for which several of
you probably haven't received that message at all.

The new web interface to the list is now available at
    https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce
and particularly the __archive__ contains yesterday's message
as https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2002/000362.html
(and yes, you should accept the security certificate _once_).

Subject: [R] R on the Zaurus
Message-ID: <OFEJKEHLCPGGDMAIINLLKEBKCCAA.enpsgp@bath.ac.uk>

Hello All,

I have a working port of R on my SL5500. I've not tested the X windowing
support yet, but was more concerned about the accuracy of the fp emulation.

The following is the result of the test which Stuart Leask recommended I
should try:

Mandrake 8.2
> x<-NA
> is.na(x)
[1] TRUE
> x+1
[1] NA
> 2*x
[1] NA

Zaurus OZ3
> x<-NA
> is.na(x)
[1] TRUE
> x+1
[1] 1
> 2*x
[1] 8.29488e-311

Presumably this is the wrong answer. The question is whether it's the fault
of the Zaurus' fp emulation, or some sort of incompatibility with the way R
is written. Does anyone know for certain which it might be?

If it is a bug in the Zaurus' fp implementation then I don't see any real
troubles getting it fixed (I'm sure people will be keen to get this right).

I notice that there are two types of NaNs in the ieee 754 standard, QNaN
(Quiet NaN) and SNaN (Signalling NaN). Does 8.29488e-311 look familiar (I
didn't think so)?

Regards,


Simon

Actually this happens under emacs (21.2.1) as well as Xemacs 21.4.  I've
also seen this happening under the Rterm in version 1.6.1 for Windows.  What
I generally see is that the Rterm cannot quit and needs to be forced to
quite by some other means.

I'm not sure what the status of these is -- I do know that some people I
trust have wondered how the heck R even works under (X)Emacs on Windows
(issues arising with systems interfacing, blocking calls, and similar
"stuff").  

Note that I'm about 50% of the way to integrating John's work (along with
Tomy's (Thomas Gerd's) work for SAS) to provide toolbars.  I expect it to be
finished for the next release of ESS, so if you send feedback privately to
John, cc me if it is about problems (or you might mention to him that you've
not told me; I'll be in touch with him).

This will simplify matters when I check in the new ESS stuff into the XEmacs
package archives, since it will mean that you can install via the menu
package items (similar to the R package installer menu item).  

One question that has popped up is if the toolbar should be placed somewhere
else -- i.e. on the left or right sides -- I can make that an option,
defaulting to replacement of the top toolbar, or I could do it VM style on
the left side.  Thoughts?  

(probably the best reply to this would be to me, or we should move the
conversation over to the ess-help list).

best,
-tony

  I have hacked together some pre-existing code (using C code from TOMS
written by D. E. Amos) for computing complex Bessel functions.  I 
considered sending it in, but (1) it's part of a larger package I haven't 
cleaned up yet, (2) I wasn't sure about the licensing/redistribution 
implications of the ACM license (permission required for commercial use: 
http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/softwareCRnotice.html).
  If anyone would find it useful, drop me a line.

Subject: [R] Mozilla redux
In-Reply-To: <5.1.0.14.2.20021127073824.01efae40@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>
Message-ID: <003401c2961e$38640720$0201a8c0@MARC>

As an FYI to folks, I thought that I would just mention that Mozilla
V1.2 went to release yesterday. It may be prudent for folks using
Mozilla as their default browser to upgrade to this new version for
any of a number of reasons. The downloads of 1.2 are available here:

http://www.mozilla.org/releases/

The release notes for Mozilla 1.2 still suggest potential issues
relative to Java and these are located here:

http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.2/#install

and here:

http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.2/#java

Given the issues noted here of late, it would be my recommendation to
install Mozilla and then install/upgrade the appropriate version of
Java for your platform.  The notes above suggest possible fixes under
Windows/Linux/Unix if Java is not working for you, which have been
discussed here. Java V1.4.1 downloads are available for most platforms
here:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html

The install instructions on the Mozilla site for 1.2 on Mac platforms
suggest that Mozilla will use the version of Java already installed as
was mentioned here this week, but that for OS versions 8.5 to 8.6 you
may need to upgrade the Java runtime package. Links are provided in
the Mac install section of the release notes.

For those using Xft enabled Linux versions (like me), 1.2 supports
Xft, but it is not enabled in the binaries by default. Thus you would
have to compile your own from source using the "--enable-xft" option
or for RH 8.0 use the nightly V1.3a RPMS here:

http://komodo.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/experimental/gtk2/

The current roadmap for Mozilla 1.3 suggests a February 2003 release
target. Perhaps they'll get the Java plug-in issue resolved by
then....  :-)



I thought that I would pass this information on since Mozilla use has
been a notable issue when using the search facilities in R.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R] Error message: missing value where logical needed
Message-ID: <6000BB14AFA9A741BC2315A598837ED569351F@nihexchange4.nih.gov>

Dear all,

I often import data sets from other programs that contain user defined
missing values.  As an example consider a variable MXPLOCO with a user
defined missing value of as -9.

> summary(MXPLOCO)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
 -9.000   4.750   5.000   5.349   6.000   8.500   2.000

The following command successfully converts the value -9 to NA.  However, an
error message is also returned:

> for(i in 1:length(MXPLOCO)) {
+     if(MXPLOCO[i] == c(-9, NA)) MXPLOCO[i] <- NA
+     }
Error in if (MXPLOCO[i] == c(-9, NA)) MXPLOCO[i] <- NA : 
        missing value where logical needed
> summary(MXPLOCO)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
   4.00    5.00    5.00    5.54    6.00    8.50    3.00 

What is the meaning of the error message, and how can I resolve the error?

Thanks,

Maurice

Subject: [R] R genetics package now available
Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C202F2C30D@groexmb02.pfizer.com>


The "genetics" package for handling single-locus genetic data is now
available on CRAN in both source and Windows binary formats.  The purpose of
this package is to  make it easy to create and manipulate genetic
information, and to facility use of this information in statistical models.


The library includes classes and methods for creating, representing, and
manipulating genotypes (unordered allele pairs) and haplotypes (ordered
allele pairs).  Genotypes and
haplotypes can be annotated with chromosome, locus, gene, and marker
information. Utility functions compute genotype and allele frequencies, flag
homozygotes or heterozygotes, flag allele carriers
of certain alleles, count the number of a specific allele carried by an
individual, extract one or both alleles, estimate and generate confidence
intervals for measures of single-marker disequlibrium, and test for
departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

The package description file and a simple example are appended below.
Comments and contributions are, of course, welcome.

Subject: [R] Leaving out graduations and numbers on y axis plot
Message-ID: <20021127143834.GA13380@phil.chu.com.au>

Hi all,

I want to use a fourth plot on a page as a "map" of how to interpret 
the previous three plots - so the x axes are all the same but I want 
the y axis on the fourth plot to have no graduations or numbers - is 
this possible?

I had a look in Peter's book and the help stuff but couldn't see 
anything.

Thanks,

Phil.

The problem of Rterm.exe not quitting under ESS appears to me to be new to 
R 1.6.1. This doesn't seem to be a problem using John Fox's ESS setup. 
My  .emacs  prior to using John's setup had the line:

(setq-default inferior-R-program-name "c:/usr/local/R/bin/Rterm.exe")

Could this be a problem?

You can generally use the 'axes = FALSE' argument to the plotting
function to leave out both axis lines.  

If you only want to leave out one or the other use 'xaxt = "n"'  or
'yaxt = "n"' as an argument to the plotting function as appropriate.

Take a look at ?plot.default for information on the use of the 'axes'
argument or ?par for 'xaxt' and 'yaxt'.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Dear all:

I am another R-beginner in the state.

I have tried to analyze a large data (3,600 kb as csv format) set with R.
When I type lm(x~y), it says

Does any of you have any idea how can I solve this problem?
Sorry for bothering you during Holiday.

Thanks,

See ?NA on how to deal with NAs (specifically test on NAs [is.na()] and
assignment of NAs [as well is.na(), in principle]). Examples:
 is.na(x)
 is.na(x) <- TRUE

You can specify the NA character in read.table at once as in:
 read.table(my.file, na.string = -9)

The problem with that is we need to open an OX X Carbon application  
from the
terminal command line. If we just set the browser to Mozilla it opens  
the X11 version,
but you cannot open Mozilla.app without using the "open" command. Your
suggestion will work, I hope, as soon as the GTK Mozilla is upgraded to  
1.2
in fink, provided that also handles the Java well. For the time being  
the
little netscape script is a quiet and innocent hack. You can also call  
it
mozilla, of course, and then use options("browser").

Martin,

I am sure that this does not get said often enough, but I wanted to
offer a note of thanks for the improved performance of the e-mail
lists lately. For me at least, the recent changes have resulted in a
decrease in the delivery time on r-help from 1.5 to 2.0 hours down to
about 30 to 35 minutes.

Thanks for your continued efforts in improving this valuable forum!

Hi,

I desperately seek to find the version 2 of the Affy package for R as 
described in the Vignette "textual description of affy" by November 
12th 2002 and in the article "Exploration, Normalization and 
summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data" R.A 
Irizarry et al. Can someone please help me find out where to download 
this newest version of Affy for R?

Thank you!

Subject: [R] Generate a time series from a data frame
Message-ID: <3DE4FC83.5090808@netarx.com>

I imagine this is in the documentation somewhere but I haven't been able 
to find it.
I have a data frame (octets transmitted on a network interface, a sample 
is appended)
that I wish to convert into a time series.
The as.ts is close to what I want but not quite right.

e.g.
 > octets <- read.table( "sample/time-series/typical-octets-in.data", 
header = TRUE );
 > octet.series <- as.ts( octets )
 > plot( octet.series )
This produces three plots: one each for the three variables, timestamp, 
maximum, average.
Of course, there is no regular interval.

I would to have a conversion fuction that aggregates the
data frames tuples into samples in the time series.
Something like...

deltat = 120, aggregate = c("max","mean" ) );

Associate Professor in Biostatistics or Statistics
The Department of Mathematics is soliciting applications for the tenure
track position of Associate Professorship in BioStatistics or Applied
Statistics, beginning August 2003. Demonstrated prior experience in
multidisciplinary medical or health related funded research is required.

Expected to be an asset in interdisciplinary health research projects in

collaboration with the College of Health and Human SErvices and other
health-related programs. A Ph. D. in Biostatistics or Statistics is
required and demonstrated excellence in research and teaching. The
decision process will start early in 2003. Applicants should submit a
complete resume, a description of research interests, and at least three

letters of references to Search Committee, Department of Mathematics,
University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223. Contact Dr.

Alan Dow at adow at email.uncc.edu for further information.
AA/EOE Women and underrepresented minorities are urged to apply.

The Department of Mathematics, in cooperation with the College of Health

and Human Services, is seeking an Associate Professor of BioStatistics
or Applied Statistics. The successful applicant will be expected to be,
or soon become, a significant asset to interdisciplinary research
projects in multidisciplinary medical and health related areas. Those
with prior experience in such funded research will be given preference.


The Department of Mathematics is in the College of Arts and Science, has

over 45 faculty members and a successful Ph.D. program. There are seven
statisticians and six others working in probability and stochastic
processes. In statistics, much of the research thrust in both
theoretical and applied statistics in recent years has been in
statistical methodology motivated by scientific or practical problems.
The department's statistics group has a strong, accomplished record in
the areas of Bayesian analysis, design of experiments, nonparametric
statistics, reliability theory, and survival analysis. The statistics
group's work in these areas is particularly characterized by its robust,

interdisciplinary applicability.


The College of Health and Human Services includes the departments of
Health Behavior and Administration, Kinesiology, and Social Work, and
the School of Nursing. Master's degrees are offered in four departments.

The College currently has over $2 million in externally funded projects,

including seven federally funded projects. Forty-five percent of
proposals submitted by faculty were funded last year. Faculty members
conduct research in a wide variety of health areas including nutrition,
gerontology, end of life issues, heart disease, quality of life,
self-efficacy, and cancer.

Perhaps you can start posting your problem in this list with a more detailed
explanation of the R's version you have, platform you use, and very
important in the e-mail subject.

Regarding the memory, its limit has been extended in the 1.6.0/1.6.1
versions.

Also, perhaps betwen putting your data in a data.frame (I presume) and the
moment you generate your linear model, you have variables that are using
momory space unnecessary, try to remove them.

Finally, rather than using the entire data set, you can start doing some
exploratory analysis with a sample of your population.
Check sample() for that.

Regards,
Carlos.

Dear all:

I am another R-beginner in the state.

I have tried to analyze a large data (3,600 kb as csv format) set with R.
When I type lm(x~y), it says

> ====
> Error: cannot allocate vector of size 1017272 kb.
> In addition: Warning message:

> NULL
> Error: cannot allocate vector of size 1017272kb.

Does any of you have any idea how can I solve this problem?
Sorry for bothering you during Holiday.

Thanks,

Chris

The basic issue lies in these routines from the start of arithmetic.c:


static double R_ValueOfNA(void)
{
    ieee_double x;
    x.word[hw] = 0x7ff00000;
    x.word[lw] = 1954;
    return x.value;
}

int R_IsNA(double x)
{
    if (isnan(x)) {
        ieee_double y;
        y.value = x;
        return (y.word[lw] == 1954);
    }
    return 0;
}

(Notice that the system isnan() function/macro is used in the second routine)

I believe that the IEEE standard prescribes that *anything* with 0x7ff
in the exponent field of a floating point number is a NaN, and that
arithmetic on a NaN gives a NaN result. R's NA value is merely a
special NaN with the 1954 code in the low word. 

Now, it is certainly possible to get the byte-order wrong for a given
architecture, but then our NA wouldn't be a NaN, and the is.na(NA)
test should fail, but it doesn't. So it seems that NA really is a NaN
value on the Zaurus, but arithmetic on it gives a non-NA result, which
sort of indicates that the Z. is not treating all NaN's equally,
possibly only applying IEEE rules to NaN's that are like the ones
generated invalid calculations. It might be instructive to see what
the bit pattern of 0./0. is on this machine.

Subject: [R] Contrast problem
Message-ID: <1038421254015650@lycos-europe.com>

Hi,

I have a question regarding contrasts in linear models. I have a factor variable 
age with 4 levels, in the output of the linear model I want a coefficient for each 
level of age.

I have made sure that age is a factor but am unsure how to put age into the 
model to ensure the model knows it is a factor an dto display all levels.

I have tried doing

fit<-lm(y~C(age)+sex.....) (the dot bits are the rest of the function which I have 
cut out as its not important here)

but it only displays age as though it has one level

what am I doing wrong and how can I get R to recognise its a factor?

Thanks
Jane

But what you set could be "open -a Mozilla": it does not have to be
`Mozilla'.  I assume that if `open' works from a shell in your example it
will equally work from the shell called by R to invoke the browser.

Dear list

I have a very simple question which is causing me problems!

I have a matrix A and simply want to rbind this matrix together n times (n is a large number)
How can I write this in R?
I know I could do new<-rbind(z,z,z,...z) with z written n times but this will take forever as n is so large.

Is there a simple way to write this?

Cheers

Subject: [R] Error message: missing value where logical needed

  I think you need something more like

MXPLOCO[is.na(MXPLOCO[i]) | MXPLOCI[i] == -9] <- NA

which will be faster (since it's vectorized rather than using a for loop) 
as well as not giving you an error.  The basic problem is that x==NA gives 
NA instead of TRUE or FALSE (since *any* operation with an NA gets 
"tainted" by the missingness of that datum).  is.na() is the way to go.
You could also look at the na.strings argument of read.table().

I think you are getting bitten by the fact that the locations for
drawing points and lines can be specified in a number of different
coordinate systems.  There is a default coordinate system for each
graphical primitive;  for points the default is "native" which means
that points are drawn relative to the x-scale and y-scale of the current
viewport, but for lines the default is "npc" which means that lines are
drawn relative to a "normalised" coordinate system [bottom-left corner
of the viewport is (0,0), top-right corner is (1,1)].  The defaults are
there so that you can ignore the use of "units" to specify a coordinate
system in some cases, but if the default isn't what you want then you
will have to get your hands dirty :)  [Complaints about selection of
inappropriate default units should be directed to me :(]

I hope the following example (comments included) helps to show what is
going on ...

    library(grid)
    x <- rnorm(10)
    y <- rnorm(10)
    push.viewport(plotViewport(c(5, 5, 3, 2)))
    push.viewport(dataViewport(x, y))
    grid.rect(gp=gpar(lty="dashed"))
    grid.xaxis()
    grid.yaxis()
    # default units for grid.points are "native"
    grid.points(x, y)
    # can specify other units
    grid.points(c(0, 0, 1, 1),
                c(0, 1, 1, 0),
                default.units="npc",
                pch=16)
    # default units for grid.lines are "npc"
    grid.lines(c(0, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0),
               c(0.5, 1, 0.5, 0, 0.5),
               gp=gpar(col="green"))
    # can specify other units
    grid.lines(unit(x, "native"),
               unit(y, "native"))

?grid.points says:

Usage:

     grid.points(x = unit(runif(10), "native"),
                 y = unit(runif(10), "native"),
                 pch = 1, size = unit(1, "char"),

                                 ^^^^^^^^
                 gp=gpar(), draw = TRUE, vp = NULL)


?grid.lines says:

Usage:

     grid.lines(x = unit(c(0, 1), "npc", units.per.obs),
            y = unit(c(0, 1), "npc", units.per.obs), 
            default.units = "npc", units.per.obs = FALSE,
                            ^^^^^
            gp=gpar(), draw = TRUE, vp = NULL)

Nothing you have said seems to contradict this. If you want grid.lines to use 
the native coordinate system, use 'default.units = "native"'

One way is

  t(matrix( rep(t(z), n), nrow=ncol(z)))

There's probably a quicker way using aperm(), as well.

An easy way is to not use rbind, but to use row-indexing, e.g.:

 > x <- matrix(1:4, ncol=2)
 > x
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3

Subject: [R] read.table: colClasses when num. of columns is unknown
Message-ID: <AFD78192EC49D311BFAE00902798AB8F23DC05@jupiter.arbitrade.com>

Hi,

I am looking for a way to read tables that have general structure of

characterTag num1 num2 ...

i.e. one character column followed by an unknown to the caller (but fixed
throughout the file) number of numeric columns. I wanted to improve the
speed of read.table by using colClasses, but that seemed to require
knowledge of the actual number of columns in the file. For example I tried
colClasses=c("character", rep("numeric", 100)), here 100 is an upper
boundary on the number of columns, and hoped read.table() would just ignore
the unused entries. But read.table failed and printed an error message
(proving once again that R is a production-strength software).
Is there any way around? Note that my files do have headers so the number of
columns should be known to read.table once it parses the header.

Thanks,
Vadim

Hi:

I am using R 1.5.1 on Windows, and the "Inversion" method for normal
generator doesn't exist in the "RNGkind" function.

I only see the following options inside the function:

c("Kinderman-Ramage", "Ahrens-Dieter", "Box-Muller",
        "user-supplied", "default")

Am I missing something?

Ravi.

Is z a matrix too?  A more efficient way would be

dn <- dim(z)
new <- t(matrix(t(z), dn[2], dn[1]*n))

relying on recycling.  As the t's show, it works most naturally for cbind.

I got this wired behaviour of the attr() function using R-1.6.1 on both 
linux redhat 7.3 (i386) and Solaris 8 (Sparc):

The attr()function doesn't find the 'n' attribute, however, if I don't 
create the 'n.ch' attribute, it finds it!  That is:

NULL

Dear Mick,

If efficiency isn't an issue, you could do

B <- A
for (i in 1:(n - 1)) B <- rbind(B, A)

A more efficient, but less transparent, approach would be

matrix(rep(t(A), n), nrow(A)*n, ncol(A), byrow=TRUE)

I hope that this helps,
   John

You can't get that, only 3 contrasts can exist for a 4-level factor.
By default you get second - first, third - first and fourth - first.

Is age really a factor (try is.factor)?

as.factor(age) will ensure that.

So read it yourself with readLines and push the header back.

An upgrade. The Inversion method was added in 1.6.0.

It's a bug in do_attr.  Although not documented, this looks for a partial
match as well as a full match.  *Unfortunately* if it finds two partial
matches (as in your example) it gives up and returns NULL.  That is
correct unless there is an exact match later ....

I am about to put a fix in R-patched.

Subject: [R] subscripting a column from a data frame: row.names are dropped
Message-ID: <AFD78192EC49D311BFAE00902798AB8F23DC06@jupiter.arbitrade.com>

Hi,

When a single column is subscripted from a data frame it doesn't inherit the
row names of the data frame. I find it surprising given the extent to which
R tries to carry names across computations. Is there a good reason for this?

Here is what I mean in details:

> y <- data.frame(a=c(1,2), b=c(1,2), row.names=c("x","y"))
y <- data.frame(a=c(1,2), b=c(1,2), row.names=c("x","y"))
> y
y
  a b
x 1 1
y 2 2
> y[,1]
y[,1]
[1] 1 2
> 

Note that y[,1] has no names. I use R1.6.0 if it matters.

Thanks,
Vadim

Dear Christine,

You can use square brackets, as in expression(x[i]). See ?plotmath for 
details and examples.

I hope that this helps,
  John

Take a look at ?plotmath

I believe you will find that 'x[i]' will yield x subscript i.

Curiously enough

open the index.html file in $R_HOME/doc/html in the default browser
(which happens to be Chimera on my machine, which has broken Java
support on Jaguar). So it ignores the -a switch. Maybe something with  
shell
escapes (?). In the shell "open -a Mozilla foo.html" works fine.

Indeed, "open" will use the default browser defined in LaunchServices  
if asked
to open a foo.html file. If I set Mozilla as my default browser in  
System
Preferences, then even

 > options(browser="open")
 > help.start()

works fine. So this is another way to do it. But unfortunately I don't  
want
carbon Mozilla as my default OS X browser. It's ugly.

So for me the little netscape script hack is the simplest way to go.

It now does in R-devel (and also for while()).

It's in R-devel.tar.gz, in file src/library/base/R/windows/system.gnw.r

What do you mean by the `R-devel directory'?

Subject: [R] Running R away from windows (to Linux)
Message-ID: <sde6480d.095@dss2.med.gu.se>

I want to migrate my R workspace databases (e.g., .Rdata) from Windows to Linux.  The R help file for "save" says that "[a]ll R platforms use the XDR representation of binary objects in binary save-d files, and these are portable across all R platforms."

Is it is simple as that?  Copy the Windows .Rdata file to the Linux .ext3 file system?


Thanks,

You should do either something like

assign(paste("Lst", i, sep=""), value)

or rather use a list of the lists:

Lst <- vector("list", 3000)
Lst[i] <- value

Perhaps it helps.

Message-ID: <1038497980.3de638bc0ffb1@webmail.sapo.pt>

Hello!

I need to classify a data set with 19 variables and 9 classes 
using Logistic Regression(on R).
I know that when we have only 2 classes we can use glm() to 
estimate the coefficients of the model. But I don?t understand 
how can I do a classification task with Logistic Regression on 
a data set with 9 classes! 
Does anybody know how can I estimate these coefficients (of a 
model with 9 classes) on R?

Thank you!

Yes. That's how it is supposed to work.

You can't do `logistic regression' as usually defined with
more than two classes.  You can do multinomial logistic regression,
sometimes known as multiple logistic regression: use function multinom() in
package nnet (part of the VR bundle), most easily.

Subject: [R] big model on modest computer.
Message-ID: <200211281559.16199.chrysopa@insecta.ufv.br>

Hi,
I have a pentium III 600 with 128 ram running Linux.

I have a dataset with this variables in 12000 lines.

coleta = response (count data)
data = continuous data
latitude = continuous data
longitude = continuous data
variedade = categorical with 14 levels
solo = categorical with 22 levels
idade = continuous data
app = categorical with 4 levels

I want to test several models beginning by the full model.

coleta~data*latitude*longitude*variedade*solo*idade*app

Is possible to run this model in my computer? I try this and fail. Memory 
problem.

Thanks
Ronaldo

Subject: [R] looking for help on repeated measure ANOVA
Message-ID: <a05200f10ba0c1f50f419@[130.120.104.141]>

I am new to R, therefore this might be a naive question, sorry in 
advance for that.

I have data on 4 groups of mice (#of subjects: 8,8,8,9) where the 
first group is the control group and 2-4 are 3 doses of a 
neuro-inhibitor. For each mouse we measured the exploration time of a 
familiar and a new object (thus repeated measure design), and I want 
to test whether there are different exploration times between 
'familiar' and 'new' and whether drug treatment has an effect on 
exploration plus the combined effect. Checking out the mailing list 
archives I found the helpful page by J. Baron on R in psychology and 
tried to adapt his example in chapter 6. Below you can find the 
result, and I simply wanted to ask some more experienced statistitian 
than me if I did the right thing with these data.

Thanks in advance, Christian.

glm.nb is part of MASS, although you give no credit.  If you read the book
which this software supports you will find worked examples.

Read ?anova.negbin (more) carefully: it does explain this.

Only one entry is labelled as a `deviance', so just read more carefully.

Twice the log-likelihood, of course.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion on rnorm(), both
online and off.  I learned a lot.  Several people pointed out that the
issue was reported in bug report #1664 and indeed it was.  Also, the
problem goes away with RNGkind(, "Inversion").

However, I regard trying to break a random number generator as
precisely the best way to understand random variables and hypothesis
testing (does anyone else agree? Has anyone else tried to break
rnorm() with or without success? can people post their attempts?)

The original script was

>f <- function(n){max(rnorm(n))}
> plot(sapply(rep(5000,4000),f))   #[this takes my PC about 30 seconds]

Received wisdom is that "The Marsaglia-Multicarry and Kinderman-Ramage
options don't play nicely together in the extreme tails of the Normal
distribution" (PD) but I discovered last night that

> f.uppertail <- function(n,upper=3){x <- rnorm(n);x[x>upper]}
> plot(f.uppertail(1e7))

shows the effect much more directly...and viewed this way, the default
RNG would seem to be more seriously flawed.  The second script above
considers the upper (ie Z>3) tail of the Gaussian: and it has gaps.
This is borderline "extreme tails" because pnorm(3) is only about
0.998.

In contrast, Bug #1664 refers to the maximal value of a series of
rnorm() values which, as PBR points out, _is_ a rather severe test of
any RNG; the difference between f.uppertail() and #1664 would be that
#1664 simulates

> dmaxnorm <- function(x,n){n* dnorm(x)*pnorm(x)^(n-1)}

which involves PDFs and CDFs; f.uppertail() is solely a rnorm() issue.
If nothing else, f.uppertail() is a simpler test for rnorm().

many thanks again to the List--it Rocks

You know so?  My calculations made this a 1.9Gb design matrix with more
columns than rows, so

(a) my guess is that you will hit the 4Gb/process address limit in i686
Linux and

(b) it won't `work' in any statistically meaningful way. That model fits
all products of 0 to 4 continuous variables in each cell of a 22*14*4
(from memory) contingency table.

I think it is the statistical strategy that needs to be thought through.

Actually, it's not all that different, and it is much easier to see if
you think in terms of non-exceedance probabilities:

  P(max X < x) = P(X < x)^n

so taking max just rescales the p axis on a plot of the CDF by taking
p^n, which will naturally emphasize the upper tail. However if the
distribution of X has a gap at x so will the distribution of the
maximum.

It *is* a bit uncomfortable. Probably someone ought to go in and
investigate exactly what the nature of the interaction between the two
methods amounts to, and maybe we should consider changing the default
eventually (although as Brian said there are back-compatibility issues
that make this rather less attractive).

I think you have to hack filled.contour slightly to get what you want. 
It's not a major hack;  I've attached a hacked filled.contour -- look
for the comment ## HACK -- which together with the slight modification
of your example below gives what I think you are looking for ...

    junk.mat <- matrix(rnorm(12800), 128, 100)
    xYears <- 0:(nrow(junk.mat)-1)
    yPeriod <- 1:ncol(junk.mat)
    temp <- seq(10, ncol(junk.mat), 10)
    myLabels <- 2^(temp/10)
    cwtquants <- quantile(junk.mat,
                          probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 1))
    quant2plot <- c(cwtquants[1], cwtquants[2],
                    cwtquants[3], cwtquants[4],
    cwtquants[5], cwtquants[6])
    # Need hacked filled.contour (in attached file)
    source("myfilled.contour.R")
    filled.contour(xYears, 
                   yPeriod,
                   junk.mat,
                   levels = quant2plot,
                   col=rainbow(5),
                   plot.axes = {axis(1); 
                                axis(2, temp,
                                     labels = myLabels[10:1]) },
                   plot.title =
                     title(main = "Continuous Wavelet Transform",
                           xlab = "Time(Years)",
                           ylab = "Log(Period)"),

Subject: [R] KS for goodness of fit
Message-ID: <sde72f7e.026@wisemail.weizmann.ac.il>

Dear All,
I have two distributions which I don't their nature. I want to check whether they come from the same distribution. I know that I can use KS test however the standart function ks.test applies only the ks test for testing the difference of two samples (non-parametric). By the way the distribution are of Euclidean distances. One of observed and the other of shuffled data.
Thanks,
Ron

Use ifelse:

TREUE <- ifelse((TREUE == 11) & (EMPFEHL < 11), EMPFEHL, TREUE)

Note: & is the vectorizing 'AND'.

Message-ID: <3DE7430D.3030700@epm.net.co>


Hi, R users!
Suppose I make a model like this:

model1<-glm(resp~var1+var2+factor1+factor2+var1:factor1+var1:factor1+var2:factor2+var2:factor2,family=poisson) 


where "resp" is a response variable (poisson distributed)
"var1" and "var2" are continuous variables
and "factor1" and "factor2" are nominal variables (here I use them as 
dummy variable)
"factor1" has 2 levels (2 and 8)  and "factor2" 3 levels ( 1, 6 and 12).
Now I want to obtain the labels of the coeficients of the model in 3 
separate columns and a
4th column with the corresponding value,

like this:

variable1       variable2      level       value
(intercept)                                  X
var1                                         X
var2                                         X
factor1                            8         X
factor2                            6         X 
factor2                           12         X 
var1                factor1        8         X
var1                factor2        6         X 
var1                factor2       12         X
var2                factor1        8         X
var2                factor2        6         X
var2                factor2       12         X

If I use:
model1$coef, I obtain the name of the coef, but joined.
I want them separated.

Thank you very much for your help!!!

TREUE[ind] <- EMPFEHL[ind]

Have you read about indexing, if and ifelse, & and &&?

Neither if() nor "&&" works vectorized, use ifelse() and "&" instead
(see the help pages for details).

Perhaps you want to use strsplit on the character vector to separate the
names of the interaction terms?

use integers in square brackets to adress the position of your lhs-variable,
is this what you want?

That is not one string, it is a character *vector*.

But beware.  Fisher said that failure to achieve significance means you need to acquire more data.  How do you know that the test has adequate power in any given situation, or that a test of a NULL hypothesis is appropriate?

Dear Kenneth,

At 05:35 AM 11/29/2002 -0500, you wrote:


>If I use:

There may be a simpler -- and more transparent approach --  but if I 
understand correctly what you want, here's a start:

     predictors <- attr(terms(model), "variables")
     predictors <- as.character(predictors[3:length(predictors)])
     levels <- lapply(predictors, function(x) levels(eval(parse(text=x))))

Then predictors holds the predictor names and the list levels holds factor 
levels (or NULL for a numeric predictor). Now you need to consider the 
contrast coding for each factor to figure out how to use the levels:

     lapply(predictors, function(x) {
         x <- eval(parse(text=x))
         if (is.factor(x)) contrasts(x)
         })

and you also need to determine where the interactions are. The relevant 
information is in terms(model) and attr(model.matrix(model), "assign").

The programming from this point looks tricky to me but doable. An 
alternative would be to examine names(coef(model)) using some of the other 
information.

I hope that this helps,
John

A google search for "lrm R" quickly found the answer.  Also see http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/Design.html

Yes, but none of them is what he wants.

lrm is in Frank Harrell's `Design' package. You can also do logistic
regression with glm(), which is in the base package.

Subject: [R] Regular Expressionsionism
Message-ID: <sde7aef9.061@dss2.med.gu.se>

Isn't there a cryptic footnote somewhere in the blue book that describes regular expressions as "a funny little language ..." ?  Well, I'm not laughing!

I've googled and Man paged, but the GREP-style solution to the following problem still eludes me:

... Using a regular expression in the "pattern" argument to list.files() to restrict the return to filenames which
contain both "Elstim" and "post".  E.g.,

>list.files()
... 
[133] "J30710_Control_msa_amplitude_5_25_s1-30w.pre"                                                    
[134] "J30710_Elstim_msa_amplitude_5_25_s1-30w.post"

[137] "J30712_Control_msa_amplitude_5_25_s1-41_44-46_48w.pre"                                           
[138] "J30712_Elstim_msa_amplitude_5_25_s1-17_19-43_45_48w.post"                                        
                                       
I have not found the key to generating the logical AND equivalent of the "|" OR infix operator, a 
proxy for the simpleton's dream:  my.list.files(pattern="*Elstim" & "*post") 

Thanks

- Derek

P.S.,

Of course I could always do this in stages:

>  elstims <- list.files(pattern = "Elstim")  # all the files with "Elstim"
>  ElPostinos <- grep("post",elstims) # all the elstim files with "post"
>  my.file.list <- elstims[ElPostinos]  # result:  list of filenames 

But my conscience would bother me for taking the easy way out.

As long a you know the order, how about "Elstim.*post" ?

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.44.0211291225350.13491-100000@ptah.u.arizona.edu>

Hi -

I'm trying to build R 1.6.1 on a Powerbook running Macintosh 10.2.2 with
the most recent software update. The latest version of the developer tools
is installed. I have also installed g77 and f2c from fink (the binary
versions, using apt-get).

./configure fails with the following error:

> checking for dummy main to link with Fortran 77 libraries... unknown
> configure: error: linking to Fortran libraries from C fails

I also tried using ./configure F77=f2c, which gives this error:

> configure: WARNING: unknown Fortran 77 name-mangling scheme
> configure: error: cannot use Fortran

I know R can build on OS X --- what am I missing or doing wrong? Perhaps
my Fortran compilers are not the right versions? Would getting them using
"fink install" make a difference (as opposed to "apt-get install")?

Thanks,

Kieran

You have a mysterious ssh_z prepended to all the symbols.

Almost certainly you have a non-standard zlib.h/zconh.h in your include
path which is not matching your libz.{a,so}.  Install the real zlib 1.1.4
instead.

Make sure you have the OS X 10.2 version of fink. See their
Jaguar pages for instructions. Make sure

g77 -v
gcc -v

are both based on gcc version 3.1

Hi -

thanks, that was the problem. I had the  right version of fink, but the
apt-get binary packages may be out of date for 10.2.2. I compiled g77
from source (sudo fink install g77) and R compiled fine after that.

I have found that the useful R function 'gl' does not seem to be
present in S-Plus (version 6, 2001), though something similar can
be achieved with 'rep', present in both R and S.

Have I missed something?
Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Dear friends - using windows xp and R1.6.1
when doing
x <- 12
as.character(x)
[1] "12"
plot(1,2,pch=as.character(x))
the interesting point is marked with: 1 whereas I would like to see 12.
In par() is specified under pch:
Either an integer specifying a symbol or a single character to be used as 
the default in plotting points
How is that overridden ?

Best wishes

You want to mark a point with a character string `12'?  Use plot(type="n")
followed by text.

Subject: [R] About building R1.6.1 on Cygwin 
Message-ID: <008a01c29894$7d5f6220$118001db@webgis>

Hello.

 For building REmbeddedPostgres in Omegat
project(http://www.omegahat.org/RSPostgres/) requiring PostgresSQL's libs,
I've tried to build R1.6.1 on Cygwin following the instruction of
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/ since full-spec PostgresSQL running on
Windows can run only on Cygwin environment,

 However I've got following error messages.

 make -C front-ends Rpwd
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/R-1.6.1/src/gnuwin32/front-ends'

make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/R-1.6.1/src/gnuwin32/fixed'

 Could you tell me any suggestion of building  R1.6.1 on Cygwin?

 Best Regards.

You cannot. Instead, use text() to plot strings as in

 plot(..., type="n")
 text(..., as.character(x))

You are *not* following the instructions if you use the Cygwin version of
the compiler.  Those instructions are to build R for Windows (as they are
entitled), not R for Cygwin.

Building R undr Cygwin is not something you will find any instructions
for, to my knowledge.  Regard this as a new port and start with the main
sources and ./configure etc.  Expect to devote a week or more to it.

More seriously, REmbeddedPostgres uses libR.so which is part of the Unix
build of R.

There are omegahat mailing lists for omegahat components, I believe.

Then you don't have the Windows compiler ....

You need to treat it more like a Unix build than a Microsoft build
under Cygwin.  I made some progress last summer on it, basically
flagging it to be more like Linux, but it still didn't get all the way
(there are a few header files to patch, and then a show stopper bug to
figure out; this is about as much guidance as I can provide at this
point, but I recall guessing that it would take about a week to figure
out, time I didn't have).

best,
