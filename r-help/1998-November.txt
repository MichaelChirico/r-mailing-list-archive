Subject: [R] new platform (?) -- problems compiling
Message-ID: <199811020134.UAA12206@ln.nimh.nih.gov>

Hello, all.

I'm trying to get R working on linux-PPC (linux on a Macintosh, or, in my 
case, a Power Computing clone).

I'm using version 0.62.4, and I'm getting the following errors during 
compile in arithmetic.c:

44:  warning:  struct exception declared inside parameter list
45:  conflicting types for matherr
46:  dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
55:  dereferencing pointer to incomplete type

and then the "make" stops.

I haven't looked at arithmetic.c yet; I'm pretty new at this.

I also had the following messages from configure:

checking for main in -ldxml ...no
checking for main in -lblas ...no
checking for vfork.h        ...no
(but then it says there is a working vfork)
checking for dl.h           ...no
checking for ieefp.h        ...no
checking for ieee754.h      ...no
checking for dnet_ntoa in -ldnet ...no
checking for dnet_ntoa in -ldnet_stub ... no

I can certainly imagine that missing some of these things might cause the 
errors in compilation (although I'm not sure how).  If anyone can tell me 
what sorts of packages I might be missing and where I should look for 
them, or what changes to make to the code so I can compile, I'd 
appreciate it.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.3.96.981102225739.24582B-100000@ln.nimh.nih.gov>


R is having trouble finding some of the things it needs to compile.

In particular, I'm getting messages saying that it can't find things it
wants in -lblas, -ldxml, -ldnet, and -ldnet_stub.  It also can't find
dl.h, ieeefp.h, and ieee754.h.

I can't figure out whether these things are included with R somewhere and
I need to tell it where to look, or they're not included and I need to
get them.  I also can't figure out where I would set the -lblas, -ldxml
variables.  I've looked through make files and configure files.  I'm
stuck.

I'm doing this under linux-ppc on a Power Computer PowerWave.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
		Matt

Some of these things needn't be a problem. R is testing for whether
various things exist that it can use but may or may not need. These might
be present in multiple different forms. For example, the headers needed to
define IEEE-754 standard handling of Inf and NaN might be in ieee754.h or
in ieeefp.h. Even if they are in neither place R will still compile, it
just won't handle infinity as nicely.

The -lblas check looks to see if your machine has an optimised set of
linear algebra routines in libblas (some vendors provide these). If it
doesn't R can provide its own routines.

For comparison, the Debian Linux machine on which I happily compile and
run R doesn't have -ldxml, -lblas, dl.h, ieeefp.h, -ldnet or -ldnet_stub.
It does have ieee754.h

If you can't compile there is probably something else wrong. What happens
after configure, make?

Hey,


I'm trying to use the code from the book S-Poetry in R (almost
everything

AsciiToInt, to translate characters to ascii values (a better name
should be CharToAscii ?) I cannot find anything in R to do that,
getting
the ascii values? Is there something, or must it be added at the C
level?

Thanks,

That is rather well-documented: see help(.Random.seed).  It is the sum
modulo 1 of three rather poor multiplicative congruential generators.

I think exactly copying S (or S-PLUS: there are some differences)
would be subject to complaints of copyright infringement. 

> 3) Will there be an  l1fit  function in future releases

None is planned. You can use my rlm function (in library MASS;
better versions to come) to do this slowly: take k to be very small
in the Huber M-estimator. However, I see no statistical advantages
in the L1 regression over the alternatives already available for
R (under Unix, at least).

If you see a need for one, please write it and submit it. It will
need to be in compiled code to be useful, I think.

Until we can resolve the problems with dynamic loading, package
availability for Windows is going to be rather limited. (At present
it works on some systems but not others: in particular, not on mine.)

I'm not sure about this one.  One of those doing the Windows port will
probably reply.

It used to be SuperDuper (some years ago), but was replaced by a
version of Wichmann-Hill generator (Applied Statistics Algorithm AS183)
which claims a period of > 6.95 * 10^12.  By default, a random seed is
chosen using the system clock, but you can initialize the generator
with a particular seed using an expression like
	.Random.seed <- c(1000, 2000, 3000)
The manual entry obtained with ?Random has more details.
(It would be nice to offer users a choice, but what should the choices be?).

 > 3) Will there be an  l1fit  function in future releases

As with most R code, this depends on someone taking an interest and
providing the code.  There are a number of published algorithms for l1
fitting so it is just a matter of grabbing one of these and following
the way that "lm" builds the design matrix and does the fitting.

So has anyone tested how good the resulting generator is?

Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry generator is very easy to implement--he
has posted some C code to newsgroups--and seems to test out OK. I wonder
if it would make sense to use one of his generators instead.

I am reproducing Marsaglia's message to sci.stat.math below. (I am
not suggesting that this one should be the RNG in R. I am just
reproducing his message.) This RNG has been implemented into the
latest version of the Ox matrix programming language (along w/ two
other RNGs of different periods). I would tend to suggest to use

#define UNI (znew+wnew)*2.32830643708e-10

instead of what is used below. (This is the way that Ox implemented
it.)

Regards, FC.

----------------------- Marsaglia's message -----------------------------

I have often been asked to suggest random number generators
 for use in C.  Many good ones are available through the net,
 but they often require  complicated code and various
 ways to use or initialize through calls to subroutines.
 The following suggestion has these properties:
      Seems to pass all tests of randomness put to it.

      Has much much longer period, >2^60, than most
      system generators, <2^32,  and versions can be
      combined to get periods > 2^90, 2^120, etc.

      Exploits the feature of C that provides segments
      of in-line code through #define statements.  Thus
      random integers or reals can be put directly into
      expressions, avoiding the cost of calls to subroutines.

      Uses what I view as the most promising new method
      for random number generation: multiply-with-carry.

 Here is what you do: keep the following six lines of code
 somwhere in your files.

    #define znew  ((z=36969*(z&65535)+(z>>16))<<16)
    #define wnew  ((w=18000*(w&65535)+(w>>16))&65535)
    #define IUNI  (znew+wnew)
    #define UNI   (znew+wnew)*2.328306e-10
    static unsigned long z=362436069, w=521288629;
    void setseed(unsigned long i1,unsigned long i2){z=i1; w=i2;}

 Whenever you need random integers or random reals in your
 C program, just insert those six lines at (near?) the beginning
 of the program. In every expression where you want a random real
 in [0,1) use UNI, or use IUNI for a random 32-bit integer.
 No need to mess with ranf() or ranf(lastI), etc, with their
 requisite overheads.  Choices for replacing the two multipliers
 36969 and 18000 are given below.  Thus you can tailor your own
 in-line multiply-with-carry random number generator.

 This section is expressed as a C comment, in case you want to
 keep it filed with your essential six lines:
    /* Use of IUNI in an expression will produce a 32-bit unsigned
     random integer, while UNI will produce a random real in [0,1).
     The static variables z and w can be reassigned to i1 and i2
     by setseed(i1,i2);
    You may replace the two constants 36969 and 18000 by any
    pair of distinct constants from this list:
    18000 18030 18273 18513 18879 19074 19098 19164 19215 19584

    and k*2^15-1 are prime)*/

 I don't program in C, so the above comes from looking in manuals,
 (the mathematics, of course, is my own and I am pretty sure of it,
 and pretty sure of the randomness through my Diehard battery,
 available in

 I welcome suggestions if I have misinterpreted C conventions or

  You can use proc.time() and system.time(...) (look to the help).
  However, you will get only the elapsed time (the other entries
  are setted to NA).

Following up on the RNG discussions, I suggest the (GPL'ed) C code for the
'Mersenne Twister'. This RNG has a couple of quite impressibe features, see
the quote below. The quote is from a second implementation by Shawn Cokus
which adds even more speed. The code is available via the quoted URL. The
algorithm was published in one of the ACM journals early this year.

// This is the ``Mersenne Twister'' random number generator MT19937, which
// generates pseudorandom integers uniformly distributed in 0..(2^32 - 1)
// starting from any odd seed in 0..(2^32 - 1).  This version is a recode
// by Shawn Cokus (Cokus at math.washington.edu) on March 8, 1998 of a version by
// Takuji Nishimura (who had suggestions from Topher Cooper and Marc Rieffel in
// July-August 1997).

[...]

// According to the URL <http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html>
// (and paraphrasing a bit in places), the Mersenne Twister is ``designed
// with consideration of the flaws of various existing generators,'' has
// a period of 2^19937 - 1, gives a sequence that is 623-dimensionally
// equidistributed, and ``has passed many stringent tests, including the
// die-hard test of G. Marsaglia and the load test of P. Hellekalek and
// S. Wegenkittl.''  It is efficient in memory usage (typically using 2506
// to 5012 bytes of static data, depending on data type sizes, and the code
// is quite short as well).  It generates random numbers in batches of 624
// at a time, so the caching and pipelining of modern systems is exploited.
// It is also divide- and mod-free.

I'm not sure if I understand correctly what you mean by `histograms of
profiles' but I guess you mean profiles of cluster centers ... sorry
if there's a misunderstanding.

If m is a matrix containing the cluster centers, e.g., as returned by
kmeans from data x:

	k1 <- kmeans(x, centers=6)
	m <- k1$centers

you can try

	barplot(m, beside=TRUE)

or

	barplot(m, beside=FALSE)

depending on if you want the bars to be stacked or not

Best,
Fritz

Message-ID: <Pine.A41.3.96.981105140102.17958A-100000@kilauea.tvs.slu.se>

Hello,

I have compiled 0.62.4 under Linux and it runs fine (a gcc/g77
combination).  When I try the same thing under AIX (4.1.5) or under dec's
OSF (both also gcc/g77) I get problems.  Under AIX, system.c complains:

system.c: In function `waitForActivity':
system.c:150: `fd_set' undeclared (first use in this function)
system.c:150: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
system.c:150: for each function it appears in.)
system.c:150: parse error before `readMask'
system.c:154: `readMask' undeclared (first use in this function)

On the Alpha it compiles OK, but dumps core during initialization (I may
not have g77 installed right becuase I still get errors with g77 -v).

Has anyone experience with these two operating systems?  I access R on my
Toshiba libretto running linux with the display set to my 'other'
workstation, but I think it should run on at least one of these other
machines.

Hehe. That's a rather nice "David-and-Goliath" image. The Libretto is
215x125x25 mm, right?

Seriously, though: people have previously gotten around the Alpha/OSF
problems. Something about getting the ieee setting right - look through
the back archives of R-devel and R-help (better you than me....).

I don't recall anyone having pains with AIX before, but obviously
you're missing the definition of fd_set, which generally happens in
<sys/select.h>. I'd go searching in the include files for it.
something like

find /usr/include -name '*.h' | xargs grep fd_set

or 

find /usr/include -name '*.h' -exec grep fd_set {} /dev/null  \;

Subject: [R] R-0.62.4 for MSWindows 
Message-ID: <19981106092322.A31433@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

Following the release of R-0.62.4, I have update my Win32's port.

New features:
 - The console can be configured (font, colours, dimensions). 
  No fancy dialog (yet), but look to the rw0624/etc/Rconsole file.
 - help.start() now is implemented. Of course, you need the html 
  documentation.
    
Bugs fixed (I hope):
 - Alt+Gr problems on some European keyboards.
 - Focus is 'always' given back to the console.
 - Filters in the dialogs which ask a file-name.
 - round(..) now works as documented.
 - Some small modification to the graphic device (position of
   text and clipping of lines was sometimes not exact). In addition,
   I changed the font to helvetica (for better consistency
   with the X11 device).
	  
New Files:
 - rw0624b.zip : binary distribution (unzip somewhere; the
   executable is in rw624/bin); 
 - rw0624s.zip : source;
  - rw0624html.zip : documentation in html form; unzip inside rw0624;
		                   no name mangling -> don't use with Win3.1+Win32s.

Hi,

Just downloaded the R-0.62.4 of R and tried to install it. With the
standard procedure :

./configure
make

At the end of the compilation I got the following message :
ld:

I attach the printout after the ./configure and make commands.
Thanks for your help.

The Alt+Gr keys work OK now, but I've observed a strange side effect. After
using any of these keys, the Up and Down arrows don't scroll through the
command history, but simply scroll the contents of the console window on
line up or down.  Strange enough, pressing Ctrl-End restores the usual
command history scrolling.

I'm running NT4 with French keyboard.

By the way, I remember that one of the early Windows versions of S-PLUS
also had problems with the Alt+Gr keys.

Anyway, the program runs nicely and the console output is really fast.
Thanks Guido for excellent work!

You should use the following settings in your config.site file:

FC="f77"
FFLAGS="-g -fpe3"
SHLIBLDFLAGS='-shared -expect_unresolved "*"'
LDCMD="f77 -g -nofor_main -fpe3 "

Your problem (main: multiply defined) was caused by the missing
"-nofor_main" in LDCMD.

Splus 4.0 or later indicating it was modified and getting worse. 
I only have Splus 3.4 for HP. So I cannot try it. 
This makes the idea of using the

Umm. There are no reported changes and I have observed no differences
in the random numbers in later versions of S-PLUS (4.0, 4.5, 5.0).


Without the code for the bootstrap example quoted we cannot
investigate, but my guess is that the problem is elsewhere in R.
You can NOT conclude that the problem is in R's PRNG, only that it
is in R. So could you please post the full details to R-devel.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.91.981109082658.15531A-100000@oriole.er.usgs.gov>

Hello,

I've been migrating my computing to R and have not had any major
problems running old Splus programs in R.  However, the one thing
I am missing is the ability to attach directories full of general
utility functions from whereever I happen to fire up an R session.
As a consequence, I find myself making many duplicate copies of
these little general purpose functions by cutting and pasting 
Splus function code.  In any case, this capability would seem to be 
of fundamental importance and so I would guess that it can be done.
I figured I could do something like attach("/home/royle/.RData"),
but apparently not. Can someone help me with this?

Thanks and regards,
andy

Mai,

Someone forwarded to me your e-mail about RNGs.

I do not know about S-Plus 4.5, but S-Plus 4.0 RNG 
was bad.  It failed many of Marsaglia's DIEHARD tests.
S-Plus 4.0 documentation indicates that not the
Super-Duper, but a "modified" Super-Duper was used.
Modifying an RNG is not a good idea.  It tends to
make the RNG worse.  The original Super-Duper 
passes all the DIEHARD tests.

Regards,

Bruce

RNG in R and Splus 3.4

Prof. Ripley asked the details of the example. 
We were doing parametric bootstrap, so it is similar to simulation.
Anyway here is the details.

We start with a sample of 19 positive numbers. We know the sample
is from truncated exp(0.3)...only the truncation point, theta, is unknown.

In other words, the sample can be generated from something like

x1 <- rexp(100, rate=0.3)
x2 <- x1[x1<theta]     # the theta are big enough so that length(x2)>19
x3 <- x2[1:19]

And the true theta was 4, hidden from the students.
The estimate of theta from that particular sample was 3.87058501, 
the max of the sample.

Next we wanted to estimate the bias of the max, using bootstrap.
We did this:   

y1<-rexp(4000, rate=0.3)
y2<- y1[y1<3.87058501]
length(y2)  # to make sure y2 is longer than 1900 or whatever..so we are not
            # recycling 
y3<-y2[1:1900]               

# now y3 contains 100 bootstrap samples of 19 each

y4 <- matrix(y3, ncol=19, byrow=T) # actually some of students did
                                   # y4 <- t( matrix(y3, ncol=100) ) 
maxboot <- apply(y4, 1, max)
biasboot <- mean(maxboot) - 3.87058501

We did this for more than 100 runs, depend how much memory you have on your
machine, you can try put a few zeros to the above code. but you get the idea. 
The final result, biasboot, is very different when using R or Splus 3.4
Roughly 2 times (biasboot from R) = (biasboot from Splus 3.4) 
In this particula case the bias was 3.87058501-4. R seem to be better
than Splus which give a biasboot that is too small (or too big in abs value)
But more analysis using simulation reveals otherwise.

We then tried the simulation and that was reported earlier....

We use Rjune on the Win95 and Win NT machine.

I don't remember exactly the status in previous versions, but as of R 0.62.4
there is a "plot" method for objects returned by prcomp and princomp, and there
is also biplot and screeplot. These should all be available after you do
library("mva").

You might want to do this in the form of an R package. Check
help(library) for the details. Or you could just source() them in
~/.RProfile (except that that would duplicate them into all of your
.RData files...).

Thomas, Interesting, can you try the following too?

b <- function(x, nboot, theta) {

     y1<-rexp(2*length(x)*nboot, rate=0.3)
     y2<-y1[y1<theta]
     y3<-y2[1:(length(x)*nboot)]
     y4<- matrix(y3, ncol=length(x), byrow=T)
     mean(apply(y4, 1, max))- theta
}

I got arround -0.155 on Rjune.
Where x is a length 19 vector, theta=4
One typical run is

[1] -0.1585402 

While on Splus I got

It seems that the problem is in RJune (or somewhere in your installation).
We really need someone else to try this on RJune.

Subject: [R] Pivoting a data.frame
Message-ID: <36482E15.E59EA96F@ogs.co.uk>

Hi,
 
I would like tranform a data.frame which has a structure similar to the:
 
Col1    Col2    Col3
B1      1       0.3
B1      2       0.4
B1      3       0.3
B2      1       0.2
B2      2       0.2
B2      5       0.4
B2      6       0.1
B3      1       0.2
B3      2       0.1
B3      5       0.2
 
[Data Frame 1]
 
Into the following structure (pivoting or transpose is
being used sometimes to describe this, I believe).
  
        B1      B2      B3
1       0.3     0.2     0.2
2       0.4     0.2     0.1
3       0.3     NA      NA
5       NA      0.4     0.2
6       NA      0.1     NA
 
[Data Frame 22]
 
As you see above, the columns of Table 1 is rearrange to
categorise the third column (in terms of Col1 and Col2).
 
I wonder whether anybody here could help me to code this
in S-Plus or R, or point me on the direction how to do
this.
 
 
Many Thanks,
 
Athula.

Subject: [R] Debian GNU/Linux package of R-0.62.4
Message-ID: <6rpvavzd21.fsf@verdi.stat.wisc.edu>

I have created a Debian Linux package from R-0.62.4 and uploaded it to
the master Debian archive.  It will be incorporated in the 2.1 (or
"slink") release of Debian GNU/Linux.  This release is currently
frozen (i.e. bug-fixes only are allowed in uploads).  The scheduled
release date is December 15, 1998.  We'll see if we can actually make
the scheduled release date on this release :-).

The package is called r-base_0.62.4-1.  It can be installed on a
Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 system as it does not use any 2.1-specific
facilities.  It is currently available as
http://cran.stat.wisc.edu/bin/linux/debian/2.0/r-base_0.62.4-1_i386.deb
and should propagate to other CRAN sites within two days.

The source package is available at the usual Debian sites such as
      ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/slink/main/source/math/

P.S. If you wonder why the release is called "slink", the releases of
Debian GNU/Linux are named after characters in the movie "Toy Story".
The 2.2 release is named "potato" :-(.  I tried to get them to change
it to "potatoe" to inject some American political humor but they
refused.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.981111130303.407B-100000@pcinternet.biochem.dshs-koeln.de>

Hi everybody ...

I have to perform Hotteling's T^2 Test - more generally a MANOVA - on a
set of data.  Is there a (simple?) possibility to do it in R? 


The somewhat obvious way to do it would be

> summary(aov(Y ~ x1 + x2 ... + xn)) 

where Y would be a two-column matrix. 


But this does not work in any possible combination of matrix or factor
dimensions! Is it principally not possible to perform modelling of
multivariate data using the "~"-operator? 

I'm using R 0.62.2 on Linux 2.0.25. 

Many thanks in advance ...

Let's put it this way: It isn't, but it should be...

0.63 will contain some of the pieces, but not all. There's an extended
aov() and objects of class "maov", and in general you can use
matrix-responses. However, all you get from summary and friends are
lists of univariate results. Splus has manova(), which is essentially
just a wrapper for aov() which attaches class "manova" to the result,
but also summary.manova() computing the relevant test statistics. R
doesn't have this yet.

Probably the most practical way to proceed is to calculate generalised
sums of squares and products with 

> r<-resid(lm(y~x))
> t(r)%*%r

and then put TW Anderson's book in your lap and calculate Wilk's
lambda and asymptotic approximations of it's distibution. (Hotelling's
T^2 is some trivial transformation of W's lambda and can be converted
to an exact F distributed variable)

This seems reasonable with

	function

is a reserved word.

The following is (de-latexified) from "R-devel/doc/manual/primitive-funs.tex"
((which you will see as one of the first appendices in
  RHOME/doc/manual/Man.dvi   after "make dvi" 
  in R 0.63 (to be released soon)

  At the best of my knowledge, wavetresh hasn't be ported to R.
  I don't know it so I don't know how much work is required
  to made wavetresh working with R.
  If you have time, and if the package is really under a license
  that let this, I would suggest to try to pack wavetresh 
  as a R package WORKING UNDER LINUX (or some other fashion of Unix).
  Look to the R-Faq and to some of the module available in CRAN
  for what is needed (for a `polite' S module this can be as
  easy as (1) re-structuring the directories in the way R expects them;
  (2) converting (automagically) the documentation; (3) make some
  moderate make-up to the Makefile).
  Then, I would like to help you with the MsWindows part.
  
  I forward this message to r-help hoping that someone
  can give you some more advice.

I have made wavethresh working for R R 0.50 and it is in CRAN. I'm using
wavethresh under R 0.62 without any problems - essentially, the R 0.50
version needs a different directory structure, I think.

that would make SuSE way ahead of time as 0.63 is going to be released
today :-)

Not likely, since 0.6*3*.0 is being released today....

I don't recall anyone doing SuSE packages. Would be out of date for
the above reason anyway...

R should be very easy to compile from scatch on most Linux systems,
though. (I seem to recall a caveat with SuSE and the readline library,
but someone here can probably help you out)

Hi,
I try to use R for a beginners course in statistics. We use windows 
NT version 4. When I try to start R the message window "R Memory" 
with the message "memory problem" appears and R quits. This doesnT 
happen if you are logged in as administratot. Does annyone knows why 
and what I can do?

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Fri Nov 13 18:39:07 1998
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 13 Nov 1998 18:39:07 +0100
Subject: [R] R-0.63 is released
Message-ID: <x2k90ztrus.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've put up R-0.63.0.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.63.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63

NEW FEATURES

    o	library(... , warn.conflicts = TRUE)
	now prints all conflicts arising from attaching the given package.

    o	new  .Platform	variable  for better modularizing
	platform dependence. __This_is_"beta"_and_bound_to_be_changed___

    o	new arguments to colnames(..) and 
	rownames(x, do.NULL = TRUE, prefix = "row").
			   _
    o	par(bty = "]") for _| box(.) in plots.

    o	New standard package `modreg' (smoothing and local MODern
	REGression methods) contributed by B. D. Ripley.

    o	par() has a `no.readonly = FALSE' argument which allows more
	sensible  op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE);  on.exit(par(op)).

    o	Real Bessel functions of 1st to 3rd kind, of arbitrary order:
	besselI(), besselK(), besselJ(), besselY() are the I(), K(),
	J(), and Y() Bessel functions.

    o	New conflicts() function from B.D.Ripley

    o	uniroot has a new `maxiter' argument and returns #{iter} and
	precision.

    o	New option `show.coef.Pvalue' (default: TRUE).	If FALSE,
	print.summary.[g]lm does not print P values.

    o	New `R --vanilla' is equivalent to
	  R --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-init-file

    o	gc() has now a `verbose' argument and returns a matrix with free
	and total n- and v-cells(heap).

    o	New example(<foo>) function runs the \emph{Examples} R code of
	<foo>.	example() calls source() which now has a `verbose'
	instead of `debug' argument.

    o	experimental functions [as.|is.|]pairlist() for the few old-style
	dotted pair lists [undocumented].

    o	options(check.bounds = TRUE) makes sub-assignments which
	"stretch" a vector give a warning [dropped undocumented
	check.bounds() function].

    o	Makefiles should now conform (mostly) with the GNU Coding
	Standards.  In particular, `make install', `make uninstall'
	and `make install-strip' now work.
	Also, it is now possible to build R in a non-source directory.

    o	which() preserves names and has a new `arr.ind' argument
	allowing for array indices.

    o	New functions {d,p,q,r}signrank for the Wilcoxon signed rank
	distribution, and {d,p,q,r}wilcox for the Wilcoxon (rank sum)
	distribution.

    o	Command line options GNUified a bit further.
	New command line option `--verbose' for printing more
	information about progress.
	Command line options `--vsize' and `--hsize' as replacements
	for `-v' and `-n' which are now deprecated.
	Added `--silent' as synonym for `--quiet'.
	Short-style option `-V' obsolete.

    o	Added bug.report() to generate & send bug reports from
	within R.

    o	The PostScript device driver now uses the ISO Latin1 font
	encoding.  This should allow Western Europeans to render
	their languages correctly.  It is likely that additional
	encodings will be added (e.g. Latin2) when we figure out
	how to set the correct font encoding in printers.

    o	The mathematical annotation code has been reworked.  Italic
	correction works better.  Additional functionality will be
	added.

    o	"sample" now has an optional "prob" argument which gives the
	probabilities of sampling each element in the vector being
	sampled.  The present implementation is based on some code
	from E. S. Venkatraman <venkat at biosta.mskcc.org>.

    o	The internal data structure used to represent lists has
	changed from being based on dotted pairs to generic vectors.
	Users should see no changes as a result (with the exception
	of some efficiency gains in list operations).

    o	Subscripting matches that of S more closely.  It is now
	possible to use subscripting beyond that the end of vectors
	and lists.

    o	Element labelling in "c" and "unlist" should match that of
	of S.

    o	Added split.screen etc functions for manipulating multiple
	screens on a single device

    o	After help.start() the HTML help system is used for all help()
	requests. The name of the browser is now controlled by
	options("browser").

    o	Added kmeans to package mva (donated by B. Ripley)

    o	New persp function added.  It is NOT compatible with S (yet)
	and is subject to internal and interface changes.

    o	gctorture() for torturing the garbage collector to reveal
	memory protection bugs. (Call GC on every memory allocation). 

    o	B. Ripley's aov code (and more) has been added. This includes: 

	- aov() now handles models with Error terms, multiple
	  responses. 

	- proj(), model.tables(), se.contrast(), replications(),
	  eff.aovlist() are implemented for aov fits, and where
	  appropriate for lm fits.

	- dummy.coef(), with methods for lm and aovlist fits.

	- add1(), drop1(), step() for stepwise fitting of statistical
	  models, with default, lm and glm methods.

	- summary() and deviance() -- mlm methods.

	- kappa()  for estimating condition numbers) 

	- labels() to find a suitable set of labels from an object

	- C() for setting the contrasts of a factor

	- anova(), plot(), summary() and deviance() methods for mlm fits

    o	eval() semantics changed when envir= is a list. A 3rd argument is 
	now allowed, specifying the enclosure (i.e. where R looks for
	variables *not* found in envir=) it defaults to the calling 
	environment (was .GlobalEnv). Note that when used inside a function,
	it is often desirable to set the enclosure to the parent 
	environment instead. [ eval(e, data, sys.frame(sys.parent())) ] 


BUG FIXES

    o	min(NULL); max(double())  now give warnings.  range() gives NA.

    o	substring("", NULL) no longer segfaults.

    o	formatC(.) now takes default "width = 1" when both width and digits
	are unspecified.

    o	several fixes in internal axis and tickmarks setup for
	"extreme" ranges and values, especially for "log" scaling.

    o	seq(a,a, by=b) now works properly.

    o	print.data.frame(.) now calls print.matrix instead of print(.)
	which finally enables the 'right = TRUE' argument.

    o	R --help  gives more

    o	postscript() now uses 'hyphen' instead of 'plusminus' for a minus.

    o	source(..., echo=TRUE) now puts a `"' if necessary after truncation.

    o	Changes to the PostScript device driver mean that the volume
	of output has been reduced to about a third of what it was.

    o	Fixes and restructuring to name generation in connection with
	unlist() and c().

    o	Many bugs found and fixed in the memory allocation / garbage
	collection area. In particular, the parser was sometimes
	UNPROTECT()ing the wrong pointers.

    o	lm(y[g=="1"]~x[g=="1"]) caused memory corruption

Not yet. You can find 0.62.3 packages at my site under

  http://www-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/RPMS/uni-klu-suse/

But if you can wait some days, you'll find soon 0.64 there.

Subject: [R] seq() in 0.62.4 and 0.63
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.96.981114073433.27602B-100000@localhost>


Solaris 2.6, R Version 0.63.0  (November 14, 1998)
               Version 0.62.4  (October 24, 1998)

> seq(0.15, 0.70, 0.05)
 [1] 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65

The much reviled (on r-help) 0.62.3 got such simple cases right (even if
0.62.1 did not). 

Jim Lindsey insisted that such bugs are reported here, so I am.  And yes,
this is a real example and leads to an incorrect analysis of the dataset in
question. 

The problem is the lines

                            if (by > 0) 
                                    while (from + n * by > to) n <- n - 1
                            else while (from + n * by < to) n <- n - 1

One should try to avoid exact comparisons on floating-point quantities.
Given the work above to choose a suitable tolerance, we can attach a
tolerance here, say

      if (by > 0)  while (from + n * (1 - eps) * by > to) n <- n - 1
      else         while (from + n * (1 - eps) * by < to) n <- n - 1   

although I suspect eps is actually rather too small for safety (I would
suggest 10 x machine precision to allow for a number of lfoating point
operations).

However, I think there is a much simpler approach:

	    n <- as.integer(n + 0.1) # make sure n is not too small
            tol <- abs(to - from) * 10 * .Machine$double.eps
	    if(by > 0)	while(from + n*by > to + tol) n <- n - 1
	    else	while(from + n*by < to - tol) n <- n - 1

Argh!!!! We've been discussing alternative ways of getting seq right,

The : operator already uses 1e-7... (just like S does)

I've been advocating by*(from/by):(to/by), so as to have the fuzz-fix
in one place, and:

Of course one needs to get the sign things right as well...

I have tried to install R-0.63 on RedHat Linux 5.2, both Sparc and i386.
'./configure' and 'make' seem to go well, but 'make install' ends with:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/R-0.63/etc'
Installing executables ...
/usr/bin/install: bin/R.binary: No such file or directory
make: *** [install] Error 1

and, indeed, I cannot find  R.binary  anywhere. Any suggestion?
Installing earlier versions of  R  worked fine.

Kjetil Halvorsen mentioned a book call "S-Poetry in R". I checked with
amazon.com and Barnes and Noble but they don't have it listed. Can somebody
please give me the complete reference and where it can be obtained. 

Suggestion: Might it be possible to put a list of the most important and
new literature about R, S, and S+ which has a direct bearing on R in the
Documentation section of CRAN along with where they can be obtained? This
would be of great help to isolated neophytes beginning to use R.

I am replying to my own question (and adding some new questions):

After some debugging, I found that $(LDCMD) is set to 'fort77' (by
configure?). This is obviously wrong, and I get an error for the
command

fort77 -export-dynamic -o ../../bin/R.binary  etc.

saying that -export-dynamic is an illegal option. But  'make' continues.
This raises a few questions:

1. Why do 'we' want to link with  fort77?

1'. How do I most easily change the environment so that configure chooses
    the correct linker (gcc?)?

2. Why doesn't  'make' end with a fatal error, when it doesn't succeed
   to build  R.binary? This must be fatal, if anything? At least, one
   should be told in some way that something is wrong, I think. Note that
   R  compiles so fast that it is difficult to read the output on the
   screen. On my i386/450.

3. Can I  'make' with additional flags/options on, like -Wall, without
   editing all Makefiles?

Yes. SuSe seems to install an old version of readline, so all you have
to do is to compile and install a newer version of it.

He is confusing you. S-poetry is not a book, it is an on-line manuscript
of a declined book proposal (I am told by a publisher), available at

http://www.seanet.com/~pburns/Spoetry
http://www.i-way.co.uk/~pat/Spoetry

in PDF last time I looked. It is about S-PLUS, written by a former
MathSoft employee.

I am going to stick my neck out and say you need a good book on S-PLUS, say

Venables, W.N. & Ripley, B.D. (1997) Modern Applied Statistics with
S-PLUS. Second Edition. Springer.

and then read both of

R's FAQ

The `R' complements to V&R2, available from a mirror near you via
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS/sites.html.  (A new version updated
for 0.63 will be available by Monday, together with a new release
of R versions of the libraries and scripts.)

to understand some of the differences.

Many thanks to Markus Lang and Brian Ripley for helpful answers. I have
now 0.63 up and running, but my solution worries me a little:

On Sat, 14 Nov 1998, Goran Brostrom wrote:

As pointed out by Brian, this is probably _not_ wrong. 

The only fortran compiler available in RH5.2 seems to be fort77, and it is
apparently not a 'real' compiler, like g77. Does that matter?

> fort77 -export-dynamic -o ../../bin/R.binary  etc.
 
> saying that -export-dynamic is an illegal option. But  'make' continues.

I still think that  'make' should break here with a fatal error. This
happens when I try to  make  R-0.62.4. 

I 'solved' the problem with 'illegal option' by simply removing
'-export-dynamic' from the Makefile in src/main. After 'make clean;
make; make install' it seems to work; I can run R. But, will I encounter
problems in the future?

A question about make, btw: When I run make, and the target  R.binary  is
missing, shouldn't  make  try to build it? It doesn't.

Finally, I have to correct my statement that I had succeeded with making
earlier versions of  R. That's true, but not with RH5.2: I am running
R-0.62.4 on RH5.2, but it was built under RH5.1. This seems to indicate
that the upgrade RH5.1->RH5.2 is causing the problem. I still have
RH5.1 running at  home; I will check what happens there and eventually
come back with a report.

I have finally found the error about the fortran compiler, and it was 
all my mistake!

For some reason, g77 wasn't installed when I upgraded to 5.2, and when
I looked for an rpm named 'g77' or 'f77', I didn't find one. However,
it turns out that it is named 'egcs-g77', and after installing it
R-0.63 works just fine.

I agree -- I had a problem with compiling under Solaris (due to stupidly
telling R to look for the readline library in /usr/local/include rather
than /usr/local/lib).  Make proceeds happily and by the time I came back
to my computer the output from make docs had pushed the error out of my
xterm buffer so there was no sign of the problem.

This shouldn't be a problem. The flag tells the linker to export function
names for dynamic linking, but gcc on linux (which is what is hidden under
fort77) seems to do this by default. 

I think you can do this at the configure level by specifying
SHLIBLDFLAGS=
in config.site, to tell configure that you don't want it to magically
determine the right linking flags.

 yes and no. If you look at the R target in Makefile you will see that it
creates a file called stamp-R when R builds 'successfully'.  This, rather
than R.binary, governs whether the binary is rebuilt. The reason you have
a problem is that make didn't fail when it couldn't build R.binary *and*
you fixed the problem by changing only the Makefile, which isn't in the
dependency list for stamp-R.

The main problem here is the "linuxppc 2.1.128" bit...not too many
people have similar setups.

The first thing to do is figure out whether the problem is that
modreg.so isn't there or just isn't loadable.

Then, assuming that it *is* there, you'll have to see whether R has
gotten the procedure for creating dyn.load'able object files right on
your system. Probably the most handy thing is to go to the
demos/dynload directory and try making the example there. If it
doesn't work, I'm afraid your in for a bit of studying of the ld(1)
man page. 

Oh, BTW, *before* that, check whether configure finds the dlxxx
libraries needed for dynamic linking at all! If they're not installed,
well, you know what to do.

The following patch appears to work. At least it passes the following
test, which is more than can be said for the original:

# This takes a while...
max(sapply(rnorm(1000),
 function(x)max(seq(x+1/x,x+10000/x,1/x)-(x + (1:10000)/x))))

(gives 1.490116e-08, broken version gave several warnings about object
length mismatch)

I beg to differ (if both of you are referring to readline 2.2):

Using SuSE 5.3 'straight out of the box', without any changes or additions,
I have compiled succesfully both R-0.62.3 and R-0.63.0 (using gcc and f2c).
And everything seems to work without problems.

Though SuSE 5.3 contains readline 2.1 (packaged together with bash!)
configure and make run without complaining.

The only problem I have with SuSE is with f2c and then ONLY with
Jim Lindsey's library 'repeated' (probably because it contains Fortran90?)
The RedHat 5.1 f2c compiles 'repeated' without any problems.

One way is:

Sir,

this morning i recieved your message about the availability of the code
for Hotelling's Test. I hurried to find out whether the book you cited is
available at german universities/libraries. This seems not to be the case
yet. 

So the transmission of the code would be appreciated a lot. Many, many
thanks for your offer. 

Could i ask you for a little comment on Steve Selvin's publication? If
it's not available publicly in Germany within the next time, i probably
will try to get it via a bookstore at my own cost.

Regards,

To the Venables & Ripley reference I would add Phil Spector's
"Introduction to S and S-PLUS", which some people find a useful, more
dilute, preparation for V&R, and Chambers and Hastie, which is already
mentioned in the FAQ.

These are now at CRAN (at least in Vienna).

Please note that VR_5.3pl030-1.tar.gz really does need 0.63: there
are problems with 0.62.x and 0.63 reading .rda files written by the
other. The earlier VR_5.3pl027-1.tar.gz for 0.62.3/4 remains on CRAN
in directory Old/0.62.

tree_0.3-1 adds tree.screens and tile.tree (needs 0.63), and support
for formulae like  use ~ . - estperf - names.

Just grabbed the R-0.63.tar.gz from CRAN. Again during the build make
fails. bin/build-help did not have exec permissions. After that, it
failed for missing *.pl files called from build-help. I just copied
them from an R-devel I had. Then make docs worked. However, 
LibIndex was not built. I am on an hpux-pa1.1-hpux-10.20 using egcs:

gcc version egcs-2.92.18 19981101 (gcc2 ss-980609 experimental)

readline was configured and is working OK.

R_PAPERSIZE="letter" CPPFLAGS=" -I/home/xxxx/local/include " LIBS="
-L/home/xxxx/local/lib " ./configure --prefix=/home/xxxx/local
--with-f2c

Do I just built the LibIndex by hand, and fixed library/eda/R/eda so
that eda.sl is used instead of eda.so. This time I got 

> library(eda)
Error: dynamic library `eda.sl' not found

but when I do :

Osman,

This sounds strange. Not that we're beyond shipping things with files
missing, but I would expect something like that to affect all
platforms, not just HP-UX.  Are you sure you didn't unpack on top of
an old source tree or something like that? 

At any rate, we should probably see the make output, as well as any
possible anomalies from configure before we can do much to help.

The following used to work (0.62.1 the latest that I used), and now
it doesn't (0.63.0):


force <- vector(mode = "list", length = 1)
names(force)[1] <- somename

It returns the error:
Error in "[<-"(NULL, 1) : object is not subsetable


You might argue that this approach is unnecessary now that R allows
subscripts that are out of range (e.g., force<-list(); force[["name"]] <- 42)
but I changed a lot of code to work as above, and I really don't like
the idea of reverting.

I don't think it's healthy to try and subset NULL... You could use
just

force <- vector(mode = "list", length = 1)
names(force) <- somename

or, for general length vectors,

force <- vector(mode = "list", length = k)
names(force) <- character(k)
for (i in 1:k) 
	names(force)[i]<- something.dependent.on(i)

Hi All,

I'm running R 0.63 on Redhat 5.1 and when I attempt
to load a fortran routine I get:

> dyn.load("/home/royle/Rstuff/varna.o")

Error in dyn.load(x) : unable to load shared library "/home/royle/Rstuff/varna.o"


this function varna.o was compiled with:

 gcc -c varna.f

with no errors or warnings.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

Thanks! (and thanks to everyone who replied to my previous query

Contrary to S[-plus], dyn.load(.) in R  only allows the dynamic loading
of shared libraries.

Insofar, dyn.load(.) maybe should have been called
	 dyn.load.shared()  instead.

You have to add (to the above)

	R SHLIB varna.o -o varna.so

or even do this at once:

	R SHLIB varna.c


and then

	dyn.load("....../varna.so")

----
In addition to  
	help(dyn.load),
	help(SHLIB),
see also in  RHOME/demos/dynload  and look at the Makefile.

  I did not get this error in previous versions (just tried it again for
R-0.62.3 which completes configure successsfully)

  I see the messages about Solaris 2.6 relating to versions of gnu make.
It does make me wonder if configure needs the latest g77.  Could that be
the problem?  We are using g77 version 5.21 (and gnu make version 3.74).

You need to look at config.log. This file contains a list of what
configure tried to do and what happened. If you post the section of
config.log dealing with "checking for underscore after Fortran symbols" it
should be possible to work out what's wrong.

Hi,

first versions of RPMs of R and its libraries for SuSE 5.3 are available
at CRAN:

   ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R/bin/linux/suse/

I compiled it with gcc and g77 from egcs 1.1b. 

There are still some problems:

  + the "event", "gnlm", ... libraries are missing (g77 complains about  
    wrong declarations)
  + "modreg" does not work (library contains unresolved symbols)
  + "e1071" currently has no support for pgm routines.

But I hope to solve these problems step by step.

PS:
Here is the README file from 
ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R/bin/linux/suse/5.3/RPMS/i386/README

R packages for S.u.S.E. Linux
=============================

These packages are compiled with egcs 1.1b on S.u.S.E 5.3.

The latest versions are always available at
 
     ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/R/bin/linux/suse/5.3/

and mirrored at CRAN under

     ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R/bin/linux/suse/5.3/ 

Libraries (libreadline and libblas) are statically linked, so you need 
no extra packages with shared libraries.

Each package is divided into two parts "R-<name>" with the binaries and files 
needed at runtime and "R-<name>-source" with the appropriate source tree.

If you are not interested in the source tree you can omit all "R-<name>-source"
packages.

You will need at least R-x.xx-y.i386.rpm, which contains the base installation
of R (with x.xx.y replaced by the version number from R-x.xx.y.tgz). 
All other libraries from CRAN/contrib have their own packages.

Directories:

base/         base package
contrib/      library packages
source/       source trees for base and library packages (no source-RPMs!)
all-in-one/   one big package with all libraries and whole source tree
ess/          packages with ESS-mode for GNU Emacs and XEmacs

Of course, you can also find the source-RPMs here (../../SRPMS/). I use them
not only for S.u.S.E. Linux but also for Digital Unix, see
 
     ftp://ftp.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/uni-klu.ac.at/rpms/osf1/alpha/


PS:
RPMs with egcs 1.1b for S.u.S.E 5.3 are also available at 

     ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/RPMS/i386/

Well, here is configure.log, but I don't see any more information than the
echo's which I posted.  (except for line numbers in configure)

configure:1175: gcc -o conftest    conftest.c  1>&5
configure:1195: checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) is a
cross-compiler
configure:1200: checking whether we are using GNU C
configure:1209: gcc -E conftest.c
configure:1224: checking whether gcc accepts -g
configure:1316: checking for ranlib
configure:1380: checking for g77
configure:1468: checking for underscore after Fortran symbols

Has anything changed in the conftestf.f test?
This seems quite strange that ./configure runs fine in the parallel
directory   $RHOME/R-0.62.4  but not in $RHOME/R-0.63

Thanks, Jim

Subject: [R] Debian Linux package of R-0.63.0
Message-ID: <6rr9uzscs3.fsf@verdi.stat.wisc.edu>

I have created a Debian Linux package of R-0.63.0 as r-base_0.63.0-1.
The source package and i386 binary package are on the master Debian
archive (ftp.debian.org) and its mirrors under the "potato" (2.2
development) distribution.  The version of R that will be shipped with
Debian 2.1 is r-base_0.62.4-1.  By the time R-0.63.0 was released the
2.1 release of Debian was frozen.

The i386 binary is, or will soon be, on the CRAN sites in the
		     $CRAN/bin/linux/debian/2.0/
directory.  You can install this binary on a 2.0 or a 2.1 or a 2.2
system.

Subject: [R] R data import problems
Message-ID: <199811192018.VAA10510@uni-bremen.de>


Excuse me, if the following is FAQ or nonsense, I'm new to R (and the
list)! 

After trying to import a textfile of 184897 Bytes, R (v0.63.0 on Linux
2.0.35/DLD 5.4) gives the following error message:

  > read.table ("db.out")
  Error: heap memory (1953 Kb) exhausted [needed 150 Kb more]
  >                                                 

Is there a possibility to increase heap size to import larger files?
Files up to 100 k are imported correctly. The file contains a single
column with a floating point value on each row.

Second question: Is it possible to construct an extension that
facilitates the import of data from databases, e.g. postgresql? (or
does it already exist?)

I have something like 

  > DataF <- read.fromDB ("select aaa, bbb from data", dbURL)

in mind, given that dbURL is the URL of a database accessible over
jdbc, odbc and alike, for example? (a separate connect-to-db-function
to handle database access/connect is more realistic, of course). There
would have to be an interface which connects to the db, executes the
query by passing the sql statement ("select ..."), and finally
delivers the output to R (or gives an error message, if necessary).

Many thanks for your attention,
Ulf

What operations are available in R for combining and matching

I have a similar question, I know about --vsize, but I use R under Emacs
using ESS.  I know there is an easy way to call R from ESS with command
line options but I don't remember how.  I can't find help on this in ESS
documentation or in R documentation.

Could someone please remind me how this is done.

with ESS, I thought I'd programmed in an interface for this:

Something like,
	C-u M-x R 
would prompt for command line options.

Martin, am I dreaming?  (seems to happen often, sigh...).

One way is, instead of just M-x R, type C-u M-x R.  This will ask for
command line arguments to pass.  I am sure there is also an emacs
variable to control this, but can't say offhand what it is.

Three of the contrib packages (event, repeated and rmutil) contain a

where (at least in R 0.63) just a plain Mathlib.h will do.

Also the contrib package e1071 contains a file src/pnm.c which refers
to a pnm.h file that is not found on my system (nor in the package

For Debian Systems, you can find pgm.h (and libnetpbm) in the netpbm
package.

               the help examples (the one needed by the new

- rw0630w.zip: documentation in html format (usable but far from

- rw0630s.zip: source.


Changes (with respect to rw0624)
--------------------------------
- Minor adjustment to reflect changes in R-0.63.0
  (options, example,...)
- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in the graphics device.  
- More control keys (some Emacs like (crtl+a, crtl+e, crtl+k),
  and, on popular demand, crtl+c and crtl-v for copy and paste);
  take a look at the help/console menuitem.
- Added support for Cygwin B20 (target remains Mingw32,i.e, 
  no Unix emulation layer)
- Access of global variables in R.exe from a dll should work
  (all the orrible name-mangling needed by `gnuwin32' -
   `var' in R.exe becames `*__imp_var' in a dll - is done
   automatically).

I am a Windows user of R. Could somebody give me a concrete
example of how to install a package in R? I have tried to
follow the Appendix C of "R complements to Modern Applied
Statistics with S-Plus", but I can not success.

Thanks in advance,

I must admit that I don't fully appreciate the scoping rules in R.
For instance:

myfunc <-function(tt, event, x)
   {
     cat(tt, "\n")
     coxph(Surv(tt, event) ~ x)
   }

Running

R> myfunc(c(1:4), rep(1, 4), c(1,0,1,0))

gives as output:

1 2 3 4 
Error: Object "tt" not found

i.e., cat  "sees"  tt, but not  coxph. Why?
How do I call coxph within a function, with arguments
being local or formal parameters? Is it possible to write
R  functions so that the scopning rules will be as in Fortran
or C?

This seems to be a bug in coxph, I'm already looking into it.  However,
the scoping rules are more complicated in the case of model formulae than
for normal functions.  Most functions that use model formulae explicitly
bypass the normal scoping rules using eval(). This is to allow the formula
and other objects like weights= and subset= to be evaluated in a supplied
data frame.

There is a genuine problem with model frames and formulae in keeping track
of where things should be evaluated.  In this case you clearly want it
evaluated in the calling frame, but if you had fitted a cox model and did

myotherfunc<-function(object){
	residuals(object,type="score")
}

you would want the object's model frame recomputed in the global
environment (or wherever it was first computed). The regression objects do
not necessarily store enough information to do this.

Sorry, those instructions are for Unix only (and the current version says so: 
earlier versions did say that the information for Windows was provisional).

For Guido's R-0.63.0 announced today you need the right compilers
and help pages from Unix (until I have got my setup to do this working
portably).  For Rjune I do not have the right tools.

Which package were you interested in?  I intend to have pre-compiled
versions for Guido's R-0.63.0 and R-0.62.4 available very soon (and
he may be doing some too).  This will be as simple as

cd to library
unzip
add a line to LibIndex

Hi,

I've been playing with R for only a few days, so I'm not terribly
familiar with it yet.  Has anyone ever done any work using HDF or
NetCDF files with R?  Both file formats have libraries which can be
linked to a program to read and write data to these formats.  Is this
sort of thing possible with R?  We are planning to use the HDF format to
store experimental data collected by some research instruments we are
designing.  I would like to be able to use R for the data analysis?  Is
this feasible?  Both file formats have structures which make their use
with R an attractive prospect.

Yes.  Steve Oncley <oncley at ucar.edu> wrote back in May

  You may be interested that almost all of the data we read into S+ is
  NetCDF. This has involved writing a bit of C code to link to the Unidata
  C library, which we load into S and are then called with .C().  I have
  enclosed the comments from our core S+ routine below.  Calls to this
  routine handle opening multiple files and assigning S+ attributes such 
  as time and units-of-measure (read from the NetCDF attributes).

  All of our code is available upon request (simply because I'm not sure
  that it is in shape yet for public distribution).  I plan to convert all
  of it to R as part of configuring a new laptop next month :)

More recently we have received some HDF support code (I've lost the
message, but I would expect it has been archived). It wasn't included in
R0.63 because it used a lot of gcc-specific features that would break in
standard C compilers.

hdf5load() and hdf5save() are in 0.63. You need to have the relevant
include and library files installed when building R in order to make
them work, though.

Thank you for the clarification. Does this mean that it is impossible

  Since 0.62.4, under Windows, LibIndex isn't used anymore. library() will
  list the available packages without looking to it,i.e,
  also the last step can be avoided!!

That code was reorganized to be portable, and is in fact distributed
with R0.63.  Also note the support is for the new HDF5 library, not
the more prevalent HDF4 library.

That makes no sense. Genetic algorithms, like the EM-algorithm, are
methods not algorithms. They need extensive tailoring to a problem.
You cannot write general code for non-algorithms (by definition).

There is an on-line version via CRAN, so why do you want it in dvi (if
that is what you meant)?

Not much, eh?  

I have put 2 zip files of packages of compiled for Guido Masarotto's port
of R-0.63.0 at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/win32

lib1.zip contains

VR (MASS, class, nnet, spatial), tree

lib2.zip contains

KernSmooth acepack akima boot bootstrap cluster ctest integrate
logspline pspline rpart splines survival4

In each case cd to .../rw0630/library and unzip. All are the latest
versions on CRAN or later (if mine).

These all contain text and html help files, and the files for example(). I
have done a modest amount of re-mapping to avoid name clashes on
case-insensitive file systems.  To ensure that cross-links work, you
probably will need my file help.zip and unpack it in the parent of rw0630:
this replaces Guido's rw0630h and rw0630w and consistently uses mapped
names: the packages and functions html link to all these libraries. 

As for the remaining ones, I have no intention of porting libraries that
are not written in standard code and that I cannot even get to work on
Solaris; you do not need ppr (it is part of modreg) and xgobi is only of
any use to you if you use my Windows port of Xgobi which works
virtually unchanged on R.  I will port the next release of lme, equivalent
to nlme3.0b5. [In two cases in this set g77 failed on perfectly legal
Fortran, and in two cases I had to supply missing library routines so even
correct code needs tweaking. Certain authors seems to have no regard for
standards!]

I will post to R-devel shortly (probably tomorrow) details of the tools
used to build the help on these.

All of this is very experimental, so do be careful not to trust the
results.  As gunwin32 R has no batch mode, I cannot check standard scripts
easily and have only run cursory checks.  Later Guido and I will work out
a way to have pre-compiled on CRAN.

How difficult would it be to create one? I suspect that all you need
is to avoid starting up the console and do stdio instead. The ESS
(Emacs Speaks Statistics) crowd will want this as well.

Use GNU make. Not 3.77 unfortunately, it has a bug. 

The problem is that Sun's make doesn't allow wildcards in
dependencies. Or rather, it has a different syntax than most other
makes. An alternative would be to fixup all wildcard refs with
something like

ALLSRC:sh = echo ....src/*/*.[chfy])

... : $(ALLSRC)


Of course, this doesn't work with any *other* version of "make". 

These Makefile incompatibilities are a major pain! Anyone happen to
know if there's a document giving an overview of which features are
present on which version of which OS's?

Using Martin Plummer's source rpms, I have started putting together binary
rpms for linuxppc.

The current rpms are:
	R-base-0.63-3.ppc.rpm
	R-VR-5.3pl030-1.ppc.rpm
	R-contrib-1998.11.20-1.ppc.rpm

These are (or will be) found at:
	1)  CRAN/bin/linux/linuxppc/
	2)  ftp://biocserver.cwru.edu/pub/linuxppc/
		(science apps for linuxppc ftp site)
	3)  ftp://ftp.linuxppc.org/pub/linuxppc/linuxppc-R4/contrib/RPMS/
		(and its mirrors)

I hope these are useful to someone else.

Yowch! Good spotting, Thomas. Yes, that has to be a major obstacle.
I suppose we'd better rename that directory.

But how on earth did Guido's port get made, then?

Thank you very much!
Under Windows 95, everything works OK!!.

With Windows 98, I got problems with dynamic loading.
For example:

> library(nnet)
Error: dynamic library `nnet' not found
> detach(package:nnet)
> detach(package:nnet)
Error: invalid name
> 

... I got the same problem with: nnet, spatial, tree, KernSmooth, 
acepack, akima, logspline, pspline, rpart, survival4.

I did not have this error with: MASS, boot, bootstrap,cluster, ctest,
integrate, splines, Modreg. However, when I try to use a date set from
MASS I got the following:

> library(MASS)
> data(cat)

The same error has happened with data sets from boot:

Subject: [R] Additional autoconf test for linuxppc/mklinux
Message-ID: <3659F903.7C4127F3@mediaone.net>

I am attaching a patch to R-0.63's configure.in file which will enable 
R to detect and use some special math libraries on linuxppc and mklinux.
The patch provides tests for these libraries and enable/disable switches 
for them as well.

One library is the libmoto math library which must be used in
conjunction
with libm (it only replaces some of libm's functions).  The other is a
RISC optimized BLAS library, libblas_risc, which must be used along with
a standard implementation of BLAS, libblas.  It only provides optimized 
versions of GEMM routines for single and double precision real values.

Please let me know if the tests cause problems on other architectures.

Yes, and I get that behaviour too with the cygnus version of tar, which
specifically refuses to create files with such names (and a directory is a
file). There are workarounds, but if you are trying to build rw0630, you do
not need that directory.

Do these have support for HDF5?  Just last night, I worked up a proper
configuration file to build HDF5 on linuxppc/mklinux.  I've sent the
powerpc-linux config file to NCSA and placed it on my machine's
anonymous ftp site.

ftp://keeshond.aerodyne.com/pub/HDF

I had previously ported HDF4.1 to powerpc linux machines at work.  My
plan is to build an rpm for HDF5 over the Thanksgiving holiday, and then
rebuild R-0.63 with HDF5 support.  Perhaps I'll piggyback off of your
efforts and build rpms when I'm done.

Hi,

 First time on this list. Here it goes
I am trying to find Loess. I could not find it on the windows version. Is
there one in either Unix version of R or some C program somewhere?
  I tried one from http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/a/, but I cannot get
it to compile due to problem with missing lib (I think):

cc -o gas.x gas.o loessc.o loess.o predict.o misc.o loessf.o -llinpack -lcor
-lm -lF77
ld: fatal: library -llinpack: not found
ld: fatal: library -lcor: not found
ld: fatal: File processing errors.  No output written to gas.x
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `gas.x'

  In addition, I cannot get Unix verison of official R through my netscape.
Is there ftp site address?
  Thanks in adv,

Try the win32-devel version rw0630 on CRAN: it is in library modreg.
That version is already very good, but even better Windows versions are
not far off.

loess was added to version 0.63.0 in library modreg (by me, as it happens).

Solaris make doesn't work with the R Makefile. You need to get GNU make,
(but *not* version 3.77, which has a bug).

You will need to obtain and install the GNU version of make.

Hi,

  I am trying to put some nice GUI using something like VB and use R as a

  I am willing to look at any tools on Sun/Solaris environment as well (Like

For the record, the bug surfaces only on Solaris 2.6 or later, as far as I
know (and I did try 3.77 on our Solaris 2.5.1 during the development of
0.63).

There has been some work done by John Lapeyre on using R as the
backend for the perl data language (pdl).  I believe he was not
working through sockets or anything like that.  He was using the R
source code.

 Package: r-pdl
 Section: math
 Installed-Size: 982
 Maintainer: John Lapeyre <lapeyre at physics.arizona.edu>
 Version: 0.2-2
 Depends: pdl
 Description: 'R' statistics for the perl data language
  r-pdl is an interface to a  collection of about
  100 routines from the R statistics language, for pdl,
  the perl data language.  The routines give information
  and random deviates from common distributions used in
  statistics.  Provisions for a user defined random
  number generator have been added to the original R
  code.

You can get the source code for this off any Debian GNU/Linux archive,
such as ftp.debian.org.  From the top of the archive the path will
look like debian/dists/slink/main/source/math/r-pdl_0.2-2.tar.gz

Recently Thomas Lumley announced a sockets library for R.  I'm not
sure if that allows R to act as a server.  Perhaps Thomas can comment.

Another, related project called omega (http://omega.stat.wisc.edu/) is
just underway.  A goal of that project is to provide distributed
statistical computing through CORBA modules.

Yes, you could use it that way. You can set up either server or client
sockets. It currently only passes strings over the connections, but you
can always use parse() then eval() to evaluate them. 


You might also be able to replace the input and output code in
src/unix/system.c or the event loop in src/windows/wincons.c

If you want to do this on Windows, the latest version of Guido Masarotto's
R port has the R engine as a DLL and two specimen (but very useful) front
ends.  It looks very easy to mimic these to call into that DLL from any of
the Windows systems (VB, VC++, Delphi) you mention, although as this
development is so new, I doubt if anyone has tried it yet. You can of
course build a special-purpose version of that DLL with additional hooks if
you need it. (This is essentially a pre-packed version of Thomas'
suggestion.)

As I understand those terms, they apply to the output of a factor analysis,
and I am not aware of that being implemented in R.

You are here in a rather specialised (and not at all widely accepted) area
of statistics, and would be better off using a specialist package. I made a
deliberate decision not to implement factor analysis in R.

Rotation is sometimes applied to the output of a principal components
analysis, but that is even more controversial.

I think the answers are no, nowhere, yes, look at 
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/win32/makehelp.zip
although Guido may have a version without any help files.

However, more generally our (Guido + I) intentions are to build
libraries for the rw63-io version which Guido has put up, and as it is 
a lot of effort to do this twice, please be a little patient.  My hope
is that by Monday a version of rw63-io, help files, and ports of all the 
current CRAN libraries will be available for download.  If we do this right,
those libraries will work with all subsequent versions of R-0.63.

PS: could you please give us a real address in a signature. My site cannot
resolve 148.224.17.2, and the numerical form gives it no hints to speed the
search. And lots of sites will refuse mail from sites they cannot resolve
as an anti-spam measure.

  I have just upload to ftp://ftp.stat.unipd.it/users/guido/R/libraries
  binary version of rmutil and gnlm, and BTW, since I have them
  on my HD also cclust, gee, multiv, leaps, lme, polymars, polynom,
  sgeostat, stable.
  They all includes the help (text+html) but not the examples.
  To install, just download  the files you want and then unzip
  them in rw0630/library. If you want the html documntation
  linked to the others launch R and run 
  > make.packages.html()
  
  With respect to the other Jim Lindsey's packages you can try using
  the instructions in the Brian Ripley's makehelp files, BUT
  if I rebember egcc-g77 (which is the current Fortran compiler used

I know (F90 constructs) and I now know how to fix them (apart form using
f2c on Windows, which does exist). My plan remains: a complete consistent
set of libraries by Monday.

Subject: [R] heap memory exhausted
Message-ID: <365DE666.C1A53A55@gmx.net>

Hi
I always have following error message when I try to read
a big ascii-file:
> inzp<-read.data()
> Error: heap memory (1953 Kb) exhausted [needed 0 Kb more]
read.data() is a small function that reads the ascii-file.
When I cut the ascii-file to a small one I don't have this
problem.
Can I extend this 'heap memory' for reading big data files? How?
I'm working with R on a Linux PC-machine.
Thank you for your help!
Rolf

There is a command line option -v which sets the size of the heap in
megabytes.  Try
	R -v10
or, if you have lots of memory
	R -v100

Take a look at the FAQ (address below). 

In the meantime, use R -v 30 (if you want to
allocate 30 MB to R, say). See also the -n option.

I am running R (verion ) for windows under Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
SP3. When I try to start R from a command prompt window using 

    D:\R\rw0630\bin>R -v10

I get a "Dr. Watson" error message which says: 

   "An application error has occurred and an application error 
    log is being generated. 

                        R.exe

    Exception: access violation (0x0000005), Address: 0x004016db"

Would anyone know what is causing that? Other values of -v also cause 
problems, even -v2 or -v1. 

The hardware is a PII 266 MHz, 128 MB RAM. 

Here is what's in the log file:

-----------------------------------

I'm also using R 0.63 (Guido's port) on NT4 SP3, and get the same message
whenever I try to start R from the command prompt (even without the
options, just simply typing "R" in the D:\R\rw0630\bin folder).

On the other hand, if you want to increase the memory available for R, you
can create a Windows shortcut for R, and change the command line in the
properties dialogue. You should note that the options '-v' and '-n' are now
called '--vsize' and '--nsize' respectively, so that the command line
should look something like 
"D:\R\rw0630\bin>R.exe --nsize 300000 --vsize 10".

I've also noticed that the R event loop uses 100% of the CPU!!!
While you have R command window open waiting for the commands to be

Hi,

I need to perform survival analysis and could not find the S+ functions:

- survfit (fits a Kaplan-Meier survival curve), or
- coxph (fits a Cox proportional hazards model)

in R. Are there any alternative functions available? 

Thanks,

Alvaro

Dear friends,

I am trying to port a collection of S-PLUS teaching functions over to R.
Several of my functions use animation.  Animation in S-PLUS is not ideal,
but can be accomplished with a call to guiLocator (this forces the program
to print to the graphsheet rather than wait until the function has completed
all calculations).   Does anyone know if there is a trick that will enable
me to accomplish the same thing in R (for Windows).

Many thanks for any and all help


Niels

Here you are talking about S-PLUS 4.x. That `trick' is not needed on any
other S-PLUS platform, not even on earlier versions of S-PLUS for Windows.
Only with a graphsheet device in S-PLUS 4.x is (plot) output deferred.  I
don't see it is relevant to R.

BTW, as we now many versions of R for Windows (and are about to have some
more) could you please say which?

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.96.981128001121.4739B-100000@ysidro>

Hi,

I have been trying to dyn.load a library (rq.obj), which will allow me to run
a quantile regression function, but so far unsuccessfully.
I have tried under windows 98 and R 6.24:

1) dyn.load("d:\\...\\rq.obj")
2) dyn.load("d:\...\rq.obj")
3) 1 and 2 accounting for case sensitivity.
4) dyn.load("d:/.../rq.obj")
5) Place the files in the directory where from I start R and then issue the
   command dyn.load("rq.obj").

One way or the other I always get the following error message:

Error in dyn.load(x) : unable to load shared library "D:\Documents\rq.obj" 

NOTE: According to the FAQ, Add-on Packages can only be added under Unix, or at
least, the information there is only for Unix. Is that so, or is it possible
to do it under Windows 98? I am a newbie, but I believe that I have a package
since it contains several files with extensions .s, .r, .q  and so on.
This quantile regression package was prepared by Prof. Roger Koenker for 
Windows (he uses Unix).

Has this happened to you? Any ideas? I would really appreciate your help.

Thanks a zillion,

These are in the separate survival4 library, available from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network. They are not built in to R because their
license is somewhat different from the GPL and because they would take up
a lot of space

You need to install survival4 and then load it with 
 R>  library(survival4)
if you  need survival analysis.

You might well also want to get the splines library (which is needed by
plot.cox.zph), the ratetables library (which contains the US mortality
rate tables used by survexp) and the date library (which contains date
functions).

There will be a new survival5 library fairly soon (Terry Therneau is
releasing it for S in a few weeks, and I expect it will be fairly easy to 
port)

Dear Friends,

Yesterday I posed a question to the list concerning the possibility of doing
animation examples in R.  Here is an example S-Plus (4.5 for Windows ) that
I wrote to illustrate my problem.  If I try this in R (comment out the
graphsheet and guilocator calls) I don't see my results until after the
function has iterated through the 100 trials.  I would like to plot each
iteration.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I am running R 63.0 (Guido's
latest version for Windows).

Niels


> Quincunx.prg
function(trials = 100)
{
 graphsheet(pages = "Off")
 par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
 xpoints <- seq(1, 25, 1)
 ypoints <- seq(1, 25, 1)
 xheights <- rep(0, 25)
 mcol <- 2
 xy <- expand.grid(xpoints, ypoints)
 xx <- seq(1, 25, 2)
 yy <- rep(0, 25)
 ypos <- ypoints + 0.4
 HT <- c("H", "T")
 for(j in 1:trials) {
  plot(xpoints, ypoints, type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", axes = F, main =
"Galton's Quincunx")
  points(x = xy[, 1], y = xy[, 2], pch = 5, col = 1)
  marble.path <- sample(HT, 25, replace = T)
  xpos <- 13
  points(xpos, ypos[25], pch = 16, col = 8)
  for(i in 1:24) {
   if(marble.path[i] == "H")
    xpos <- xpos + 1
   else xpos <- xpos - 1
   if(xpos > 25)
    xpos <- 25
   if(xpos < 0)
    xpos <- 0

I run into the same problem of getting animation to work on
R (gnuwin32), and asked G. Masarotto. He responded:

"About animation: graphics devices are updated only when something
is printed or some input is required. However, it is easy to force
updating: just print the null string when you want,i.e.,
in your case add the line
  cat("")
before the delay loop (at the end of Walk(...)).
I suppose that this is not completly satisfactory for more
complex animation. So, I have to rethink to the 
buffering of the graphich device. However, in this
example seems to work.
Let me to know what do you think about and thanks 
for pointing to the two problems.

g. "

By the way,  animation works in RJune.

I also have planned to get Koenker's quantile regression functions to
work under R (Windows), but cannot find something which understands
ratfor.  If anyone can point me to that, I'll give it a try soon.

Specifically to the Q's:

1) dyn.load("d:\\...\\rq.obj")
> 2) dyn.load("d:\...\rq.obj")

Trying to lode the code compiled for S is optimistic, I beleave
that to be 16-bit DLL's which R will not understand. They must
be recompiled, which is easy, given that the ratfor problem can be
solved.

Try the following:

 Quincunx.prg  <-  
function(trials = 100)
{
 # graphsheet(pages = "Off")

 # Init: 
 par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
 xpoints <- seq(1, 25, 1)
 ypoints <- seq(1, 25, 1)
 xheights <- rep(0, 25)
 mcol <- 2
 xy <- expand.grid(xpoints, ypoints)
 xx <- seq(1, 25, 2)
 yy <- rep(0, 25)
 ypos <- ypoints + 0.4
 HT <- c("H", "T")

 # First loop:
 for(j in 1:trials) {
  plot(xpoints, ypoints, type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", axes = F,
main =
       "Galton's Quincunx")
  cat("")
  points(x = xy[, 1], y = xy[, 2], pch = 5, col = 1)
  cat("")
  marble.path <- sample(HT, 25, replace = T)
  xpos <- 13
  points(xpos, ypos[25], pch = 16, col = 8)
  cat("")
  for(i in 1:24) {
   if(marble.path[i] == "H")
    xpos <- xpos + 1
   else xpos <- xpos - 1
   if(xpos > 25)
    xpos <- 25
   if(xpos < 0)
    xpos <- 0
   points(xpos, ypos[25 - i], pch = 16, col = 8)
   cat("")
  }
  xheights[xpos] <- xheights[xpos] + 1
  text(x = xpoints[xx], y = yy[xx], labels = as.character(xheights)[xx])
  cat("")
  plot(xpoints[xx], xheights[xx], ylim = c(0, trials/2), type = "h",
main =
       paste("Trials = ", j, sep = ""), ylab = "Frequency",
   xlab = "X")
  cat("")
  # guiLocator(-1) 
  cat("")
 }
}

Note all the dummy cat("") calls, after calls to functions producing
graphical output. (thats the trick Guido M. told me) It is still not
perfect, but at least works.

I have my own install problems. Trying to make R-0.63 on a brand
new linux (red hat 5.0) installation, logged in as root. 

Everything seems to work as it should, configure, make, so on
runs without any error messages. BUT: No binary is made. I am

Subject: [R] Question about dotplot
Message-ID: <01J4QXLOUJAQ000166@bentley.edu>

Hello:

I am playing with the dotplot command (in preparation for 
teaching an EDA course). I do not understand the following 
behaviour of dotplot when x is a vector. These examples 
have been tried on both Linux version 0.63 and guido's 
Windows version 0.63 running under Windows 95.
I searched the bug reporting system, but found no mention
of any report concerning dotplot.

x <- 1:26
names(x) <- letters

# y has 10 zeros, 10 ones, and 6 twos.
y <- c(rep(0,10), rep(1,10), rep(2,6)) 
y <- factor(y, labels = c("G1","G2", "G3"))

# lcolor="black" since dotted gray lines don't display
# properly in my Windows version.

dotplot(x,groups=y, lcolor="black") 
--------------------------------------------------------
The dotplot groups the a-f components of x and labels them 
G1, groups the g-p components of x and labels them G2, and 
groups the q-z components of x and labels them G3. I would 
have expected the first 10 components of x to be grouped 
together with the G1 label, followed by the next 10 
components with label G2, then the last 6 components with 
label G3.
---------------------------------------------------------

# z has 5 zeros, then 10 ones, then 5 zeros, then 6 ones.
z <- c(rep(0,5), rep(1,10), rep(0,5), rep(1,6))
z <- factor(z, labels = c("G1", "G2"))
dotplot(x,groups=z, lcolor="black")
----------------------------------------------------------

This groups components a,b,c,d,e,p, then a break, then 
components q,r,s,t, then a break, then f to o, then a break, 
then u to z. The G1 label is aligned at the same level as 
the d entry, and the G2 label is aligned with the m entry.

Does this make sense?

Thank you.

  I have tried to replicate the error under Win95 and 98 but with
  a limited lucky (I hoped this of course!!): I only had
  problem launching R from a Cygnus console bad configured
  (but this is a known problem of Cygnus bash, not of R).
  I will try again under NT during next week (I haven't
  one available now).

  This is due to the fact that this version of R isn't  event
  driven.
  This should not give problems, i.e., the system should
  be able to run other tasks in parallel with R without problems;
  it should be also able to run more than one copy of R 
  at the same time sharing CPU resources. 
  Is this true?
  BTW, it depends in part also from how task manager measures CPU usage,
  i.we, the same console runned under Linux with the same event loop
  compares in the 'top' list (top lists all the processes active)
  as using 0% of the CPU.

Happens on Unix too, and no: it doesn't make sense...

I believe the blunder is in here:
    else {
        o <- rev(order(as.numeric(groups)))
        x <- x[o]
        groups <- groups[o]
        offset <- cumsum(c(0, diff(as.numeric(groups)[o]) != 
            0))
        y <- 1:n + 2 * offset
        ylim <- range(0, y + 2)
    }

groups is getting ordered *twice* there. Dropping the [o] in the
diff() makes the extra gaps go away, but now the group labels look
wrong. Oh, well.

Can anyone summarize what was said about R in the article?  If there

I must admit, though, the my abilities in German are much less
impressive than the abilities in English of most of the native
German-speakers in this group.  A summary in English would be most welcome.

It is worth mentioning that only R got more coverage in the article than
ViSta (other programs being Splus, Stata, P-Stat, PSPP, XploRe).

Are you sure that make did not report any error messages? Unfortunately in
R0.63 make does not stop on errors, so it is easy to miss an error message
as it scrolls past.  Using a Red Hat 5.0 installation with fort77 as the
Fortran compiler there is a problem with the configuration: the
linker is set up as
	fort77 -export-dynamic
but fort77 doesn't recognise this flag.  If the -export-dynamic flag is
removed from Makeconf (and possibly etc/Makeconf) then I can compile.

OK, fixed for 0.63.1. Here's the patch (cut'n'pasted in from another

The article is a survey of software for statistics ("Statistical data
analysis with Linux"). The author (Dr. Wenzel Matiaske,
<wm at perform.ww.tu-berlin.de>, address according to Linux Magazin)
gives informations about

      P-STAT
      Stata     
      S-Plus 5
      XploRe
      ViSta (and XLisp-Stat)
      R (0.62.2)
      PSPP (FIASCO)

I haven't time to translate everything (and that's better for the
native English speaker, anyway ;-) ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

About R he says (summarised!!): R is like XploRe a statistical
programming language and system for graphical and numerical data
analysis. Was written by ... similar to S ... can use code written for
S and S' documentation ... existence of CRAN ... availability as
deb/rpm package, additional libraries are on CRAN, too ... some
installation hints (FORTRAN translator, Perl5 necessary). R has a
simple interactive user interface ... demo ()/help () ... more
comfortable emacs interface exists ... graphical representation
possible with Xgobi (screen-shot with emacs & Xgobi). As example of R
there is a box with code showing how to make a histogram, a
correlation analysis and a linear regression; the code is explained in
the text. Number of existing procedures is considered impressive
... base package contains all possibilities of univariate analysis and
many methods for statistical modelling (linear Model, generalised
linear model) ... in the libraries there are: ctests, tree, cluster,
eda, mva, multiv, MASS (purpose of the modules is explained
shortly). Something is still missing: "Kreuztabellenanalyse" -- cross
table analysis? --, MANOVA, factor analysis, general additive
models. But the number of functions is increasing, and there are
Fortran/C interfaces. R not tailored to data storing, importing,
report generation, in this respect needs help of a database or another
data analysis system.

The author summarises: XploRe and R are recommended as programming
environments and contain the biggest number of statistical models
(there is a table comparing all programs by supported statistical
methods and user interface facilities).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please excuse for translation errors and misunderstandings (I'm no
expert in statistics!).

Hope it helps ...

Subject: [R] R for Windows -- packages
Message-ID: <199811301117.LAA04476@toucan.stats.ox.ac.uk>

At

	http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/win32/

I have made available ports to Guido Masarotto's rw0630 version of a large
number of packages, basically all those on CRAN except purely data collections.
Please read the instructions in the README file.

Also there is a set of dlls in new/iodlls.zip that enable most (but not
yet all) of these to work with the rw63-io version, and
new/bdr0631.zip, a port of Friday's R-release with some extra features
(notably sending help pages to a browser) which all needs the iodlls.

I have tested these under Win95 and NT4.0.  We don't have a Win98 machine,
but Guido does and reports no problems with my earlier files (now removed).
Please do unpack with unzip or a recent WinZip.

I confirm that both R.exe and Rgui.exe will not run from a NT4 commands
window (nor from Cygwin bash on any system). Make a shortcut and run
from that.  Unfortunately rterm will not either, so until that is
fixed, `batch' mode only works on Win9x.

An update of making packages on win32 will appear shortly.  Meanwhile
the latest R complements to V&R
(http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2/compl.shtml) contain more
information on using Windows versions, even on installing and making
packages.

Finally: from the README:

    Very little testing has been done: please report problems but do not
    expect quick repairs.

All I have done is tested that the libraries load and run one or two examples,
except for my own libraries where I have run all the V&R scripts.

Subject: [R] Animation and a better Quincunx
References: <000401be1b07$2d11b9d0$3a5aeda9@caprice.ucdavis.edu> <36618A84.786DB271@alumni.uv.es>
Message-ID: <36625E93.258EB6CF@alumni.uv.es>

The solution I sent yesterday, only changing the original
Quincunx.prg() adding the magic cat(""), isn't very satisfactory.

This is a complicated animation, using two panels, and (at least
on rw063) drawing in only one panel destroys the content of the
other. A better possibility seems to use (the new) function
split.screen, see Quincunx.screen appended at tail. 

That led into some other problems as well:

Quincunx.screen eats memory, with a standard memory
configuration runs out of heap at around trial 50. There
is no intrinsic reason why the memory needs of an animation
should depend on the number of frames seen?

after choosing screen s with screen(s), using a high level
plot function once doesnt destroy the other screens, but the
second times it does. A Bug?

There is some overlap between screens. Look at he ylab of the
second screen, "Frecuency", under animation!



 Quincunx.screen  <-  
function(trials = 100)
{
  # Init: 
  #par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
 split.screen(c(1,2), erase=FALSE) # split.screen isn't in RJune
 xpoints <- seq(1, 25, 1)
 ypoints <- seq(1, 25, 1)
 xheights <- rep(0, 25)
 mcol <- 2
 xy <- expand.grid(xpoints, ypoints)
 xx <- seq(1, 25, 2)
 yy <- rep(0, 25)
 ypos <- ypoints + 0.4
 HT <- c("H", "T")

 # First loop:
 for(j in 1:trials) {
  screen(1)
  # Moved the drawing of the background into the main call. To have it
separate
  # makes the animation to discontinuous. 
  plot(x=xy[, 1], y= xy[, 2], type = "p", xlab = "", ylab = "", axes =
F, main =
       "Galton's Quincunx", pch=5, col="brown", cex=0.25) # Plotting in
the first panel.
  cat("")
  #points(x = xy[, 1], y = xy[, 2], pch = 5, col = "brown", cex=0.3)
  #cat("")
  marble.path <- sample(HT, 25, replace = T)
  xpos <- 13
  points(xpos, ypos[25], pch = 16, col = "red")
  cat("")
  for(i in 1:24) {
   if(marble.path[i] == "H")
    xpos <- xpos + 1
   else xpos <- xpos - 1
   if(xpos > 25)
    xpos <- 25
   if(xpos < 0)
    xpos <- 0
   points(xpos, ypos[25 - i], pch = 16, col = "red", cex=0.7)
   cat("")
  } # end inner loop
  xheights[xpos] <- xheights[xpos] + 1
  text(x = xpoints[xx], y = yy[xx], labels = as.character(xheights)[xx])
  cat("")
  screen(2)
  plot(xpoints[xx], xheights[xx], ylim = c(0, trials/2), type = "h",
main =
       paste("Trials = ", j, sep = ""), ylab = "Frequency",
   xlab = "X") # plotting in second panel.
  cat("")
  cat("")
 } # end outer loop
 close.screen()
}

If you want to do this on Windows, the latest version of Guido Masarotto's
R port has the R engine as a DLL and two specimen (but very useful) front
ends.  It looks very easy to mimic these to call into that DLL from any of
the Windows systems (VB, VC++, Delphi) you mention, although as this
development is so new, I doubt if anyone has tried it yet. You can of
course build a special-purpose version of that DLL with additional hooks if
you need it. (This is essentially a pre-packed version of Thomas'
suggestion.)

Is there anything R can do that Splus can't?  I know about the

Are there models you can build or graphs you can plot in R that you

The source to Guido's windows version is on CRAN, cunningly hidden
under "Binaries" in the 
 bin/ms-windows/win-32-devel/ directory. 

The sockets package is not on CRAN, since it will reasonably soon be
part of the R distribution (certainly R0.64, possibly a R0.63.x). It is
at
  http://www.biostat.washington.edu/~thomas/sockets.tgz

Problems which require lots of looping and cannot be re-coded as vector/matrix
operations are theoretically possible but practically infeasible in S, unless
they  are coded in C or Fortran and called from S. These problems seem to run
fine in R.

Since almost anything you can do in R has source code that you could port
to S-PLUS with little effort there will never be much you can do in R that
you couldn't do in S-PLUS (or vanilla S) if you wanted to. Some of the
packages, because they are more recent than similar S(-PLUS) built-in
features may be better designed (eg the tree packages from Terry Therneau
and Brian Ripley, the best-subsets regression code from Alan Miller) but
these could be loaded into S-PLUS if you felt the urge. There's the
occasional little feature: eg pt() allows a non-centrality
parameter for the t-distribution, but again, since the code is freely
available you could dyn.load() it into S-PLUS quite easily.

The graphics functionality is better in some ways: mathematical annotation
of plots, better control of colors in plotting functions than in Unix
S-PLUS. 

As R is much faster on _some_ code than S-PLUS I have also done
simulations in R that I could not do in S-PLUS. Whether this counts as an
added feature is arguable, but it can certainly be useful.

Subject: [R] R functionality -- some of the graphics:

One of the R pluses *is* in the graphics, IMO.


1) It allows  Mathematical Text !!!

   Try
     example(text)

   Unfortunately, this is still mostly undocumented.
   However, Paul Murrell & Ross Ihaka have a paper submitted which
   describes it.  

   A bit (:-) exaggerated,
     `Basically,  R  has TeX inside'  [this is me, not the above authors..].


2) It allows you to specify   line types `very detailed'
     => ?par  has

     lty: The line type.  Line types can either be specified
          as an integer (1=solid, 2=dashed, 3=dotted 4=dot-
          dashed) or as one of the character strings
          `"solid"', `"dashed"', `"dotted"' or `"dot-
          dashed"'.  Alternatively, a string of up to 8
          characters may be given, giving the length (in
          points) of line segments which are alternatively
          drawn and skipped.  For example, `"44"' is dashed
          and `"13"' is dotted.

3) You can more easily specify colors and color palettes.
   
   plot(x,y, col = "purple")

   => ?colors  
      ?palette  
      ?rainbow

   par(ask = T)
   example(palettes)
   
4) You have more par()'s to specify the color and other things of
   main,sub, [xy]lab, .., separately.
	     ==> ?par

5)   There's gamma correction for color.

6)   You can set or fix the aspect ratio of plots  quite generally
      `` par(asp = ..) ''.

     This makes V&R "eqscplot" unnecessary and allows much more;
     further, it allows manual rescaling of the plot and keeps the aspect
     ratio.

At least under Unix there is a good reason (I haven't looked at the
changes in Guido's code to see if it still applies). From help(dev.print)

     Every device has a display list which records all of
     the graphics operations that occur in the device.
     `dev.copy' and `dev.print' copy graphics contents by
     copying the display list from one device to another
     device.  Also, automatic redrawing of graphics contents
     following the resizing of a device depends on the con-
     tents of the display list.

     After the command `dev.control("inhibit")', graphics
     operations are not recorded in the display list so that
     `dev.copy' and `dev.print' will not copy anything and
     the contents of a device will not be redrawn automati-
     cally if the device is resized.

     The recording of graphics operations is relatively
     expensive in terms of memory so the command
     `dev.control("inhibit")' can be useful if memory usage
     is an issue.

It looks like you should try dev.control("inhibit") before animating.
