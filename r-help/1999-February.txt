Subject: [R] graphics: resolution
Message-ID: <199902011102.MAA03898@benes.incoma.cz>

Hi all,
I am using rw0632b on Win95 machine. When printing plots (both, as saved *.gif, and 
copied through clipboard) I get pretty low resolution. Can be the graphics resolution 
paramatrized in some way?
Many thanks!

RedHat switched from ncurses 3 to ncurses 4 between release 5.0
and 5.1, probably to get over the controversy over what ncurses
3 should be called.

Yes. I deliberately link against ncurses 3.0 so that RedHat
5.0 users don't have to upgrade in order to install the R package.
I explain this in the README file.

The guys who build the Alpha and Sparc rpms don't do this.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.95.990201133706.17399B-100000@scooter.gcal.ac.uk>

I have 3 vectors x,y,z:

x<-c(-2.88,-1.92,-.96,0,.96,1.92,2.88,3.84,
-1.92,-.96,0,.96,1.92,2.88,3.84,

1.92,2.88,3.84,
2.88,3.84,
3.84)

y<-c(rep(-3.84,8),
rep(-2.88,7),
rep(-1.92,6),
rep(-.96,5),
rep(0,4),
rep(.96,3),
rep(1.92,2),
2.88)

z<-c(.65,1.78,2.4,2.54,3.04,2.22,2.97,3.56,
.745,1.287,1.98,1.91,2.02,2.24,2.95,

.14,.88,1.87,2.84,
.40,1.61,2.48,
.78,1.93,
.87)

These data sample one triangular corner of a matrix.

I want a plot of the efficiency
zideal<- abs(x-y)/.3 
eff<- (z/zideal)^2

But I can't figure out how to get a persp() plot of eff; this doesn't
work:
persp(x,y,eff,col="grey",theta=45,phi=30)
I tried a trick using unique(x),unique(y) which didn't work.

If I define x, y and z like this:

x<-c(-1.92,-1.44,-.96,-.48,0,.48,.96,1.44,1.92)
y<-x  
z<-rbind(c(NA,.23,.98,1.90,3.60,2.70,3.2,4.11,4.03),
c(NA,NA,.39,1.24,3.85,2.40,2.89,3.26,3.92), 
c(NA,NA,NA,.56,3.26,2.14,2.37,2.67,3.16),
c(NA,NA,NA,NA,2.65,1.02,2.08,2.18,2.96),
c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.88,3.45,3.97,3.97),
c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,.92,1.10,1.90),
c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,.33,1.02),
c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,.26),
c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA))

persp(x,y,z,col="grey",theta=45,phi=30, zlim=c(0,7))

persp works.  However I don't know how to get a plot of eff, since I
don't know how to get eff when z has this form.

So please either tell me how to get a persp plot of x,y,z when in the form
x<- x1,x2,...xn
y<-y1,y2,...yn
z<-z1,z2,...zn

OR tell me how to get the eff matrix from vectors x and y (short) and
matrix z.

Thanks very much for any help!

  This is on my TODO list (help welcomed) but for the moment  answer
  is 'I am sorry, no.". You can use postscript, of course. But
  the gif files and the image saved to the clipboard are just a 
  copy pixel by pixel of the screen picture. So, their resolution is
  bounded to the one of the screen. Only suggestion is:
  try to avoid to resize the saved images (make the R device
  of the dimension you need BEFORE exporting).

The problem is that plotting symbols are restricted to sizes which
match the available fonts on the device.  You get slightly more
consistent appearance that way.

Completely flexible sizing for symbols is obviously pretty important
too and I will put it on my list.  In the meantime, here is a quick
function which you can use to draw circles.

    circles <- function(x, y, radius, col=NA, border=par("fg"))
    {
        nmax <- max(length(x), length(y))
        if (length(x) < nmax) x <- rep(x, length=nmax)
        if (length(y) < nmax) y <- rep(y, length=nmax)
        if (length(col) < nmax) col <- rep(col, length=nmax)
        if (length(border) < nmax) border <- rep(border, length=nmax)
        if (length(radius) < nmax) radius <- rep(radius, length=nmax)
        theta <- 2* pi * seq(0, 355, by=5) / 360
        ct <- cos(theta)
        st <- sin(theta)
        for(i in 1:nmax)
            polygon(x[i] + ct * xinch(radius[i]), y[i] + st * yinch(radius[i]),
                col=col[i], border=border[i])
    }


"x" and "y" give the coordinates of the centers of the circles,
"radius" gives the circle radius in inches, "col" gives a vector of
colors to fill the circles and "border" gives a vector of colors to
draw the borders.  Note that "col" and "border can both be set to NA.
Doing this respectively disables filling and border drawing.
(Shorter vectors are recycled according to the usual rule).

There are couple of problems to note.  If you resize a window, the
circles are resized (becoming ellipses).  If you use to dev.print() to
get hardcopy, you will probably end up with ellipses (unless you are
careful about preserving plot aspect ratios).  To get hardcopy start
the printing device by hand and redraw the plot.

A "real" implementation of circles (and similar shapes) should not
suffer from these problems.  I think I know how to do it, but don't
hold your breath.

Subject: [R] Survivors and bugs ...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990202101156.25069B-100000@mercury.quantex>

Two questions:

I have a lot of data for which the last of each of the repeated individual
obserations is censored.  Apart from the suite in survival, which seems to
be very complex to a new R user, is there any other simple function that
exists in CRAN library (I have most of these but haven't found one!) that
is essentially the same as lm() but with an additional censor argument
(vector of -1,0,1 say, recalling my GLIM background) so that the left,
uncensored or right censored data may be simply analysed. 

Obviously I could write my own fairly simply using nlm() and model frames
but just asking ... if I write my own, I can post it on the list. 

The second question relates to a few problems with glm() that have been
found today and recently (the offset problem) by Jim comparing with his
own glmm() function. I don't follow the r-bugs list (these things are too
depressing!) but are these bugs either serious, occasional or a result of
esoteric problems?  One would like to know since I don't have immediate
access to (say) S+ to see whether the results are the same (or the errors
reproduced).

Can anyone give me a slightly more explicit hint as to how

Before some people think this is a bug, there is nothing
pathological or undesirable in Jim's examples. First,
the deviance in the Bernoulli model (0-1 outcome) is
simply equal to 
     -2 log lik = -2 sum (y*log phat + (1-y)*log(1-phat) )
where phat is the estimated prob's from the model.

> y <- rbinom(20,1,0.5)
> ind <- rep(1,20)
> glm(y~1,family=binomial)
the null deviance here is the deviance of the model with constant
term, which the same as the full model, so the null-dev is the same
as the residual deviance. 

> glm(y~ind-1,family=binomial)
Here the null-model is logit p =0, so under this model phat=0.5,
and the null-dev has n degrees of freedom. If this is not a 
meaningful model, then make the constant model the null
model. The residual deviance is from the model with constant
term, so the same as the first case.

> glm(y~ind-1,family=binomial(link=log))
Here null-model is log p = 0, so phat = 1. The deviance 
formula then computes log (1-1)=Inf for null-dev.
Residual deviance  is from the model with constant
term, so the same as the first case.

> glm(y~ind-1,family=binomial(link=cloglog))
here the null model is log(-log(1-p))=0, so 
phat = 1- exp(-exp(0))= 0.63. Again, the
residual deviance  is from the model with constant
term, so the same as the first case.


Question to the devel:
       shouldn't the cloglog = log(-log(p))?
       rather than   log(-log(1-p)) as implemented?

Couldn't have put that better myself. 0-intercept models may of course
be irrelevant in specific situations but they are sometimes relevant,
and in those cases, you need the null deviance to test all regression
coefficients zero.

A matter of taste, of course (S-plus has the same as R here). I
believe the convention comes from survival analysis where cloglog of
the *death* probability in a given interval is linear under the
proportional hazards assumption.

The current implementation is consistent with  the other 
link functions for the binomial: 
     It is monotonely INcreasing

BTW: Try  
	   plot(function(p) log(-log(1-p)))

     if your R version is >= 0.63.2

No cloglog is an abbreviation for Complementary log - log.
The model emerges from gruped survival:

Suppose for the sake of the argument that the failure rate is
lambda and that objects are observed over an interval of length
1. Then the probability of failure is:
  
   p = 1 - exp(-lambda*1)

If you want to implement a proportional hazards model, the relvant
parameter from a linear poit of view is eta=log(lambda), hnce the model:
   
   p = 1 - exp(-exp(eta))
or
   log(-log(1-p)=eta

Hence the Complementary log-log.

If you want the other model just use:
    glm(1-y~x,family=binomial(link=cloglog))
and keep track og your signs!

No patch is needed, data.frame just doesn't work like that:

> df <- data.frame(y=cbind(rpois(20,4),rpois(20,4)),x=rnorm(20))
> names(df)
[1] "y.1" "y.2" "x"  

> df <- data.frame(y=I(cbind(rpois(20,4),rpois(20,4))),x=rnorm(20))
> names(df)
[1] "y" "x"

I.e. data.frame normally expands matrix arguments in their constituent
columns. This is so that data.frame(m) works "as expected" when m is a
matrix. (Of course you're free to expect otherwise...) If df has no
component named "y", glm() and friends won't find it.

Yes, but... How else would you do things like the following?

dfr<-data.frame(y=exp(rnorm(100)))
try<-seq(-2,2,.1)+0.01
rss<-sapply(try,
    function(lambda)
	summary(lm((y^lambda - 1)/lambda ~ 1,dfr))$sigma
)
plot(try,rss)

I would like to force a specific variable to always be the first split criterion
in rpart, somewhat analagous to forcing a variable into a stepwise regression. I
looked in V & R, and in the help files for the rpart package. If it's there,
it's pretty well hidden. Can anyone help me with this?

A change in deviance is typically meaningful, so in general we want the
null deviance too. In the following example:
> y_ rbinom(20,1,.8)
> sum(y)
[1] 15
> ind_ rep(1,20)
> glm(y~ind-1,family=binomial)

Call:  glm(formula = y ~ ind - 1, family = binomial) 

Coefficients:
  ind  
1.099  

Degrees of Freedom: 20 Total (i.e. Null);  19 Residual
Null Deviance:      27.73 
Residual Deviance: 22.49        AIC: 24.49 
> 1-pchisq(27.73-22.49,1)   # testing H_0: logit p=0 or p=0.5
[1] 0.02207327             # it'd be annoying to know null-deviance


> dbinom(15,20,.5) + 2*sum(dbinom(16:20,20,.5))
[1] 0.0266037           # mid-p value is closest to chi^2-based p-val.
> binom.test(15,20,.5)
number of successes = 15, number of trials = 20, p-value = 0.04139 
   # this is 'exact' 2-sided p-value, it's
   # not necessarily 'better' than mid-p value above.

I know Jim knows all this stuff inside out, so maybe there is
some miscommunication here.

Subject: [R] Eyeball problem ...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990203132841.25069G-100000@mercury.quantex>

Just a point about plotting and abline with a dotted grid.  Try this for
size: 

eh<-function (mx, my, line='dotted') 
{
    x <- c(0, mx)
    y <- c(0, my)
    plot(x, y, "l")
    abline(v = seq(0, mx, 10), h = seq(0, my, 10), lty = line)
}

eh(100,100)
eh(100,1000)
eh(100,5000)
eh(100,10000)

When there are enough horizontal lines, the dotted characteristic makes it
look vertical!  Had me puzzled for a bit.  Try it with line='' as well. 
Actually it is worse with (eg) eh(10000,100) but I was considering your
collective health.

Is there any simple way of returning the axis label values that can be
passed to abline, or enforcing abline to put the grid against these?  This
is what I was actually trying to do when my eyeballs fell out.

  For what it's worth, *if* you have the luxury of a color medium (such as
a screen) this looks much better (in my opinion at least) if you make the
grid lines solid and grey, rather than dotted and black, which eliminates
all the funky dot-pattern-aliasing stuff (a tip from Edward Tufte)

  More poking around identifies (under "?par")

    tck: The length of tick marks as a fraction of the
          smaller of the width or height of the plotting
          region.  If `tck=1', grid lines are drawn. The
          default setting is to use `tcl=-0.5' (see below).
 
  If we had a col.tick  (and possibly a lty.tick) parameter as well that
would provide a bit more flexibility for plotting grids ...

This seems a good idea to add to the elastic wish list for graphics -
and/or a grid= option (default F) with a col.grid and lty.grid parameter.

I hadn't spotted this but you can't control the grid line so I will
continue with abline for the mo'.

Sorry for the eyestrain folks.

No, definitely, not.

Most things that have been (and should be) reported to R-bugs
are NOT important bugs.

* Some are not bugs at all
     - because the sender was mistaken
  or
     - because it's really a matter of taste

* Some really happen only rarely, 
  and give error messages that are clear enough, 
  such that a user will `program around', etc.
* Some (e.g. UseMethod/ scoping rules / eval / substitute)  really are
  for more sophisticated R users  whereas R-help usually has a more general
  (applied) statisticians' audience.
  
* Documentations  typos, ...  *are* bugs [see the R-FAQ];
  you help the R community a lot by reporting them, and we do fix them
  (sometimes only eventually).
  However, almost always they are not of much relevance to the R user, 
  and shouldn't be reported to R-help.

-------

If important bugs are found, 
they should be reported to R-help.
I think however, that we haven't seen many of them in the last
months (years?), and *did* report them (mostly?).

And:  People who are actively developing R software (e.g. package writers)
      should really be subscribed to R-devel.

R-help is primarily intended for helping people use R, whereas R-devel
is for people actively engaged in developing it. I wouldn't expect
everyone on r-help to be interested in seeing every little quirk that
gets registered on r-bugs.

Of course, it can be warranted to announce bugs on r-help (or even
r-announce if they are bad enough), but I don't think it's the general
case. 

And - not to put too fine a point on it - I think that one needs to
distinguish between actual bug reports, overall design discussions,
and lack of knowledge about how things really work, rather than just
send everything to r-bugs with a Cc: to r-help.

Is it possible to get

- axis labels (x, y, z)
on a persp plot? If so, please tell me how.  If not, it would be nice to
be able to do it! (At a minimum the ticks; if nec I could do the rest by
hand with tgif after pstoediting the .ps file created by R)

I am using version 63.0. (Maybe I just need to upgrade)

Thanks very much for any help.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990208165210.1406A-100000@mercury.quantex>

Hi

Apart from nlm() with the stepmax= argument, is there any other >1
dimensional minimisation function where I can limit the step size
dynamically.  With the NAG routine E04NBF (I think)  I used to bound the
size of the next step using a*arctan(x/a) tricks where a function was
particularly difficult near a boundary and thus 'steer' the result within
legal limits.

The function I am trying to minimise is (negative) log likelihood for the
GEV but with a *lot* of right-censoring.  I am not currently sure whether
it is a numerical problem (it could well) but I would like to explore
any other optimiser if there is one in the many libraries.

Adrian:

We are unable to compile this software on either platform. I don't think
there is anything more we can do at this time. 

Here are several options for the future:

1) If you know of anyone who has successfully compiled this software on
   either DEC Alpha (running Dunix 4.0) or on a 64 bit SGI (running Irix 6.2)
   then maybe they would share their work with us.

2) We can watch for future versions of the software. A newer version may
   fix the comilation problems.

3) Maybe you have a grad student who knows Fortran who could work on the
   code?

that's all for now,
rcf

I attached my "config.site" file. I am using it with R 0.63.2 on my Alphas
(DU 4.0E) with no problems during compiling. It contains the needed
fortran and ld options. You have to do only a "./configure" and "make".

I hope this helps. 

BTW, there are binary packages available at our ftp server 

  ftp://ftp.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/uni-klu.ac.at/rpms/osf1/alpha/

but currently they are not up to date, and because these packages are in
RPM format you would first need to install rpm 2.5 and some basic freeware
rpm packages for DU 4.0. (These are Digital Unix (4.0) RPMs and no
Linux/Alpha RPMs!)

I'm not sure what you mean by `robust', precisely, but one of

cov.trob in package MASS in the VR bundle

cov.rob  in package lqs (part of the pre-release of 0.63.3) and
also available as an add-on package in the Windows collection and at
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R

will probably do what you want.  

Robustness for a multivariate problem has several definitions; cov.trob has
high efficiency near the normal, cob.rob has high breakdown point.  For
those familiar with S-PLUS, cov.rob supersedes cov.mve and cov.mcd (and was
written to replace those in V&R3), and has wrappers to emulate them.

Someone on this list gave me the hint to try f2c and DEC's cc to compile
under DU (I don't have fortran on the dec).  I have done this and R
compiles on my Alpha. The f2c combination and gcc did NOT work on the
alpha.

I wish I could thank that person but I cleaned up my desk!!!

Subject: [R] problems with read.table
Message-ID: <199902100906.KAA03235@aryness.ethz.ch>

Dear R users,
I have the following problem:
I have a table in ASCII-format, separated with commas. I can read it as
long as no field contains a comma itself. If one does, read.table doesn't
function even though that field is double-quoted.

Ex.:

File "test.csv":

Name,Strasse,PLZ
Jsaac,Gossauerstrassee 29,9100
Roth-Bernasconi,"20, ch. des Fauvettes",1212


adressen <- read.table("test.csv", header=T, sep=",")

results in an error as the comma in "20, ch. des Fauvettes" is interpreted
as a field delimiter. Playing around with read.table and also with scan I
found out that double-quotes are always interpreted as characters of their
own.

What can I do? Thanks for any help.

Peter

One possibility:
Change the last line to

	   Roth-Bernasconi,20\, ch. des Fauvettes,1212
			     ^^
i.e., espape the "," (and don't use the " double quotes).

However, this is not always a feasible solution.

Message-ID: <36C169E8.3FB6BE96@ozemail.com.au>

Josef,

One easy way is to use "read.table" to create a data frame.  For
example, if you have an ASCII file of the following format:

subject,sex,height,weight,age
001,M,183,72,53
002,F,167,55,28
...

called "people.dat" you can create a data frame object with the command

people.df<-read.table("people.dat",header=T,sep=",")

see read.table in the help pages.

Jim

I've "compiled" R on an OSF1 alpha and on Irix 6.2 and 6.5 (R4000):

The Irix 6.2 system is a mess due to the number of patches that have
been applied, reversed, etc.  Some headers are just missing and had to
be copied from another system into "/usr/local/include.bugs".

On the Irix 6.5 system, there were some name clashes which required
additions to the "SGI nonsense" section of src/include/Mathlib.h:

---------------------------
  
There are problems with both the OSF1 and Irix 6.5 versions.  In both
cases I used the vendor's compilers.  Both these systems are very fresh,
out of the box installations with no patches applied.  SGI provides perl
5, but OSF1 (at least with the options installed on the system available
to me) does not, so I don't get documentation on OSF1.  Furthermore, tick
marks and some other lines (e.g., in boxplots) are missing from plots when
I use the x11 device, but present using the PS device.

The SGI version gives:

> demo(lm.glm)
[...]
> anova(lmwg <- lm(weight ~ group))
Analysis of Variance Table

Response: weight
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
Error: names attribute must be the same length as the vector

I made more headway using Irix 6.2 and GNU compilers, but had to use GNU
rx instead of the SGI regcomp routines, which gave:

> gsub("([ab])", "\\1_\\1_", "abc and ABC")
Error: invalid backreference in regular expression

Finally, I want to use the cluster package, but the "daisy" function
fails on a simple example for:

> codes(as.ordered(NULL))
Error: no applicable method for "codes"

Is this a bug or a change in the definition of "codes"?

A bug in ordered(), if any. Probably the first bit of that should read

    if (length(x) == 0) 
        return(structure(numeric(0), 
		class=c(if(ordered)"ordered","factor")))

rather than return(character(0)).

You could have guessed, but that's easy to say if one knows it....

Try 
   plot(1,type='n'); text(1,1, expression(sum(x[i], i==1, n)  == y[k[n]]))

The help page  "?text"  has a few more examples.

try

residuals(glm(...))
predict(glm(...))

Both give want you want as default. (Check the residuals.glm and
fitted.glm help pages).

Subject: [R] Installing on DEC 4.0b Alpha Server 2100A

Greetings,

I am trying to install R (0.63.2) on a Digital Unix 4.0b 
Alpha Server 2100A using gcc 2.8.1 and f77 v 0.5.2.3.  It 
seems to compile OK.  However, when I try to run R I get 
the following message:

R : Copyright 1999, The R Development Core Team

Type   "demo()" for some demos, "help()" for on-line help, or
       "help.start()" for a HTML browser interface to help.
Type   "q()" to quit R.
 
Floating exception

Any thoughts on what the problem ("FLOATING 
EXCEPTION") might be would be helpful. I am slightly 
suspect of the fortran compiler but can not say for certain 
that it is the problem.  Many thanks in advance.

This is the same problem I had with the same gcc 2.8.1 and f77
combination.  R would compile but wouldn't run without problems.  What
finally worked for me was f2c (I don't have Dec's fortran) and DEC's cc.

I set the c compiler to cc by typing
CC=cc
export CC

and run configure with 

./configure --with-f2c

Reading the list has prompted me to try installing R on one of our Alpha's
once again. The end product of all the suggestions is the following when I
try make

../../aux/GETSYMBOLS
mkdir ../../include
Make: Unrecognized modifier ';  ls COPYRIGHT COPYRIGHT.ftn Makefile.in
ROUTINES *.[cfh]'.  Stop.
*** Exit 1
Stop.
*** Exit 1
Stop.


My collegues here say the best option is to try and get R set up our our
SUN (Solaris) but guess what I can't do that either. Has anyone any
suggestions as to  where I should start. I am happy to try and increase my
UNIX background - that would'nt be difficult.

Any pointers welcomed!

I don't know how well it is documented, but you need gnu make.  OK,
everybody knows that.  But it has to called make.  And it has to be the
make that gets run when you type 'make'.

I have both dec's make and gnu make on my alpha, but gnu's make is called
gnumake.  I tried typing 'gnumake' to make R.  Not good enuf.  I had to
name it make, and make sure it was found (play with path stuff) before
dec's make.  Or temporarily rename the dec make into something else.

I'm not exactly sure, but I think it might work to set the environment
explicitly, i.e.

MAKE=gnumake gnumake # /bin/sh syntax

or

setenv MAKE gnumake # /bin/csh
gnumake

It definitely does work to add
MAKE=gnumake
to config.site (before calling configure).  Then you don't need to
remember this again.

I think the variable is needed to be set at configure time, not just
make time.

Subject: [R] Fisher's Exact Test
Message-ID: <9902129188.AA918849917@ccmail.hgsi.com>

Appology in advance if this has been asked and answered. I am getting different
answers using Fisher's exact test in the package ctest. For example:
x_cbind(c(8, 22), c(31, 29))
fisher.test(x)

    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data 

data:  x 
p-value = 0.04024 
alternative hypothesis: two.sided 

However, in SAS or other packages on the net the answer I get is p-value=
0.02664.

Is this a result of the Clarkson, Fan & Joe (1993) improvement or am I doing
something fundamentally wrong?
(the above is only an example - I get different (from R) answers when I use 
different input matrices).

TIA.

With the most recent ctest, I actually get

> fisher.test(x)

         Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data 

data:  x 
p-value = 0.02664 
alternative hypothesis: two.sided 

The confusion is caused by this:

> fisher.test(x,alt="l")

         Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data 

data:  x 
p-value = 0.02012 
alternative hypothesis: less 


So the old definition of the p-value is 2 * (one-sided p), whereas the
new one sums those point probabilities that are less than or equal to
the observed one. 

Mind you, there's a paper by Yates lying somewhere in my "must read
some time" stack where he argues that the 2 * p procedure is more
correct...

If you use fort77 you need to remove the -export-dynamic flag. This can be
done by uncommenting the LDFLAGS section of config.site and putting in
only the other necessary flags (probably none) and reconfiguring.

You can also edit the -export-dynamic out of the LDFLAGS line in Makeconf
and etc/Makeconf instead of rerunning configure, but this isn't
recommended.

In many ways the best solution is to install the egcs compiler which
includes gcc and g77. It is certainly in Red Hat 5.2, and may be in Red
Hat 5.0.

Subject: [R] .Rdata questions
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990215084531.387A-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

in a current project I have a pretty huge .Rdata. Thus I was working with
R --vsize 100 --nsize 1000000. Today when I tried to restart R I get the
following error message:

Error: a read error occured
Fatal error: unable to restore saved data
 (remove .RData or increase memory)

I increased memory up to --vsize 180 and --nsize 2000000, but the error
reoccurrs. Is there a way to know whether this error results from a
corrupt .Rdata or whether it is really a question of memory?

And, are there good strategies for not loosing big .Rdata (except for
backups between sessions and regular save.image() within sessions) ?

That is, I guess, one of the few things I prefer in S-plus: firstly, there
is no big file containing all the objects, but the objects are in a
directory .Data (so they can be managed there and if an object is
corrupted you don't loose all your objects) and secondly, that every
object is saved as soon as it is created.

I am mostly working with ESS and it happened to me that after q () I quit
emacs too quickly and lost an .Rdata and some other time I did an C-x k on
the R buffer (which is, admittedly, pretty stupid). Are there ways to get
emacs to need a confirmation if one is trying to kill an active buffer
(well, actually, it needs one normally, doesn't it)? 

Thanks for any help and/or pointers!

Probably Kurt Hornik, the author of this package, will have already
replied to this. The ctest package has indeed been recently updated (and
a bug was fixed in the windows binary to boot). Though not immediately
an R question, I wanted to comment on Peter's

>Mind you, there's a paper by Yates lying somewhere in my "must read
>some time" stack where he argues that the 2 * p procedure is more
>correct...

which becomes an R question if your think that there is such a thing as
Kurt's package being "correct". Try this definition of a P value: the
probability, under the null hypothesis, of observing data as, or more,
extreme than that actually observed. If you buy this frequently
quoted/paraphrased definition, and I suggest most people would, then you
should go with latest version of ctest, i.e. summing the probabilities
of all tables with probability of occurrence less than or equal to the
probability of that observed (under the null hypothesis). BUT if you
want your P value to be such that in the long run your type I error is
exactly what you quote, then you use the double-one-sided P. (Actually
you should use double-one-sided-MID-P to get even closer to stated type
I error asymptotically overall, though for certain null hypothesis
values you then sometimes under-quote.)

I ended up suggesting to Kurt that if he finds himself with masses of
spare time on his hands (yes, joke) he include all these via options
since some people get quite passionate about which one is "correct". The
idea of a P value is to quantify to what extent the data are
"consistent" with the null which begs the question of what we mean by
"consistent" (that's according to Cox and Hinkley, anyway). I reckon if
one procedure gave you "significance" and another didn't, you wouldn't
have strongly established the result under anybody's definitions.

Subject: [R] can't find functions?
Message-ID: <36C7FE2F.57197A57@esb.ucp.pt>


Dear all,

I have recently installed R0.63.2. under Win95. and with it a number of
contributed packages. The instructions for adding packages was to unzip
the files into the "directory rw0632\library. They are then available
for use."

However, when I tried one of the function below, I got a Error: couldn't
find function "cclust".


x<-rbind(matrix(rnorm(100,sd=0.3),ncol=2),
matrix(rnorm(100,mean=1,sd=0.3),ncol=2))
cl<-cclust(x,2,20,verbose=TRUE,method="kmeans")
Error: couldn't find function "cclust"
 plot(cl,x)
Error: Object "cl" not found

This happened with all contributed packages I added to both R0.63.1 and
R0.63.2.
Any suggestions?

Also, I tried to update the html help using  make.packages.html() and
got the following:

> make.packages.html()
1:

Can anyone tell me what do I type next? In R0.63.1 this does not happen
and the help files are updated without a problem.

Yes.  There is also the "tail balance" version, i.e. you look in the opposite
tail for all the cases which have *tail* probability less than that
observed. I tend to like this one because of the difficulty with
distributions like the following

0  0.02
1  0.05
2  0.10
...
7  0.019
8  0.015
9  0.010
10 0.008

i.e. P(X<=0) = 0.02 P(X>=7) = 0.052  --- is 7 really as extreme as 0? 

Fortunately, none of the standard distributions are as nasty as that,
but conceptually there's a problem. The tail-balance method would only
count 9 and 10 as more extreme as 0, which I feel is much better,
although it unfortunately doesn't generalise to several dimensions
like the point probability method does.

Actually, the old fisher.test *tried* to do this, but had a bug,
causing it to sum the same tail twice... 

BTW: The reference for Yates' paper is JRSS A(1984), 426--463 (incl.
discussion). In particular the discussion section is full of
"quotation value", e.g. Finney:

"We should be grateful to Dr Yates for his characteristically
realistic account of matters that in recent years others have tended
to make increasingly obscure."

`available for use' means that you may use the _package_, with
`library': it does not mean that the package contents are available for
use.

library(clust)
cl<-cclust(x,2,20,verbose=TRUE,method="kmeans")

Incidentally, if this is what you want to do, use

library(mva)

and use kmeans() instead.

Subject: [R] Ca't run R on NT4
Message-ID: <0846B011B9A4D111A1EE006097DA4FCEE7C2C5@icex1.cc.ic.ac.uk>

I'm using NT 4, service pack 3, and running rjune.exe, dated 23/9/98.

This works fine when I'm logged in as administrator, but when a user logs
in, R fails with the message 'memory problem'.

I assume that R needs (write?) access to something to which our user
accounts don't normally have access. I tried giving the account full access
to the R directory tree but that didn't help. I also looked to see whether R
was making temporary files somewhere while using it as administrator, but
that didn't seem to be the case

Can anyone suggest what the problem might be?

Thanks in advance, and apologising if this is a FAQ - I did try to look
through the archive!

No doubt this list is not where the Meaning Of Statistics should be
discussed, but I'd like to comment -- with the excuse that I shall veer
the comment towards R anyway.

1. Choice of test statistic is in principle arbitrary in the first
instance. Once chosen, it defines a "measure of discrepancy" (or
"consistency" if you will) between data and hypothesis. The
"P-value", in this context, is simply a standardised universal
measurement scale into which the value of the statistic can be mapped.

2. If a well-defined alternative hypothesis is available, usually
this can serve to determine a good statistic, since the alternative
highlights the "direction" in which you should measure discrepancy
(and often implies *how* you should measure it).

3. In the absence of (2), choice of statistic as in (1) implies a
class of alternatives such that hypotheses in this class have higher
likelihood than the Null for data which are discrepant according to
the chosen test statistic. The emergence of this class of alternatives,
as a result of the test procedure, can suggest directions for future
research.

So it's all up for grabs, in general; the logical framework implied by
the above is flexible and elastic and allows scope for tailoring the test
to the needs of the application. This is the point at which you need to
think about reality. One test may give "significance", another not. If
reality has suggested an appropriate test -- as in (2) above -- that is
the one whose outcome you should favour. Otherwise, the difference
between the outcomes can tell you something about the reality you don't
yet understand well enough -- see (3) above.

The implications for any general-purpose package (such as R) are that
ideally the package should be able to support the statistician in
whatever [s]he decides is appropriate, for exploration or for final
testing, in the context of the research being carried out.

In particular this means that the investigation should not be driven by
the limitations of software. R and its ilk possess the basic mechanisms,
accessible to the user, to allow infinite flexibility of use. Certain
distinguished users, such as Peter Dalgaard, develop procedures on top of
these mechanisms which are of great use to the rest of us. The more
options they are willing to build in to these procedures, the more scope
the rest of us will have when we use them (and we'll be very grateful for
it too). So I'm emphatically *pro* flexible options, and *anti*
restriction of choice on grounds of spurious "correctness".

Simon's reference to Cox & Hinckley is very much to the point. See e.g.
Ch3, p. 65: "It is ... necessary to have also some idea of the type of
departure from the null hypothesis which it is required to test. All sets
of data are uniquely extreme in some respects and without some idea of
what are meaningful departures from H_0 the problem of testing
consistenecy with it is meaningless."

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Thanks. I'm very happy to acknowledge this and apologise for the

Kurt Hornik is a splendid contributor, and not just to R -- I also
value his many contributions to the "octave" package.

I have no direct answer to Lorenz's problem.

On a related note, though, I was unable to "source" a large matrix that I
had "dumped".  I kept running out of cons memory (the maximum of which
seems to be 1000000).  When I recalculated the matrix and used write to
create a file, thought, I was able to read it in using read.table.  I hope
this saves someone the frustration of having to discover that.

A complex "solve" would not be difficult to add.  It just requires
incorporating a few more linpack routines.  Is "solve" sufficient, or
is there additional facilities you might want?

Yes. A complex matrix C= A+Bi  is isomorphic (w.r.t. multiplication)
 to a real matrix R defined as
      R =  A -B
              B  A
(Note the minus sign on the NE side). To solve(C) you can solve(R) and
get the appropriate sections. Ref: N.R. Goodman(1963) Ann. Math. Stat.

Subject: [R] Fisher's Exact Test
Message-ID: <0F78008FGQJH22@hermes.ucd.ie>

This is a statistical comment, not R, but I think it'd be of
interest to some in the group.

There have been many thoughtful comments on this topic,
though none is likely to 'solve' the problem of 2-sided P-value
for asymmetric distribution. I find the issue theoretically
embarassing: for any definition you can come up with
a simple uncontrived bothersome example. For what's worth,
there is a paper of mine (jointly with A.Dunne) on 2-sided 
P-value based on the UMPU tests: Statistician, 1996, 397-405. 
**I'm not suggesting we use it in practice though.**

Yates corrected Chi-square for 2x2 table corresponds to
doubling 1-sided p-value, a method that appeared to be
endorsed by Fisher in 1941 (quoted in Yates-1984), though
unfortunately Fisher didn't seem to think very hard on this
issue.

I agree with Simon Fear that for 1-dimensional parameters 
the mid-P-value method is probably most sensible. For
multi-dimensional problems summing the prob's less than
the observed is the most practical, though it would corres-
pond to a biased test.

The lack of resolution probably means there's something
wrong with the idea of 2-sided P-value. (Bayesians say so
for any P-value). At some point we should probably
switch to something like likelihood ratio (and AIC for
multi-dimensional problems).

 <Pine.OSF.4.00.9902111914330.6774-100000@alpha5-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at>
Message-ID: <Pine.NXT.4.05.9902151638360.16017-100000@bodnext.bio.dfo.ca>

On some systems (alpha), tick marks don't appear on plots.  The easiest
way to see the problem is something like:

> plot(0:1,axes=FALSE)
> axis(1,1:2)

The problem is in X11_Line(...) from .../src/unix/devX11.c, which is
so short I've included the whole function below:

static void X11_Line(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2,
                     int coords, DevDesc *dd)
{
    double xx1, yy1, xx2, yy2;              <----------- should be int!
    x11Desc *xd = (x11Desc *) dd->deviceSpecific;

    /* In-place conversion ok */

    GConvert(&x1, &y1, coords, DEVICE, dd);
    GConvert(&x2, &y2, coords, DEVICE, dd);
    xx1 = (int) x1;
    yy1 = (int) y1;
    xx2 = (int) x2;
    yy2 = (int) y2;

    SetColor(dd->gp.col, dd);
    SetLinetype(dd->gp.lty, dd->gp.lwd, dd);
    XDrawLine(display, xd->window, xd->wgc, xx1, yy1, xx2, yy2);
    XSync(display, 0);
}

Indeedy.. Fixed for 0.63.3. However, I believe that this points to an
include file problem, because if the XDrawLine call had been properly
prototyped, all that should happen is a silly double->int->double->int
coercion maneuver.

I agree with the definition. But IMHO, I think the extremeness should be
defined in the likelihood ratio

sup Lik(Ho)(x) / sup Lik(Ha)(x)     is the measure of 
extremeness of the observation x, the smaller the more extreme.

Because an observation have small probability under Ho cannot be thought
of as extreme if the same probability under Ha is even smaller, 
(think of cont. case or near cont. case) instead it supports Ho.

I also like the idea of having an option in the R function for
two sided P-value, since there seems to be several competing
definitions.

Probably that it cannot find the base package... this is supposed to
be in  rw0632/library/base/r/base .

Did you use an extractor which preserves directory structure?

Peter,
thanks for your nearly immediate reply. I think, everything is in the right
place.
I thought, I missed something very simple that is not obvious to a new user.
For example, there is a directory library\base\r, may be it should read
library\base\R? This case sensitivity problem is not uncommon with NT.

This is a minor question, but is there any difference between the two
objects

fred <- structure(1:10, dim = c(2,5))

and

fred <- structure(1:10, .Dim = c(2,5))

Should I be using one rather than the other?  Thanks, Jonathan.

No:

R> dput(structure(1:10, dim = c(2,5)))
structure(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), .Dim = c(2, 5))

> Should I be using one rather than the other?  Thanks, Jonathan.

I think the dim= form is marginally better. .Dim gets internally
converted to dim anyway. (But don't ask me why dput represents it
using .Dim...)

With the most recent ctest, I actually get

> fisher.test(x)

         Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

data:  x
p-value = 0.02664
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

The confusion is caused by this:

> fisher.test(x,alt="l")

         Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

data:  x
p-value = 0.02012
alternative hypothesis: less


So the old definition of the p-value is 2 * (one-sided p), whereas the new one
sums those point probabilities that are less than or equal to the observed one.

Mind you, there's a paper by Yates lying somewhere in my "must read some time"
stack where he argues that the 2 * p procedure is more correct...

Message-ID: <36CAF75F.73CE3AD9@durham.ac.uk>

Dear R users,

That's probably a silly question even for a newbie but :

Is it possible to assign variable prices as variable names ?
For instance, would something like the following work :

for (i in 1:4)
{
 error.i <- some_calculation
}

so "error.i" variables would be created for i=1,2,3,4
i.e.  error.1 error.2 error.3 etc. etc.

Yes. Look at the help page for assign(). Whether it is ever better
than using arrays or lists is questionable, though.

   Dear R users,

   That's probably a silly question even for a newbie but :

   Is it possible to assign variable prices as variable names ?
   For instance, would something like the following work :

   for (i in 1:4)
   {
    error.i <- some_calculation
   }

   so "error.i" variables would be created for i=1,2,3,4
   i.e.  error.1 error.2 error.3 etc. etc.

It's possible but difficult and probably not what you want.

You can do something like
 assign(paste("error",i,sep="."),some.calculation)

but it's much easier to use a vector:

error<-numeric(4)
for (i in 1:4) {
	error[i]<-some.calculation
  }

The .Dim= form exists so that R and S can exchange data -- I think
think this dates back to ``old S'' (i.e. early '80s S) data
structures.  I think the dim= form works just as well, it is just
not what S produced when dput was written.

                Thomas Lumley

Their replies helped me to reach the following solution:
(I am utilizing the WaveThresh library and my aim was
to capture the result of different threshold policies).

for (i in 1:4)
{

temp<-ftallsh[1:8192]-wr(threshold(wd(ftallsh[1:8192],filter.number=i)))

  temp2<-paste("error",i,sep=".")
  assign(temp2, temp)
}

May I suggest that it is much safer not to use structure at all?

array(1:10, dim = c(2,5))
matrix(1:10, 2, 5)

are much higher-level, and do not depend on representations. I think
structure should only be used in `new' functions for classes.  This may
seem purist (it is), but when S4 came along (in S-PLUS 5) the purist code
continued to work, and quite a lot of the low-level code needed to be
changed. Perhaps one day matrices and arrays will acquire classes in R,
and then structure(1:10, dim = c(2,5)) will not be a matrix, which is
presumably what you want it to be.

It should read library\base\R but this does not matter on any NT system I
have ever used. If you have case sensitivity turned on for your file
system (most unusual, causes lots of problems) do try altering r to R in
rw0632/library/*.  It happens to be r in the zip file because of the way
Guido packed it, on an insensitive system.

(We use Unix file systems mounted by samba, on which all file names get
mapped to lowercase: Windows explorer seems to change case as it see fit.)

R 0.63.2, compiled using SGI cc and f90 on Irix 6.5 gives:

The above functions work correctly for R compiled with gcc and g77 on an
Irix 6.2 system.  The Irix 6.5 release notes explain that the test
(x!=x) will be compiled to "false" unless the command line option:

-OPT:IEEE_NaN_inf=ON

is supplied for the SGI compilers.

Subject: [R] Suggestion - an article about R in Linux Journal 
Message-ID: <36CB38E3.73CD@ibm.net>

I don't know if this has already been done, but anyway ... 

 I'm hooked on R (and I'm only a newbie ... :-) . Would it be a good
idea
 to have an introductory article about R in Linux Journal?  I'm
half-tempted
 to look at doing one myself, but I have a suspicion that such a thing
would
 not be "the done thing" for a newbie ....:-)  

 I've seen intro articles on Yorick and Icon in LJ, and I was
immediately 
 curious enough to download them and give them a go. 

 I'm just very keen to let others know about this wonderful package, and
it 
 would seem a good way to get a good number of new faces "hacking away"
and 
 helping out.  

 Has an article on R already appeared in (recent) LJ issues, and if not
- is 
 there any particular reason?  I look forward to your replies ... :-)

Er? Does that help? Since we rely on (from Arith.h)

#define ISNAN(x)                ((x)!=(x))

all over the place, it's not surprising that it won't work if it
compiles to false. (What kind of standards compliance is that
anyway?!)

The problem with NTFS in standard mode is that it keeps case but does not
honor it. This is fine if a program just hands file names over to the C
runtime but this means trouble if the program does its own file name
comparisons. The additional problems caused by the Win95 style explorer that
assigns upper or lower cases to the file name letters only cause further
confusion.
Meddling with the file names had no effect on the error message.
I did not look at the R source code until know, but it seems to be time for
a rebuild from the sources to do some bug hunting.

The configure script should probably try to determine if ((x)!=(x))
is working properly with the chosen compiler flags.  Even for the
(minority of) users who know what flags to use, it is all too easy to
forget to add the necessary incantations in config.site.  

For some environments, floating point configuration can be changed by
factors external to the application (e.g., DLL versions or environment
flags). To detect this, it would be useful to include a check for proper
functioning of isnan in the startup code.

In defense of SGI, the new compilers offer lots of scope for users to use
or ignore IEEE 754, including environment variables that can enable
trapping various f.p. exceptions, count the number of exceptions, and
trigger an abort after some number of exceptions.  This is a lot more
useful for people running "tradtional" scientific Fortran codes than
getting files full of NaN's.  I'm sure the default settings were chosen to
make common benchmark tests look good, as such results are still a big
factor in some purchasing decisions.

Subject: [R] Loading C++ libraries
Message-ID: <36CC1349.9EDDBA48@wu-wien.ac.at>

Some time ago, I asked on this list, if it is possible to use C++
libraries
under R. In fact this seems to be very easy (at least under Redhat 5.2,
egcs C++):

e.g.
Suppose we have a library

R_main.cc:
-------------------------------
#include "X.hh"

extern "C" {

void R_main ()
{
  X x;
}

}
-------------------------------
X.hh
-------------------------------
class X
{
public:
  X ();
  ~X ();
};

class Y
{
public:
  Y ();
  ~Y ();
};
-------------------------------
X.cc:
-------------------------------
#include <iostream.h>
#include "X.hh"

static Y y;

X::X()
{
  cout << "constructor X" << endl;
}

X::~X()
{
  cout << "destructor X" << endl;
}

Y::Y()
{
  cout << "constructor Y" << endl;
}

Y::~Y()
{
  cout << "destructor Y" << endl;
}
--------------------------------
Compiled and linked by

45: g++ -c X.cc
46: g++ -c R_main.cc
47: g++ -shared -o X.so R_main.o X.o

Now starting R yields

R : Copyright 1999, The R Development Core Team
Version 0.63.2  (January 12, 1999)
...
Type    "q()" to quit R.

>dyn.load("X.so")
constructor Y
>.C("R_main")
constructor X
destructor X
> q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: y
destructor Y
...

However linking has to be done with g++, since with the gnu ld

ld -shared -o X.so R_main.o X.o

__main() and hence, the constructor of the static variable Y are not
called.

Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.19990218133755.007d14a0@graylab.ac.uk>


Dear All,

R keeps crashing when I use fisher.test . I'm using it on 2 x c (where c
varies from 2 to 7) table, the total number of counts is 918. It does work
with some of the categorisations of the data, but it's failing on those
categorisations where the Chi-squared approximation breaks down due to
small expected counts. A conglomeration of categories is not feasible.  

Is my memory too small ( if so which one of the parameters nsize, vsize
needs changing) or do I need to change the parameter for 'working space'
within the command? Or is it soemthing else?

yours gratefully,

Simon Bond.

An example where it crashes, and some indication of your system and
the version of ctest would be helpful....

In plot() I can get greek symbols into text items without trouble.
However, some of the same commands don't work as I would expect with
hist(). See the example below.

> plot(1:10, 2:11, xlab=expression(paste("scaled", rho)))

	---- works as expected, ie. prints the greek rho

Error: Object "rho" not found

        ---- for kicks I tried sigma, it also was not found

Surprisingly the following worked:
> hist(c(0,0,0,0,4,5,6,6,6,8), xlab=expression(paste("scaled", pi)))

        ---- works as expected, ie. prints the greek pi


Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get such expressions into
hist()?

First of all, I don't know where people are getting that paste()
construction from. The juxtaposion operator for plotting math is "*",
i.e. 

hist(c(0,0,0,0,4,5,6,6,6,8), xlab=expression("scaled "*rho))

Not that that works either... This is a bug, caused by the eval(xlab)
near the top of hist.default. That line is there for a reason which
escapes me for the moment, but if you completely omit the evaluation,
you get labeling with c(1,2,3,4,...) instead of the variable name, if
you do hist(x).

However, when passing an expression for a label, the eval() mucks
things up by trying to evaluate expressions that only make formal
sense. Replacing it with just plain

xlab

seems to work better. (and ditto for "main").

Simon,

if you're using Brian Ripley's Windoze-compiled libraries any older than
a couple of weeks, there was a symbol clash in the compiled code. Now
fixed, so just download a new copy of ctest from CRAN. I'm not sure the
new version got announced on the list (hence I now cc).

The use of "paste" comes from careful reading of the documentation:

> ?legend
[...]
     ex.cs1 <- expression(plain(sin) * phi,  paste("cos", phi))# 2 ways
     legend(-3, .9, ex.cs1, lty=1:2, col=2:3)

"paste" and "*" are both used in "?text" as well.

I might have checked....

Anyways, there's clearly a bug in the implementation of paste(), so
'*' should be used for now.

Specifically:

static BBOX RenderConcatenate(SEXP expr, int draw)
{
    BBOX bbox;
    int i, n;

    expr = CDR(expr);
    n = length(expr);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bbox = CombineBBoxes(bbox, RenderElement(CAR(expr), draw));
        if (i != n - 1)
        ....

starts with an uninitialised bbox, which looks unhealthy to me.

[I don't seem yet to have got the first reply in this chain, so I don't
know what came afeter `First of all'!]

That fails for me as well. The problem is something different: hist
contains eval(xlab), and eval(expression("scaled "*rho)) will fail unless
rho is present. This is why pi works: there is an object called pi.

I think

   if(missing(xlab)) eval(xlab)

in hist.default will fix this (and ditto for main); it does fix this
example. But I would like an explanation of why the eval is needed (it is)
here and not, say, in plot. There is something about R's evaluation
model that I just don't follow here.

No, and it has got upgraded to ctest_0.9-10 and then ctest_0.9-11 since. I
don't announce new versions (anymore than CRAN does). Simon F's advice is
very generally good: if you have a problem, do go and get the latest
version (and also check if the Windows port is the same version as the
code on CRAN, as I only check every couple of weeks).

There have been known problems with ctest_0.9-8 and with modreg in rw0632:
in each case the version now in the contrib section on CRAN solves those
problems.

I have done about 90% of this, but only thoroughly checked the functions I
wanted to use. Unless someone else has done more I will finish this off and
send it to CRAN in due course.

John: what functions did you want to use: I can check those and send you
what I have?

Is the following behaviour of tapply not disappointing?
Problem with tapply occurs when dealing with na.rm when an
argument additional to na.rm is sent to the applied function (here
quantile). 

Any comment?

Ick! This comes from the fact that the result of quantile is named, so
that unlist()'ing it gives names "1.60%", "2.60%", and as.numeric on
this gives.... The fix is to move the line 

index <- as.numeric(names(ans))

up before the if()-else construction.

Solved:
you have to give the full path name to the executable.
If you put \rw0632\bin on the DOS search path or change to this directory,
the library can not be located.

  This is very strange. Surely, it doesn't happens on our systems
  here. 
  Actually, library is located from RHOME and RHOME is 'computed'
  during the startup from the first argument of the main (which
  should contains the full name of the executable). It seems that
  this fails on your system. I will try to change this approch (if
  I remember there is a function in the Windows API to get the
  name of the current executable) but, in the meantime, please, could you
  check if R accepts the other command line arguments (since, and here,
  I don't see any other easy possibility, they are got from the
  other arguments of the main).

  g.

  (ps) A simple check is 
       (i) launch Rgui without anny arguments;
           in the console 
           > gc()
           note the Vcells number 
       (ii) invoke R using "yourpath\Rgui --vsize 12"
           in the console 
           > gc()
        Now, the Vcells should be different.

Subject: [R] mysql or java interface to R
Message-ID: <36CE8D36.4CDBDBB3@med.usyd.edu.au>

The data that I am analysing is stored in a mysql database on a linux
system.
I am currently extracting this data to a text file and then analysing it
with R. Is there
some way of implementing an interface to a remote database in R. Or
perhaps a
java interface that would allow JDBC access to mysql.


thanks

Richard Piper

Dear R users,

	I am trying to use the boot library to estimate confidence intervals
and i have found some problem. I am using 0.63.2 version in a linux machine
and i downloaded the latest version of the libraries from the CRAN site.
Unfortunately i cannot run the documentation example for boot.ci and as it
looks is some problem with the masking of the objects, but i might be missing
something. Is this a bug  or am i missing something? 

thanks in advance,

IOsu

P.D.: I add here the session log attempting to run the example from the
boot.ci documentation

Subject: [R] Size of objects in the workspace
Message-ID: <199902221650.IAA13372@desire.rt.cs.boeing.com>

Is there an easy way (or any way) to determine the size of all the 
objects in an R workspace.  I know that "dim" will work on matrices, 
"length" will work on lists, but what gives the size of a function?

After I have worked for a few days I often get confused about what is 
what in the workspace, so I'm looking for something like "ls -l", to 
point me toward the big memory hogs.

Thanks, --Mike

Subject: [R] rw0632 makes stray .Rhistory orphans
Message-ID: <000001be5f1c$ef0b70e0$6f1abb81@fenris>

If you start Rterm/Rgui from the cmd (NT4.4) command line, the .Rhistory and
.RData files are created/used in the current directory.
I think, R should honor HOME or even the USERPROFILE variable.

Regards
Karl

PS: is this the correct list for such reports or would it be better to use
r-devel?

  This is modelled on the Unix behaviour. About .RData, I strongly
  believe that it is a very sensible (and useful) behavior
  (I use different directories for different projects or data
   and WANT different .RData).
  About .RHistory is more a matter of taste. Probably, I agree
  that one .RHistory is enough.
  

  BTW, since we are speaking on .RHistory:  under Unix,
  I would like to have the command history saved 
  also when one doesn't save the workspace; now, exiting
  with q("no") or friends doesn't update .RHistory.

Dear Karl

I think this would not prove to be very useful.

You can specify the startup directory in the shortcut to Rgui or write a two 
line batch file for Rterm if you need to (eg in R.bat put cd DIRNAME; Rterm %1 
%2 ...). 

I don't understand why you would want to put all your data in one 
file/directory in the first place. The reason I use directories is so that I 
can do different jobs in different directories and so the current method is 
ideal.

Regards
Peter

I don't agree. I want the record to be per-project. S has an audit 
mechanism for each project, and .Rhistory is the nearest equivalent.
It is very helpful to be able to find out a year or more later what one
did on a particular project, possibly crucial.

I could point out that ESS inferior-R-mode does that whether you like
it or not. (There may be variable that turns it off, but I haven't
found it (nor looked for it).

There isn't (at least that I can recall).  Actually, the "preferred"
(at least by me) method of using ESS is to keep a buffer of the
commands, running in R-mode (or similar), and just dump and edit
line-by-line, using the send-current-line command (it has a real name
which escapes me now).  This allows you to avoid including typos in
your history, which sometimes is nice.

Then, write out the actual process buffer as a "running" transcript,
save your command file as the "history", etc...

(The current preferred philosophy states that "Emacs buffer contents
and file contents are the truth, and the .RData/.Data/_Data contents
are temporary manifestations of the truth, to be recreated from the
buffer/file contents as needed".  Like all philosophies, you are free
to roll your own).

best,

Subject: [R] DLL's
Message-ID: <0F7M004EON3NNF@hermes.ucd.ie>

I'm using Borland C++ for windows version 4.51 to export functions 
in a dll to R but i've encountered the following problems
--  R crashes when function has more than one parameter
--  Array subscripts in C++ code access wrong elements
--  dll is not portable to different computer .i.e R (dyn.load) will only  
    call the dll on the the machine the dll was compiled on

Does the dll need to be compiled on a particular version of C ??

I would appreciate the solution to these problem(s)  and/or perhaps 
an example of some C code.

This isn't exactly what you are looking for but I would recommend
trying Martin Maechler's "str" function on the objects in your
workspace.  It does not directly give the size of the object but it
does give a concise description of the type of object and an explicit
map of its structure.  This helps enormously in debugging functions
that work on complicated structures such as fitted model structures.

Well, it is that R has changed a lot since that _package_ was ported from
the boot library, and the package has functions designed to work around
functionality missing in R at the time.

You can (and should) delete sample() from boot/R/zzz.R and re-install.
You can also delete smooth.spline (now in package modreg) and
model.response from that file.  One reason for now reporting the masking is
so that you are altered to problems like this and can fix them yourself.

I will send an update to CRAN when I find time to check the current state
of this: boot is a big package and takes a long time to check out, and
checking ports of other people's code is not high on my priority list.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990224144600.13375B-100000@mercury.quantex>

Is there a reason why cook.distance(lm(model)) gives a different answer to
glm.diag(glm(model))$cook

glm.diag is in boot and the difference is a ratio of about 0.8.

Comparison with GLIM (the Gold Standard) shows that the lm() value is
right but the glm() value is wrong.  I can supply the data is you want -
the model was just a 3-level factor - no continuous variables at all.

Subject: [R] Compiling R on Sunos
Message-ID: <199902241524.JAA13549@sade.eco.utexas.edu>

I'm looking for some help in getting R to compile on Sunos.  We run a
collection of Sunos and Solaris machines in the department here.  I got
to compile on Solaris 2.5.1 using gcc 2.7.2.2.  On my Sunos 4.1.3 (and
I've tried it on Sunos 4.1.4 as well) machines, it crashes during the
compile.  I'm using gcc 2.8.1 on there.  It gets to this point:

gcc -g -O2 -I../include -I../../src/include  -c bessel_y.c -o bessel_y.o
gcc -g -O2 -I../include -I../../src/include  -c choose.c -o choose.o

Anyone have any hints on this?  Its particularly wanted on Sunos by a

  If you want a patch in the meantime (rather than getting the newest
release version), try using the following patch (in src/nmath).  (This
just hand-defines RAND_MAX and changes NULL to 0.) 

  It worked for me on release 0.63.1, SunOS 4.1.4.

  Both B. Ripley and I are 
  making available DLL's which don't seem to suffer of your
  first and third problem. However, none of these, if
  I remember,  has C++ code.
  Crashes are easy to obtain if you don't respect exactly
  the ".C calling convention", e.g., if your function think
  to receive a string and not a vector of strings. This
  could also explain second problem. But it is just an 
  hypothesis. If you want, try to reduce at the minimum
  your source (at the level of a small toy) then post it.

>

  In theory no. I have used dll's compiled with Visual C++ without
  problems. And I received some reports that lcc works well.
  However, most of the people are using the GNU copyleft
  egcs compiler. Surely, binaries at CRAN are made using 
  egcs.

  A basic example of dynamic loading (including call_[R,S]) is
  in  the demo/dynload directory of the source. Observe that
  the C dll calls routines in the main code which under 
  Windows is in R.dll. Hence, you need to link against
  R.dll (how depends upon the compiler, you have to
  generate an appropriate import library from the R.dll,
  on this point,   not specific to R but including examples of use of many
  different compilers, you can give a look to the Luke Tierney's
  http://stat.umn.edu/~luke/xls/projects/dlbasics/dlbasics.html

Once you hae in stalled Guido's NT port of R it
is nice and easy to install the add-on packages too.

However, it would be nice to have links to the documentation
of the functions in all the packages from the "All Installed

the packages.

Is there a utility somewhere to do this?

On Windows: currently no.

[On Unix the page gets rebuilt every time you install a package to
RHOME/library] 

I extended the search engine to all installed packeges yesterday (in
the current release snapshot). Once 0.63.3 is out (scheduled for
beginning of March), you can just search for an empty string and will
get all functions listed.

Best,

Dear all,

I am currently trying to draw some barplots. I have positive and negative
values in my columns and I would like the positive values to be stacked on
top of each other in the positive and the negative values stacked in the
negative direction. Barplot just seems to add one value to the next
consecutively.

Do you see an other way to achieve what I want except rewriting the code
of barplot, such that positive and negative values are treated seperately?

Thanks! Regards, Lorenz

What did you do? The procedure is to unzip ctest.zip in the
library directory. Note that there are subtrees.

Yes, but you need the source or source-package distribution, and PERL.
The cd RHOME\src\gnuwin32\help  and make indices.  The re-makes
packages.html and functions.html.  You can re-make packages.html
from R too -- see the readme for the function name.

Ditto, on Windows, but only if you build from source (and that is
true for Unix too, AFAIK).

Peter,
of course I did the right thing; there is nothing unusual to see with the
ctest package and the standard packages are fine.

Dear all,

just a short note on how I solved my problem to display positive and
negative values in the same bar in a barplot (it is really quick and dirty
but it looks ok): I basically made two barplots one with the positive
values and one with the negative values and managed to make them touch at
zero by putting them in two adjacent plot regions (mfrow) and making the
margin at the touching sides zero in both plots.

One might also play around with the space argument:

barplot(rbind(c(1:3,3:1,-3:-1,-1:-3),c(1:6,-6:-1)),
   space=c(rep(0.5,6),-8.5,rep(0.5,5)),col=c('red','orange'))

When you require 2 digits you expect to find 5.96 printed
as 6.0, i.e. a number somewhere between 5.95 and 6.04999999999999.
This is apparently not always the case for R.
Why does 0 have a special status as trailing digit?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990226104555.525A-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

can you tell me why in the following

boxplot (gs.spe, names.x= spec.abbr, ylab= "", xlab= "species",
         yaxt= "n", xaxt= "n", cex.axis= 2)

yaxt, xaxt and cex.axis has no effect?

Even if I apply the patches (i.e. I defined a function newbxp with the
changes and a function newbox that calls newbxp instead of bxp) that
Martin wrote for boxplot a couple of weaks ago (because of a wrong warning
if one sets ylim) these parameters have no effect (and, actually, the
bounding box and xlab are not drawn anymore). 

Thanks and regards, Lorenz

Correction, _you_ expect!  Very few computer programs do that.  You
cannot `require' two digits by options(digits=2):  ?options says

  digits: controls the number of digits to print when print-
          ing numeric values. It is a suggestion only.

Because that is how the ASCII C printing functions work.  Ultimately
print() calls sprintf with a %x.yf format. What happens depends on how
that is implemented on your system.

S-PLUS has an option nsmall to format to do precisely this, and there
was a question asking how to do it on s-news today.  I have thought for
a while that we need to implement something like this in R: maybe I had
better do it....

That package works here.  Could you please be a lot more informative in
your Qs: the ctest package is changed frequently, so please tell us the
version you are trying to install (in the DESCRIPTION file) and the date on
which you downloaded it. Also, please tell us what file structure you got
when you installed it.  The zip file contains

  Length     Date   Time    Name
    32157  02-19-99 20:54   ctest/R/ctest

If that file exists at RHOME/library/ctest/R/ctest, the problem is that
R is not finding it.

Beyond that, it is easy to debug the R function (here library) to step
through the code and find where the error message is coming from, check
what file it is asking for, and if that file exists, check it is readable.

R is a collaborative project; there is no technical support service and we
do rely on users debugging problems as far as they can.

  Karl,
  that's the source version (as I guessed in my previous message).
  As written in the rw0632's README binary version for Windows are
  provided by Brian Ripley and are available at 
  CRAN/bin/windows/windows-NT/contrib/
  where,e.g., CRAN=http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R
  Of course, you can install from the source but in this case you
  have to follow the instruction in the README (and in
  README.PACKAGES in rw0632sp.zip or rw0632s.zip; indeed
  you also need one of these two files).

Thanks for all the help.
