Message-ID: <199803020131.MAA01822@yarra.vut.EDU.AU>

My question is really to Robert and Ross (and also to Bill Venables
and Dave Smith) -- but I thought that there might be wider interest in
it.

The "Notes on R" in the file Rnotes.tgz is copyrighted to the above
authors -- can I make copies of it to distribute?
 
I suspect that the intention of the authors is that Rnotes be as
re-distributable as R itself. However there is no GNU license or
equivalent on it. I don't think the fact that I have copied it off of
the net entitles me to make multiple copies, or does it?

If the original copyright is still in place you have no problems
as far as Dave or I am concerned, (but Robert and Ross may now be
the ones with the real say, of course.)  The original notes
contained a statement that they could be copied and
re-distributed free, or even on a cost recovery basis if need be,
and they have even been on sale in various University bookstores.
There is even a version up on the net if golfing(*) the web is
your bag.

I might also mention that slabs of the original document have
been included more-or-less as is in someone else's book, with
acknowledgement but without permission.  This is not really what
we would call fair use, but as far as I am concerned no one is
going to mount a legal challenge; we have better things to do.

(*) I strongly agree with the view that `golfing' much better
    expresses the tedium and pointlessness of traversing the web
    than `surfing'.)

Hi,

We just ran up against a "Memory exhausted" error trying to manipulate a
7Mb data file on R 0.61.1 FreeBSD-2.2.5, so I checked the manpage and
discovered the "-v" option.  However, I can only run "R -v 11".  Anything
higher gives the following:

OR

Similar results for -n can be obtained.  Can anyone help?

Generally it would be nice if the image saved to disk were like the one we
see while in R (X-windows).  Are they any tips on how to make it act like
that?

Also it was mentioned a while back by Ross or Robert that a new version of
all these graphics functions was coming soon.  Maybe I should just wait
for that before trying to do this set of image plots.

Thanks very much for any help

Hmm. Sounds like a bug...

Tried save.plot() ?

Yes, massive amount of new features (multiple device drivers,
dev.copy(),...), but - currently - also a handful of new and
interesting bugs...

Yes.  That also has a bug.  The bug is that the image plot contains lots
of white horizontal lines.  I was told to use the alternative method.  It
does get around the white lines, but now I can't seem to get the plot to
be square.  I guess I will try some of those other myriad par arguments.

I find that I also need to change the pars in postscript().  This gives a
square plot:

Date: Mon, 09 Mar 1998 12:09:25 -0000 ()
Subject: R-beta: cex
Message-ID: <XFMail.980309123809.plummer@iarc.fr>

Since the graphics code is being overhauled, it probably
isn't worth reporting graphics bugs, but I would like to
ask a question about the behaviour of "cex" when supplied
as an argument to plotting functions. Is it meant to be
an absolute value, or is it relative to the current value of
par("cex")? The current behaviour of R is mixed.

For example, "text" interprets a cex argument as relative
to par("cex"), wheras "axis" interprets it as an absolute value.
Note that "axis" also permanently resets the "cex" parameter,
although for some reason a call to par("cex") doesn't show this.
e.g after axis(..., cex=2), the next graphics function will behave
as if you had typed par(cex=2), although par("cex") will return
a value of 1, or whatever it was before.

I'm sure this bug has been fixed already, but if you could confirm
that the cex parameter should be _relative_ and not absolute it
will help me to decide how my graphs should behave.

Thanks.
Martyn

I find that read.table cannot handle large datasets. Suppose data is a

R -v 100

x_read.table("data")  gives
Error: memory exhausted
but
x_as.data.frame(matrix(scan("data"),byrow=T,ncol=6))
works fine.

read.table is less typing ,I can include the variable names in the first
line and in Splus executes faster. Is there a fix for read.table on the
way?

You probably need to increase -n as well as -v to read in this table.
Try setting 
 gcinfo(TRUE)
to see what is happening with the garbage collector.  Most likely it
is running out of cons cells long before it runs out of heap storage.

The reason I suspect this is because I encountered exactly the same
situation several weeks ago and Thomas Lumley pointed this out to me.

[ I wouldn't be too sure that read.table executes faster.  I think
  it just calls scan ... ]

This is a known R problem.  The real problem is that read.table reads
everything as character strings and the implementation of character
strings is "suboptimal".  This is a low-level problem and such problems
are fairly hard to fix because any changes affect almost every bit of
code.

As a temporary fix you might try enlarging the memory used for "cons cells"
with the -n flag.  Try something like

	R -n 400000 -v 10

Longer term, something will be done about it, but don't hold your breath.

You need to increase the number of cons cells as well as the vector heap
size

eg

R -v 40 -n 1000000

to allocate 1000000 cons cells instead of the standard 200000.

To see what sort of memory you are running out of, use gcinfo(T), which
tells R to report the memory status after each garbage collection.

Subject: R-beta: Printing
Message-ID: <199803101558.QAA01804@wrin27.urz.uni-wuppertal.de>

Hello,

may be I'm stupid, but I don't understand the documentation concerning 
printing.

1. How can I print a (nice) listing of any (non graphic) results?

2. What is the difference between "print(object)" and "object" (the
direct call)?

3. Which commands are concerned by the "printcmd" option (resp. how
can I print PostScript graphics directly)?

Another question: Is there any simple way to assign value labels?

Thanks!

I tried to ?ms, ?nls and apparently these aren't implemented on R yet.
However I seem to remember postings on this list having to do with fitting
nonlinear models (no I don't mean GLM type fits, I have a REAL nonlinear 
model: y=ax^b + c). So please tell me if it is possible to fit nonlinear
models in R (by least squares or ML).

There is the nlm function in R for general unconstrained optimization.
Its syntax is different from that of ms in S so you have to do a bit
of work to map from one to the other.  In some ways the scoping rules
of R make it much easier to do nonlinear optimization than in S.

As for nls I would like to re-think the approach to nonlinear least
squares in S-like languages and come up with a version that could be
used either in R or in S.  That's on the "To Do" list but that list is 
pretty long so don't hold your breath.

If some enterprising person wanted to work on it I would be delighted
to offer sage advice.  I always wanted to be a sage and now that my
hair is all gray ...

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
· Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
· Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
· Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

I am sorry for the spam  (about E mail marketing) that was just sent 
through this mailing list.

I have added some taboo words to the majordomo configuration,
in order to prevent future spam like that one.

I am very grateful for some hints (in PRIVATE !!! e-mail)
on good  (perl) regular expressions for ``taboo words'' (in the message body).

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980312092714.1585B-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

Thanks very much Douglas for the pointer to nlm.
Maybe the "Notes on R" maintainer can add at least a mention of nlm in the
section on nonlinear fitting?

I never did nonlinear fitting in S-Plus before, so I have nothing to
unlearn, but I was hoping someone could show me how to do a least squares
fit with nlm.

example:
x<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
y<-.3*x^-.6 +.2
y<-y+rnorm(6,0,.01)

Please show me how to fit the model
y=a*x^b + c
by least squares.  I would like parameter estimates plus the standard
error for each param.

(This example could replace the current nonlinear fitting section in
"Notes on R")

Thanks very much for any help!

Half an answer:

If POSIX regular expression is used, depends on

#ifdef HAVE_REGCOMP	(in  src/main/character.c)

This is defined during installation when './configure' is run
(./configure writes this result into  src/include/Platform.h ).

In the many output lines of configure, you have probably seen

----------------------- --
checking for regcomp... no
----------------------- ##
where you'd rather would want to see "yes".

------------------
A short (not so helpful) answer is
	``Get a better C compiler + libraries''.

Do you have GNU's cc (gcc) 2.7.1 or newer?
[type "gcc -v"]

Sorry that I don't know more.

Hi,

I was succesfully able to create a binary using the configure and make

Any help would be welcomed.

I was also wondering what if any "make clean"  program I can use to 
remove unwanted files.

If I remember right, this has been a known bug for long.

The current development version of R (0.62) does not suffer from this,
but it will be several weeks before a release.
[R 0.61.2 will be released the coming weekend.
 It will have eliminated quite a few problems, but not this graphics one.]

Did
	make clean

not do it?

The version at Carnegie Mellon is OK too.

At a guess, it looks like Jay King is forgetting to uncompress the file first.  Either use GNU tar with the "z" option, or do
	zcat ctest_0.9-3.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

Rename it to ctest_0.9-3.tar.gz on your Unix box. Then look at the size
(should be 10424 bytes). Then do 'tar xvpfz ctest_0.9-3.tar.gz'.

Playing myself with R is there an anonymous CVS account for update
available?

No. But a daily snapshot of the current development version is
maintained at CRAN in the src/devel directory.

It is probably a silly question, but may I humbly suggest that you may
have accidentally downloaded via ftp in ascii rather than binary?  Was the
size the same?

I've done it myself - rather like typing shutdown -r now on Christmas Day
(true story) only to find I was in an xterm logged into another machine!!

It looks like you've loaded it down using MS BRAIN DEAD NT or 95 -
somehow it just puts these bizarre filename extensions on it unless
you are very careful.

may i suggest you rename the file to ctest_0_9-3.tar.gz - then things
might work OK - winzip should ask if you want to write ctest_0_9-3.tar
as a temporary file so you can look inside the tar file 
and unix tar zxvf ctest_0_9-3.tar.gz should work  OK unless 
you have an old version of tar and then 
gunzip ctest_0_9-3.tar.gz; tar xvf ctest_0_9-3.tar should be OK

Hmm... This is not very satisfactory. 

Question to the authors: In,t one of the GNU libraries (regex, rx)
sufficient for the task?? So one having a "bad" cc can install this
library without having to install gcc...

Hi,

this modified version of help.start() makes it possible to store R Documentation
on your (intranet) webserver.

This could be necessary if you run netscape and R from different systems on one
X11 display (if there is no $RHOME directory on the host running netscape). 

help.start() <-
function (gui = "irrelevant", browser = "netscape", remote = NULL)
{
  if (is.null(remote)) {
     url <- "$RHOME/html/index.html"
  }
  else {
     url <- paste(remote, "/html/index.html", sep = "")
  }
  cat("If", browser, " is already running,\tit is *not* restarted,\n",
      "and you must switch to its window.\nOtherwise, be patient..\n")
  system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null || ",
               browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))
}


Then make an appropriate link from $RHOME into your web servers /htdocs tree and
type

help.start(remote='http://your.www.server/R')

Subject: R-beta: New user - looking for help with ANOVA
Message-ID: <199803131346.NAA17946@enterprise.smtl.co.uk>

Hi

I've just installed R on our Sun kit in the lab and on my Linux box at home.

My statistical expertise is not advanced - I have completed Open
University probability and statistics courses, and been using 
Gary Perlmans !STAT package for analyses of variance, descriptive
stats, linear regression, non-parametric stats etc for 10 years or so.
(so be gentle with me :-) )

However, R is clearly a much more powerful package, which is still
being developed (the Perlman package appears to be static) and
includes superb graphics facilities.

I have got to grips with linear regression with R, but am having
problems with anova.   It seems to me (but I may be wrong) that the
examples in the "Notes on R" paper include anova, but R doesn't
currently support this ?  

The type of anova we routinely carry out is similar to this from
Armitage (p 230):

# Subj  Sex     Mstrain Fstrain wt
1       f       1       1       0.93
2       f       1       1       1.7
3       m       1       1       0.69
4       m       1       1       0.83
5       f       1       2       1.76

Is there any way to do this analyses in R ?  Or am I on the wrong
track here ?

A secondary question - we recently had a student to some research on
maggot growth (we use maggots to clean patients wounds), and her
University supervisor used SAS or somesuch to do the analyses.  The
analyses of variance was identical to my results with the |STAT anova,
but he also did some post-anova work, called a Tukey analyses.  As far
as I can see, if your anova tells you that there are differences
between your factors, the Tukey analyses helps you determine where
those differences are.  

Is it possible to do this analyses in R ?

Apologies for the length of this.
Hope someone can help/clarify.

Regards,
Pete

>1. How can I print a (nice) listing of any (non graphic) results?

There aren't really any facilities for pretty output of text results at
the moment. Most people probably cut and paste into LaTeX. Suggestions
have been made for getting output in LaTeX or HTML directly but I don't
think anything has been done.  Somewhere in the Statlib S archive there
are functions for printing tables directly to LaTeX files, which will
probably work with R.

>2. What is the difference between "print(object)" and "object" (the
>direct call)?
At the command line, essentially nothing.  However, you can use
print(object) in a function and it will work.  Also, the return
value of print('object') is probably not 'object'.

>3. Which commands are concerned by the "printcmd" option (resp. how
>can I print PostScript graphics directly)?

All the graphics functions draw on the "current device". This is usually
an X11 (or MS-Windows) window, but the commmand
	postscript("file.ps")  
sends future graphics output to the PostScript file. Also, in the Unix
version, print.plot() and save.plot("file.ps") copy the contents of
the x11 window in PostScript form to the printer or "file.ps"
respectively. The copying is not perfect in version 0.61, particularly
with the image() command, where white lines appear due to some rounding
problem.

If the plot on the screen is in color then the PostScript file produced by
save.plot() or print.plot() will be in color (unlike in S-PLUS), and so
will print in color or shades of gray (depending on your printer).

>Another question: Is there any simple way to assign value labels?

 Some of the functions of variable labels in eg SPSS are performed by
factor levels, so if you use
	x<-factor(x,labels=c("first level","second level","third level"))
the factor labels will usually appear in output. read.table() converts
non-numeric data to factors by default, which means that the data file can
contain labels instead of the data.

No, the post-hoc tests ("Tukey" et al) are not yet available in R ("base").
Maybe in a contributed package ?

Subject: R-beta: R with gnuwin32 
Message-ID: <19980315172152.6154.qmail@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

I have been using R under Linux for more than a year and 
I think that it is great.
Last week, I downloaded the binary Ms Windows version. I wanted
to test it for my students.  Our labs are under Bill Gates.
I am not happy but I can do nothing.

R worked. But, I could not use the dyn.load command
with some dll built with one of the ports of
gcc for windows 95/nt (I used the ecgs-mingw32 ports
http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32).
The same dll's work with Xlisp-Stat. Then, I rebember something posted
by Luke Tierney somewhere about dll's and the Watcom compiler.
I took a look to his pages and found out  that perhaps the problem is not 
ecgs but  Watcom
( http://stat.umn.edu/~luke/xls/projects/dlbasics/dlbasics.html).

No dyn.load means no additional packages. Since I don't want
to buy a commercial compiler to support free software, this
morning I tried to recompile the 0.61.1 distribution with
egcs.  Now, after more than 10000 grep's to understand
the differences between the windows sources and the unix ones,
I have a version of R-0.61.1 under Win95. It works. It seems
also a little faster than the october binary version 
(perhaps since I compiled the fortran sources directly
using g77).
But I have some questions:
(a) The windows sources in R-0.61.1 are not the ones used
to build the last windows distribution in CRAN. For example,
the menus are different and also the src/library/base/R/system.win has no
support for library. Where can I find the new sources?
(b) I prepared a Makefile that build the system using the
directory structure of R-0.61.1 under unix. But I don't known
the differences between the the 0.61 version and the 0.50.xxx
for which src/library/base/R/system.win. has been wrote.
Where can I find a description of the differences?
(c) Is someone interested in this port? If yes, I can make it available.
I tried to make rebuilding easy. Essentially, you untar a small archive 
in src/ (essentially the makefiles and the pacthed windows sources). 
Then
  make RHOME=??? firstofall
  make RHOME=??? HAVEG77=[YES,NO] 
  make RHOME=??? HAVEG77=[YES,NO] packages
should build and install the system with all the packages in src/library;
  make RHOME=??? HAVEG77=[YES,NO] pkg-???
will make the package ???. You need gnu-make+sed+rm+cp+ls.
( perhaps also a sh-like shell (I used bash)).
I have not tried but this should work also with the Cygnus and
the gcc-mingw32 port of gcc. Indeed, for this reason, I used the
HAVEG77 flag.
I believe that is not appropriate to make a binary distribution available
before (i) the base/R/system.win file has been fixed (or at least
before I, or better, someone else understand, what is going);
(ii) more testing.
(d) I tried to recompile the regex library in the src/regex
directory. But there is no regex.h file. So, I gave up.
  (d1) Are the source there to let people without regex
       to build the library? If yes, how?
       Where can I find the regex.h file for that
       version of the library which is not the gnu rl one?
  (d2) Have someone tried to use some free regex library
       under mingw32? 
(e) The last point is a proposal for a medium term project.
The modifications that I made were necessary to update the
windows sources to the changes made in the system interface
(R_ReadConsole, R_WriteConsole,....). Now, the gnuplot people
has developed a layer between stdio and a windows console
(a graphics not a ms-dos one). In this way, for example,
just doing some #undef and some  #define, you can printf
on the console. They also have a version of readline.
If we borrow the layer we can hope to use the unix/system.c
file without changes (or with few changes). And hence,
it will be easier for the developers to bring the MsWindows
version update with the main unix one.

I know. I wrote too much and people do not survive too much
when I write or speak in English. Hence, please, forgive me. 
Thanks,
guido masarotto

1) This is very interesting stuff.

2) But it really belongs on R-devel, not R-help. R-help is for helping
users with installing and using R, not debating its future or
discussing technical issues. Could I ask you to subscribe and then we
move the discussion there? (Don't worry, R-devel is not a very high
volume list.)

Same thing here.

I tried essentially the same stunt, but couldn't figure out how to get
the Windows console and graphics going, "Multiple Document Interface"
and all that. In particular, there's trouble with the gnuwin header
files versus the MS Platform SDK used in the sources. Does this mean
that you have a version running just like the "official" one? And
could it run under Win3 too?

I wouldn't be surprised, although Watcon does some register-passing
tricks, which one would think made it faster, (as well as incompatible
with other C compilers...!)

In the R-snapshot at CRAN (src/devel), I think. The very latest
versions are on Roberts computer...

Hmm. I don't know exactly what you mean here. I don't think that there
is a true writeup documenting any of this.

Definitely!

If yes, I can make it available.

How about the cross-compilers?

Agreed, but binaries (of R *and* all the packages) will in a
not-so-long perspective be needed for practical people.

Hmm. Does this line in src/regex/WHATSNEW ring a bell? (Not that I
know what I'm talking about, I just use grep...)

you have to build regex.h explicitly by "make h".  The two known bugs

This sounds interesting. An alternative that I have been playing with
is to use Tcl/Tk, with a longer term perspective of developing R/Tk
language bindings like in STk (Scheme/Tk). This could have the benefit
of automatic (hah!) *Mac* portability.

Note, BTW, that some substantial changes have been made in the
nonreleased 0.62 version (see aforementioned snapshot) to the parser
and I/O parts, specifically to cater for windowing systems.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980316083931.225C-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I wanted to have a figure consisting of 2 square plots, one above the
other (2 rows, 1 column).
I am using 61.1 on Linux.

I did:
> x1<-rnorm(100)
> y1<-rnorm(100)
> par(mfcol=c(2,1))
> plot(x1,y1,pty="s",mfg=c(1,1,2,1))
> plot(x1,y1,pty="s",mfg=c(2,1,2,1))

The resulting figure consists of two plots, one above each other, BUT they
are extremely squished in the y direction: each one is 12 cm wide by 4 cm
high.  ( I am basing this on 1)R Graphics window 2) saved figure to
postscript file and it is this way too).  The space does not appear to be
used very efficiently:  there is a big empty space at the top and in
between the two plots.

Please tell me how to get the two plots in the multiplot figure to be
square.

Thanks very much for any help.

Hi Jim,

I find with my toy examples that this is a bit better
 sqrt(diag(solve(out$hessian))*2*out$minimum/(length(y)-2))
                                                        ^
                                                     # params (2 for line)
So for least squares you need factor
2*MSE

OK. I had to add 'levels=1:n' (number of values), otherwise R complains
about labels for values not present in tha data. Now it works fine.

Next stupid question:-)

Is there a similar way to assign variable labels (besides the names,
of course)?

Thanks a lot for your help!

No.  You can use arbitrarily long variable names, though.

Subject: R-beta: locfit -> CRAN
Message-ID: <350E7038.7AB36382@bell-labs.com>

The locfit library is now available through CRAN, in the
Contributed R Code directory. Locfit fits local regression,
likelihood and density estimation models, in the spirit
of loess but with many additional features. To install,
unpack the locfit_19980309.tar.gz file, and
R INSTALL locfit

Most of the functionality and examples on my home page
http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/project/locfit/ should work
in R, with the exception of trellis displays.

Thanks to Kurt Hornik for helping with the port and testing.

Sincerely,

Subject: R-beta: R-0.61.2 released
Message-ID: <x2g1khh1ar.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


R-0.61.2.tgz is now available from the Auckland FTP site, from where
it should spread to the CRAN sites during the next day or two. Unless
you're in a big hurry or actually living in New Zealand, please don't
get it from Auckland. 

There is also an R-0.61.1-0.61.2.diff.gz which can be used to patch an
existing R-0.61.1. Instructions for patching are in the VERSION file
in same directory.

This release mainly fixes a number of trivial bugs (segfaults from
strange constructions and the like). One major change is that the
changes to factor coercion that was introduced previously was deemed
to be buggy after all, so now as.numeric(factor(100,200)) == 1:2
again. A few features was also allowed to trickle down from the 0.62
as-yet-unreleased version.

Jim Lindsey will probably be disappointed in finding that his
favourite model formula bugs are still there. This is not because we
disagree that they are bugs or have forgotten all about them, but
fixing it turned out to require more substantial changes than we cared
to introduce in a patch release.

This release was made primarily to be included in the Debian Linux 2.0
release. For this reason the problems with non-GNU make programs have
not been touched at all.

I had to get rid off ellipses at the line that calls contour(in locfit.s):
From:
contour(m1, m2,matrix(y, nrow = length(m1)),
 ... )
To:
contour(m1, m2,matrix(y, nrow = length(m1)) )

I was getting an error about non used arg to contour function.
Rest of the examples from the web site seem to work, Well, 3D perspective plots
of course does not work yet!

Subject: R-beta: exchanging data between R/Splus and SPSS
Message-ID: <199803171724.SAA16110@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>


Hi,

is there any way to exchange (A LOT OF) data between SPPS and R/Splus,
i.e., I want to get data from SPSS into R. It is a huge data frame
with many columns being factors, so manual conversion is out of
question (and there are more data to come).

Exporting ASCII from SPSS seems to loose all level names, and the
portable SPSS format doesn't look too nice.

I've searched S-news and statlib, but only found info about DBMS/copy
which is not installed at our university. Did I miss something?

Any help appreciated,
Fritz Leisch

Fritz,

You may want to contact Ben Pfaff about this.  Ben is the author of
PSPP, a freely-available SPSS clone.  It may be able to read the SPSS
format and put it into something that would be easier to bring into
R/Splus.

Do you mean Fiasco ( http://gnu.linux.ucla.edu/software/fiasco/ )?

Extract from start of home page:
============================================================================
Fiasco is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It interprets
commands in the SPSS language and produces tabular output in ASCII or
PostScript format. The name Fiasco stands for Fiasco Implements Accurate
Statistical COmputations. 

Fiasco development is ongoing. It already supports a large subset of SPSS's
transformation language. Its statistical procedure support is currently
limited, but growing. 

Source code for the latest development release of Fiasco is available from the
alpha.gnu.org ftp site.

Ben can give the definitive answer but AFAIK fiasco has metamorphosed
into PSPP whose development is ongoing.  The latest version of pspp is
0.1.16, available from ftp://pfaffben.user.msu.edu/pspp/

You will see that earlier versions of fiasco are in that directory too.

Affirmative. Is that "Pfaff's Statistical Program Package", BTW? Last
I looked, it hadn't come very far in the way of actual statistics
(concentrating on the database handling issues), and certainly none of
the interactive features of SPSS. I wonder how far it is now?

Hi everyone, this is PSPP's author speaking :-)  FWIW, PSPP has no
``official'' expansion, but the one that I prefer is Putting
Statistics in their Proper Place (in the hands of all users).

I'm afraid that it's still true that the statistical procedures aren't
very advanced.  We have	DESCRIPTIVES and FREQUENCIES fully
implemented.  John Williams has T-TEST mostly finished.  I am going to
start work on CROSSTABS any day now.

However, almost all of the ``database handling'' is done, with just
ADD FILES and UPDATE still wanting.

I'm looking for statistically knowledgeable people who are willing to
help me with algorithms, by the way.  You wouldn't need programming
experience for this, just statistical knowledge (which I don't have).
Contact me in private if you'd like to help.

As for the immediate question of exchanging data between R and SPSS, I
guess I'd need more details before I could be of any real help.
Another good place to ask is the newsgroup comp.soft-sys.stat.spss.  I
read this group as well.

Confirmed. ftp://pfaffben.user.msu.edu/fiasco -> pspp and (from the README
under pspp):
==================================================================
This is the distribution archive for PSPP, a free, compatible
replacement for the statistical program SPSS.  PSPP was originally
named Fiasco.

Currently PSPP source code is available from the following sites:

* ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/pspp

This site always has the latest sources for PSPP and patches from
earlier versions.

* ftp://pfaffben.user.msu.edu/pub/pspp

This site has source code tarballs for present and past versions, as
well as patches.  Unfortunately, this site is not available from
mid-December to mid-January or mid-May to mid-August.

Binaries are not yet available for any OS.

Your question assumes there is such a parameter.  I don't believe
this is the case.  Brian Ripley has written a function "eqscplot"
for S-PLUS that does carefully arrange for the x- and y-scales to
be equal.  It is part of the MASS library, and I believe will
become available in CRAN when the copyright issues are finally
sorted (which may be now, but I am not quite sure).

While you are waiting for Bill Venables's suggestion to happen, maybe this
will work:

> x<-rnorm(100)
> y<-rnorm(100)
> plot(x,y,xlim=c(-3,3), ylim=c(-3,3))
                 min,max 
This worked for me just now (same tick marks and labels on both axes).

Now if you are asking in addition how to ensure the two axes have the same
physical dimensions so the plot is actually square...
Well this should work
plot(...,pty="s")
but it doesn't due to a bug in R.  pty="s" does absolutely nothing so far
as I can tell.

My workaround is to force it to be square by fooling around with the
postscript(...,width=..., height=...) command.  I personally think it is a
design error in S-Plus/R for postscript() to modify the appearance of the
plot compared to how it looks in the Graphics window.

Mmm....no. Not unless you want all devices to give identical output.
Different devices have different characteristics, media sizes, physical
fonts, etc. postscript() and x11() are just two different device
drivers. 

However, having dev.print/print.plot departing (much) from what you
see on the screen *is* probably a bug (although that obviously assumes
that the hardcopy device is PostScript).

I knew people would disagree.
I have this opinion from years of working on the Mac, where the WYSIWYG
philosophy permeated everything.  The monitor and the printer were always
coordinated so the physical dimensions of a figure on the monitor and the
physical dimensions of the figure on the printer were identical.  (I
am including fonts of course) This was achieved despite the huge diffs in
monitor and laser printer resolution. I think this approach was also used
on NeXT.  And it is a wonderful time-saver for people who do graphics.
If you haven't experienced it, you don't know what you're missing.

Right now the only way to make figs look the way you want in R (X11) is
through trial and error (very time-consuming). (BTW using Mac R gives
figures with the lovely monitor=printer characteristics I've been talking
about, due to system software)

I know this lack of output device coordination was a design decision
(maybe not by S-Plus but at level of X-windows etc).  But it was a bad
decision.

Yes, it is even better on nextstep, now to be reincarnated in Apple's  
Rhapsody, which uses postscript to display both on screen and on paper (unlike  
the Mac), thus unifying the imaging.

Very true.  Also, colors on NeXT were well matched between monitor
and output devices.

Well, you can take a couple measurements and deterine the pixel size
(and choose a mode that gives square pixels!).  Color is a much harder
problem unless you are willing to limit yourself to a small set of
colors.

Workstations and X-terminals generally have known pixel sizes (usually 72
or 100 dppi) and can be used to get consistent sizes (and have good color
control).  Using XFree86 I do miss the lack of control over these
factors, but it does give a lot of bang for the $ when I'm not fussing
over publication quality output. 

I do hope that these issues will eventually be addressed in XFree86.

I have added a new "par" (I hate myself whenever I do that ...) called
"din" which will get the size of the current device.  Given this, it
will be possible to  print the current plot the same size, or at least
with the same aspect ratio as the current one.

This will require some tweaking of the postscript driver to do automatic
shrinking and rotation of plots.  Its not too far away now.

I think that what you want is important an I have tried to build the
R graphics system in a way which will at least partially support
what you want (fixed colors, linetypes etc).  There's just a bit more
to do ...

I might say that producing "WYSIWYG" output on the Mac was/is a nightmare.
The Mac graphics more really assumes that printers are do tmatrix with the
same dot pitch as the screen.

Display postscript really provides the best kind of solution.  Roll on
GNUStep ...

Has anyone tried to build R on Suns by linking to the versions of BLAS and 
LINPACK in the Sun Performance Library rather than the standard versions 
included in the distribution? On the face of it this would seem to be a highly 
desirable thing to do since these versions of the routines are more efficient 
and can exploit parallelism on multiprocessor machines.

I don't know for sure (we don't ``want to'' afford these ..),
but I assume all of these are relying on compiled code, the source of which
is not available.

If this was not true, there would be some chance that (some) of their
functions run flawlessly in R.
Actually, (almost) all the graphics which relies on Trellis doesn't work
either in R.

For wavelets, there is a free wavelets package (of Guy Nason) on Statlib.
This should be portable more or less easily to R.

For ARCH, you may get a (very) partial solution, by using Paul Gilbert's
DSE library (available from <<CRAN>>/src/contrib/devel/dse* )

WaveThres package is already ported to R by Arne Kovac. Check CRAN contrib. But
still without "persp" plotting, you wont get the pretty pictures you could with

Hello,

I'd like to thank the people who replied to my query about the
Plot and scale. I tried  all the propositions and they works
fine, but the one I liked and that worked very well is
the Brian Ripley's function that  our dear Vill Venables from
Australia send me.
If someone needs to use this function and with the permission
of Vill, I can send it to him/her. It works very well.

Thanks

I believe you can do this by specifying the dispersion argument to
summary.glm()
ie
	model<-glm(y~x,family=Gamma)
	summary(model,dispersion=1)

I looked at this a little last fall after noticing
that matrix multiplication performance in R was far below
that achievable performance in FORTRAN or C using the
BLAS and LAPACK. I've been looking for notes on this but
can't find them. My recollection was that roughly speaking
I could get 100MFLOPS on a SPARC ULtra 2300 single processor
for matrix multiply for matrices bigger than 100x100 using
FORTRAN, while I was getting less than 10MFLOPS in R (or SPLUS).
These numbers may not be accurate so take them with a grain of salt.
I then did a very quick test of trying to link the BLAS DGEMM matrix
multiply routine with R. I only remember the bottom line: it wasn't
worth pursuing further because even though the matrix multiply in
FORTRAN was sped up considerably, there was still a lot of overhead
passing data
back and forth between R and the FORTRAN routine. 

It is possible that for very large problems there may still be an
advantage
of linking an optimized BLAS or LAPACK routine since execution time
should
be O(n^3) while time spent passing matrices as arguments should be
O(n^2) - it just wasn't worth it for the problems I was trying.

Another point - I found that compiling the BLAS and LAPACK source code
available from NETLIB gave the about the same results as the "optimized"
SUN Performance Library routines, so using the SUN routines just saves
time figuring out how to compile them. I never did finish trying to do
the link with R since it didn't seem worth the effort.

I took a look to the original code, not the R/S one.
There igamma (and also ibeta which the r distribution misses too)
are defined in the file random.c.
I inserted them in the locfit/src-c/random.c (see below) and then 
things seem to go well (= the previous example works and
give sensible results).
Perhaps, a better possibility is to define igamma and ibeta using
the R pgamma and pbeta function. However, I have not tried it.

It seems there are problems with mfg, both the old version .61.2 and the
snapshot .62.

I'm not sure if 2,1 is considered the top or the bottom position on the
page, but whether you say mfg=c(2,1,2,1) or mfg=c(1,1,2,1), the first plot
is always drawn at the top position.
> plot(x,y,mfg=c(2,1,2,1))
Now the second plot is drawn at the bottom position.  Again, the mfg
argument has no effect. The second plot is always at the bottom
> plot(x,y1,mfg=c(2,1,2,1))
Now the whole figure is cleared and a single plot appears at the top.

Further plots alternate in position in this way, independent of mfg.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980325105828.10239B-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

The online help in R has errors concerning mai and mar.

 mai: A numerical vector of the form `c(xb, xt, yl, yr)'
  which gives the margin size specified in inches.

 mar: A numerical vector of the form `c(xb, xt, yl, yr)'
  which gives the lines of margin to be specified on
  the four sides of the plot.  The default is `c(5,4, 4, 2) + 0.1'.

This would be bad if it were true, since it is different from S-Plus.
However after testing I find that these actually work the same as S-Plus,
so the help should say:

 mai: A numerical vector of the form `c(xb, yl, xt, yr)'
  which gives the margin size specified in inches.

 mar: A numerical vector of the form `c(xb, yl, xt, yr)'
  which gives the lines of margin to be specified on
  the four sides of the plot.  The default is `c(5,4, 4, 2) + 0.1'.

No!
(maybe you are confusing with the  exponential distribution,
 where what S/R calls "rate" is often also written as \lambda in the text
 books).

PS. You could have tried 
	mean(rpois(1000, lambda = 10))

I just checked my S manual and it appears that layout parameters like
can "mfg" only be given in par().  I think that in fact "mfg" is only
meant to be queried.


Perhaps not unrelatedly ...

After some discussion with Paul Murrell I am inclined to think that
the whole graphics system needs a rewrite, even though this would
mean incompatibility with S.  A major problem is that the whole "par"
system does not work when devices can be resized.  Consider the
following series of steps:

	x11()
	opar <- par()		# save parameters

	# manually resize window

	par(opar)		# restore saved parameters

Before the resize, "fig" and "fin" are compatible, but after the resize
they are not.  So which should be used to determine the plot layout?

[ Splus seems to get around this by not changing the nominal plot size
when the graphics window is resized.  (Check the value of "din", "fin",
etc. before and after a resize)]

In Paul's work on maintaining display lists, he keeps track of the
units which a user used to set up a plot (was it "fin" or "fig"?)
and recomputes plot layouts using this unit information.

In interpreted code the saving and restoring of the graphics state is
done with

	opar <- par()

	...

	par(opar)

This can't work when window resizing is allowed.

Does anyone have any thoughts about how important it is to retain
compatibility with the S way of doing things?

Yes.  pty is another, for example.

 > I think that in fact "mfg" is only meant to be queried.

No.  One use for setting mfg is to produce a page of plots in
portrait orientation with, say, two small plots on the top half
of the page and one long flat one along the bottom.  to wit

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(... first ...)
plot(... second ...)
par(mfg = c(2,1,2,1)
tsplot(... long, lazy plot across bottom ...)

Although this is possible, I prefer to do this kind of thing
with the "fig" parameter.  In fact I use mfrow, mfcol and mfg as
little as possible since they waste so much of the space with
axes and labels.

I don't see much value in even trying to maintain compatibility
at this level.  The big corporate development at MathSoft Seattle
has been the acquisition of Axum, so the inventive energy and
experience are in place to give the graphics system (of S-PLUS at
any rate) the shake-up of its life.  S-PLUS 4.0 is effectively an
Axum dll, in fact, so the tail already wags the dog.  What next?
Compatibility is a worthwhile ideal in principle but not if it
means sacrificing flexibility or quality in graphics and
especially if it is going to be impossible to achieve, anyway.

If the announced MathSoft agenda is realistic (not all that
likely, I know, but if...) R and S will not even be approximately
compatible high level languages by the end of the year.

Bill.

Message-ID: <199803261359.OAA14588@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>


Hi,

I've included Guido Masarotto's port of R 0.61.1 to MS Windows 95/NT
in $CRAN/bin/ms-windows-32 ... you can find both the sources and
binaries there.

I include Guido's README below.

Thanks again to Guido for making this port available!

Best,
Fritz Leisch



**********************************************************

rgnwbin.tgz and rgnwsrc.tgz are the first results of an attempt to
build R for Win95 and WinNT using egcs-mingw32.

The advantages over the binaries for MsWindows that can be found in CRAN
are:
1. R seems to run faster. Some simple (perhaps too simple)
   benchmarks point to a 20% gain.
2. The port is based on a more recent version (0.61.1) and it is more
   complete (more "system calls": system, tempfile, unlink, 
   WinExec - to launch applications without waiting for the result;
   support for the standard help system: try help(), help(abline),
   help(line,eda), ?women, data(), library())
3. A new menu item "Stop current computation" make  possible 
   to interupt long computation (but only when  something is printed).
4. Since egcs-mingw32 uses the standard C calling convention, 
   you don't need a Watcom compiler to build dynamic link libraries.
   Indeed, this was my original motivation.
5. It should be easy to use some other gnu-win32 compilers (maybe
   running on a non MsWindows machine). It should be easy to 
   adapt the port to lcc-win32, too.
   
But remember: this is experimental code so
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      USE IT AT YOUR RISK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BINARY DISTRIBUTION
Just unpack rgwnbin.tgz somewhere.
The executable is R.GNW\bin\R.exe. This binary distribution
includes only the standard packages (base+eda+mva+stepfun).

SOURCE DISTRIBUTION
This is an add-on to the R-0.61.1 distribution.
So unpack R-0.61.1.tar.gz somewhere.
Then, from the same directory, unpack rgwnsrc.tgz.
To rebuild the system, go to R-0.61.1/src/gnuwin32.
Then
   > make
should build the standard stuff.
To add a new package, you should
a) download it; 
b) unpack it in the R-0.61.1/src directory.
c) go to the R-0.61.1/src/gnuwin32 directory and type
   > make pkg-xxx
   where xxx is the name of the package.
   You should get the directory R-0.61.1/library/xxx
   and its subdirectory R/ (the r-code) data/ (the 
   data of the package) R/libs (the dynamic link library) and
   the support for the help system (INDEX, TITLE, an updated
   LibIndex). Of course, the data and libs subdirectory
   can be missing.
d) if you want the documentation, you can download 
   the preformatted one.Then  unpack it in the R-0.61.1
   (not in the R-0.61.1/src) directory. If you don't need
   the LaTeX files, remove them.

Note:
(1) Of course, you need a compiler. As I have said I used 
    the egcs-mingw32 one:
    http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/
(2) You must also have a GNU make and some standard unix
    command (ls,cat,sed,rm). Furthemore, make and this
    command must be able to overcome the MsDOS limitation
    about the length of a command.
    I used the ones coming with the djgpp compiler.
    According to me, they are the best version for dos and
    windows. You can find it in any SIMTEL mirror.
    If you want, I can make available a small file with
    only the needed tools.
(3) The gnuwin32/Makefile use the g77 Fortran compiler.
    If you don't have it, or if you don't want to use it,
    you can use something like
      > make HAVEG77=NO 
    or
      > make HAVEG77=NO pkg-xxx
    For example, the g77 compiler in egcs-mingw32 was
    not able to compile the fortran code in the acepack package.
    However, I was able to build this package with the command
      > make HAVEG77=NO pkg-acepack
(4) When installing a package, if in R-0.61.1/src/library/xxx/R
    exist a file with name yyy.gnw then this file is used
    and files with name yyy or yyy.somethingelse are
    ignored. In this way, you can configure the R code
    of the package. An example is the base/R/system.gnw
    file.
(5) This is not a developer's distribution. For example, dependences
    are written in a silly way. Furthemore, all the code
    in src/appl/, src/appl-f,..... is compiled.
    No use of the original Makefile is done.
    Hence, you have to start from a cleaned distribution.


BUGS and TODO
(0) The English of this README.
(1) If you exit from the edit windows and this is empty you get a
    segmentation fault. This happens also on my Linux box. So,
    it seem to be a general problem.
(2) The dll's are statically linked with the other R code.
    So they get support for the routines that they need.
    In this way, they work but are big. We should have
    a large R.dll with all the standard code. Then 
    the executable and the dll's should simply import
    from R.dll.
(3) Try and adapt this port to other win32 compiler.
    It should be easy. So, why don't try?
(4) The system command does not work if the command to be
    execute require some user interaction. It is just a 
    "simulated  reading pipe for a broken OS".
(5) I inserted an event loop at the beginning of the
    function which print to the console. In this way,
    you can interupt the computation or, for example,
    give the focus to the graphics window.
    But only when you print. A call to the event loop
    must be inserted inside the "main" code.
    But, for the moment, I decided to leave the "main"
    code untouched.
(6) When building package xxx, all the C and Fortran files
    found in library/xxx/src (or library/xxx/src-c if
    you don't have the g77 compiler) are compiled
    and putted in a dll. On the contrary, we have to make
    use of the original Makefile.
(7) The Windows code must be cleaned.

In my opinion the S way of doing graphics is quite messy.  The parameters
have complicated effects upon one another. For example a side-effect of 
mar is that it changes the aspect ratio of the plot. But it would make
much more sense to have a parameter whose sole purpose is to vary the
aspect ratio of the plot. And how about another parameter that scales
the whole plot including fonts? So I don't see the S way as sacred at all.
It all needs to be better thought out I would say.

placing (in the locfit/src/family.c file)

extern double pgamma(), pbeta();
#define igamma(x,p) pgamma(x,p,1.0)
#define ibeta(x,a,b) pbeta(x,a,b)

seems to solve the problem. (Big plus of R over S: pgamma() etc. can be
called directly,
instead of cribbing source code!).


A second problem is that the R (0.61.1) model.extract() function differs
from the
S version, and the cens argument won't be interpreted properly. Adding
the following
modified model.extract() to the locfit/R/lfrsup.r file should work...

model.extract <-
function (frame, component)
{
        component <- as.character(substitute(component))
        rval <- switch(component, response = model.response(frame),
                offset = model.offset(frame), weights =
frame$"(weights)",
                start = frame$"(start)", cens=frame$"(cens)",
                base=frame$"(base)")
        if (length(rval) == nrow(frame))
                names(rval) <- attr(frame, "row.names")
        else if (is.matrix(rval) && nrow(rval) == nrow(frame)) {
                t1 <- dimnames(rval)
                dimnames(rval) <- list(attr(frame, "row.names"),
                        t1[[2]])
        }
        return(rval)
}

You must have been that you didn't have problems with "MASS".
Part of it certainly is because V&R use a very good S programming style.

Many things (95%, 98% ??)  *do* work out of the box.
But the remaining (2-5%) can be a pain, especially if they are hidden,
and don't even produce an obvious error message.

I'm sure XploRe has some (even many?) pluses over R; especially the
availability of modern non/semi-parametric curve fitting and other modern
statistical methods and the extensive and nicely written
documentation.. and ... and...

Programming Language: I'd be interested to hear opinions here.
	I remember having preferred the S language (of which R is a dialect)
	quite a bit.  However, I am severely biased... :-)

The big drawback for many of the "R fans" is that it is
commercial and only available as binary, and therefore not free in the
sense of the Free Software Foundation.
[[Also: There is a saying that software is only *really* documented,
	and usable for scientific purposes

Subject: R-beta: multiplot using fig
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980326095730.27292A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I followed Bill Venables's suggestion and tried to make a multiplot figure
with fig (using R .62).

> x<-rnorm(100)
> y<-rnorm(100)
> x11()      
> par(fig=c(0,2/3,0,1))
> plot(x,y)
> par(fig=c(2/3,1,0,1))
> qqnorm(x)
> postscript(file="twoplot.ps")           
> par(fig=c(0,2/3,0,1))
> plot(x,y)
>  par(fig=c(2/3,1,0,1))
> qqnorm(x)

However using both the X11 and postscript devices, it doesn't work.
In X11(), the plot first appears on the left, then disappears after the
call to qqnorm.  In postscript device, the two plots are on separate
pages.

Often I need to make multifigures where e.g. the two stacked on top of
each other have the same x variable and have the same axes to facilitate
comparison. I am finding it a problem to get rid of the numerical labels
and the text label at the bottom of the top plot (which are unnecessary
and bad form) and without a large empty gap between the two plots. This is
an S problem.  If I reduce the bottom margin around the indiv plots I get
the bottom label on the bottom plot clipped.  If I just reduce the bottom
margin on the top plot, the aspect ratio of the top plot differs from the
bottom.  I think what is needed is an ability to have overlapping plot
regions instead of tiled.  That way I can overlap the top of the bottom
plot over the empty region at the bottom of the top plot.

There is probably a way to do what I want, but I haven't figured it out
yet!  Thanks for any help.

Some other things involved in porting even when the S code is ok:
* C, and even more so FORTRAN, tends to need minor changes since R only
allows double precision (FORTRAN programmers often use REAL instead of
DOUBLE PRECISION, which is quite a bit faster on some computers (though 
not x86s))
* The help pages need to be converted to R help format (we have a Perl
script for this)
* The directory structure for an R package is different.

These are all routine (unlike the occasional changes to the interpreted
code), but still need to be done to make a package (as distinct from a
code fragment) useful.

One advantage of R for teaching purposes is its compatibility with
S(-PLUS), which is becoming very popular out there in the 'Real World',
particularly in biostatistics.

Here is a more general solution to the model.extract problem, rather than
forcing developers to edit model.extract every time they introduce a new
argument.

model.extract<- function (frame, component) 
{
        component <- as.character(substitute(component))
        rval <- switch(component, response = model.response(frame), 
                offset = model.offset(frame), weights = frame$"(weights)", 
                start = frame$"(start)")
        if (is.null(rval)) {
                name <- paste("frame$\"(", component, ")\"", 
                        sep = "")
                rval <- eval(parse(text = name)[1])
        }
        if (length(rval) == nrow(frame)) 
                names(rval) <- attr(frame, "row.names")
        else if (is.matrix(rval) && nrow(rval) == nrow(frame)) {
                t1 <- dimnames(rval)
                dimnames(rval) <- list(attr(frame, "row.names"), 
                        t1[[2]])
        }
        return(rval)
}

Of course I was only describing what I use in S-PLUS; I'm not

Well, of course.  :-)

Well, because not all of it will work straight out of the box.  I
should affirm that both V&R would like the V&R software to be
freely and publicly available to R users, but we have to be
careful to observe some copyright niceties.  Although we wrote
the code and the book, the publisher now officially owns the
copyright to both, (which was the deal, of course).

With free upgrades, as well?  (Asked he, more or less
rhetorically.)  That would make it very attractive since it is a
very professional product with extremely good graphics (despite
it's execrable name!).

Hello!

First of all I would like to thank very much Guido Masarotto for the latest
Win32 version of R. I've installed it painlessly on WinNT 4 Workstation,
and it is loading and running fast. The only problems I've had thus far are
demos 6 to 8 ("recursion", "scoping", and "is.things"), which cause a
memory protection fault.

I've a question regarding the image function, which I use frequently and
for various purposes. Apparently, the S and the R version of the image
function don't behave the same way. I've attached below a function that
under S produces chessboard-like figures, while it produces irregular
pattern with R (never mind different colours in R and S, this is not a
point). Does anybody know how can one obtain the chessboard images (squares
or rectangles of the same size) with R?

Best regards

Zivan

Hello,
I am inexperienced in C program compilation and I receive the following
error during the compilation of R (version 0.61.2) for Solaris 2.6.
I have installed the gcc 2.8.0 version.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980327101854.10305A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

Maybe this is the proper behaviour, but it was puzzling to me.
My original data are recorded to 6 decimal places, and I trust all those
numbers (microsecond timer).

I scan the data in.  Now I use write (or dput) to save them back to
disk. Examining the numbers with an editor I see that a number like
 1.321159
is still the same, but a number like
3195.423362
becomes
3195.423
It seems that write or dput wants the number to have only 7 digits in
total.

I solved this problem by using save/load instead of write/scan or
dput/dget.  I am just reporting this because it seems odd.

I have this problem under SunOS.  It seems that there is something wrong
with your system's version of the readline library.  You can either get a
new version (from any GNU archive) or build R without readline support.
This disables the nice command-line editing features, but you can get them
back by running R under emacs using ESS (see the R FAQ for details).

You can disable readline support by removing the line
   #define HAVE_LIBREADLINE 1
from src/include/Platform.h

(In theory you should be able to just do 
	configure --without-readline
 but this hasn't been implemented)

Message-ID: <Pine.3.87.9803271310.A18041-0100000@superh.hg.med.umich.edu>

R-users,

I would like to take advantage of R's mathematical typesetting 
capabilities in the graphical environment using text(..., 
expression(...)), however, I can't figure out how to include in the 
expression some evaluated function.  For example,

> x <- 1:8
> plot(1:10, 1:10)
> text(5, 5, expression(sum(x[i], i == 1, length(x)))  # would like "8" 
                                        # substituted for length(x) here

Is there a way to replace length(x) with the returned value of the 
function?

Thanks for any advice,

Matt

Yes:
	R>text(5,5,parse(text=paste("sum(x[i],i==1,",length(x),")",sep="")))

What we do here is construct a string
	R> paste("sum(x[i],i==1,",length(x),")",sep="")
	[1] "sum(x[i],i==1,8)"
containing the returned value of length(x), and then
send it to the R parser. This returns a list of calls, ie, an expression.
	R> parse(text=paste("sum(x[i],i==1,",length(x),")",sep=""))
	expression(sum(x[i], i == 1, 8))
which is what you need to use as the argument to text().

The first problem (not magically loading of the shared

.First.lib <- function(lib, pkg) {
  library.dynam("acepack", pkg, lib)
  }
  
if (version$minor < "0.62")
    library.dynam("acepack")

but the correct test, at least the one which works on my machine,
should be
---------------------------------------------------------
if (version$minor < "62.0")
    library.dynam("acepack")
----------------------------------------------------------

Does someone here has some hints for the second (the segmentation
fault) ?
Thanks in advance.

ps1. I also tried to link the shared library with libf2c as
     suggested in the makefile but nothing changed.
     BTW, which version of libf2c?
ps2. The avas function works without any problems.

There is a new acepack (1.1) with a corrected version of the FORTRAN code
at CRAN as of a couple of days ago.  There were some problems with how I
had converted it to double precision (I don't understand why it used to
work, though....).  The FORTRAN code now compiles with g77 (with some
harmless warnings about format statements that aren't ever used).

Sorry for so many postings lately.

Using .62, when I tried to use save.plot(), I found it didn't work any
more, and that I was supposed to use dev.copy() instead. But it doesn't
work the same way as save.plot did:
dev.copy("filename.ps")
doesn't work. It doesn't have any help, and I couldn't figure out how to
make it work by looking at its definition. (I tried stuff like device=x11
or device=2)

Thanks for any help!

I think the function you want is "dev.print".  It starts the
postscript device driver and then does a dev.copy of the
current picture to it.  By default, the plot is saved in
"Rplots.ps", but you can change that as follows:

	dev.print(file="fig3.eps")

You can also specify other arguments to "postscript"

	dev.print(file="pic.eps", height=3, width=4, pointsize=10)

I will be documenting this stuff, and  writing a wysiwyg hardcopy
gadget as well.

In practice and 0.62, it is there, but called --enable-readline.
I.e.

	./configure --enable-readline		# use readline
	./configure --enable-readline=yes	# use readline

	./configure --enable-readline=no	# don't use it

Bill,
 thank you for all the good questions on R.
They *are* helpful for improvement of code and/or documentation
and useful to other R users.

Just one note however:

  Questions on "snapshot code" (i.e., currently R 0.62)
  which do not apply to the released code (R 0.61.x currently)

  *really* should NOT go to R-help at all.
  Using snapshot code is meant for users who are considering themselves
  ``fit for R-devel''.
  Actually, some of these questions should probably only go to R-core.
  In your case, the documentation for the "dev.xxx" functions has been on
  our todo list for a while..
	

Best (and yes, keep these messages coming!),

Subject: R-beta: Not loading C library
Message-ID: <351FD4CA.798F14@kiefte.v-wave.com>

I've been using R for the last few weeks, but not with much success. If
I try sourcing test.R from the 'class' package, I get this error:
Error in .C("VR_knn1", as.integer(ntr), as.integer(nte), as.integer(p),
: C/Fortran function not in load table
I checked the class.so file, and sure enough VR_knn1 is there. Why can't
R find it?
By the way, I'm running RedHat Linux, and downloaded the .rpm from
lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/bin/i386-linux/RedHat-5.0/R-base-0.61.2-1.i386.rpm

Any help would be appreciated.

Dear Michael Kiefte, 

as a happy (very new) user of R (thanks to everyone involved in
writing this fine package- it's great!), all I could find out was that
with the latest (?) _alpha_ version, for reasons unintelligible to me
(sorry), the .../R-snapshot/library/class/R/class file lacks a line
like

    library.dynam("class.so")

at its very end. With this line included, the test.R from the class
package works like a charm on my ELF Linux-2.0.91/GLIBC-2.1x box;
otherwise, I see the error message you have described. Obviously, this
is not a topic for the R-_beta_ discussion list, forgive me for having
mentioned it here...

In R-0.61.2 (compiled out of the box, that is, from the gzipped tar
file), the last line of the R code for the class package in
.../R-0.61.2/library/class/R/class is

    library.dynam("class", package = "class")

For this version, the test.R file produces a nice graphical
output without any changes...

Best regards, 

Ernst

Hi again,
I've localized the problem with the library.dynam('class') function in the
class package.
If I restart R in a directory containing .RData from a session in which I
previously used the 'class' library, I get the VR_knn not in library table
error. If there is no .RData file, then it works fine. What is in the
.RData file that's causing this error?
Thanks to everyone who responded the last time!
