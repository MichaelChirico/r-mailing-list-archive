Subject: [R] Data Issues with ctree/glm and controlling classification
	parameters
Message-ID: <CAHVFrXH0xtnFnQcjUVVeCLCOnW8OLyurpb0OrAp+4t+LYND0Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a dataset obtained as:

mydata <- read.csv("data.csv", header = TRUE) which contains the variable
'y' (y is binary 0 or 1) and also another variable 'weight' (weight is a
numerical variable - taking fractional values between 0 and 1).

1>
I want to first apply ctree() on  mydata, but dont want to use this
'weight' variable in the tree-buiding process. Can you please suggest how
to do this? Please note, I *don't* want to delete/remove this variable from
mydata.


2>
Another question: Say, I split up mydata into train (80%) and test(20%) as:
d<-sort(sample(nrow(mydata), nrow(mydata)*0.8));
train <- mydata[d,];
test < -mydata[-d,];


Then, I perform weighted glm (essentially, logistic regression) on train as:
#Build GLM model on train data
model <-glm(y~., data = train, weights = train$weight, family = binomial);
********************(A)
#Apply model on test
score <-predict(model, type = 'response',test); **************(B)
#Get classification for each observation in test as 'positive' or 'negative'
classify <-performance(score,"tpr","fpr"); **************(C)

My question here is:
2a> Again, how do I proceed if I don't want to use the variable 'weight' as
a regressor in the glm() function in (A) above (but use all other variables
in train)?
2b> In step (B) & (C), how do I control the classification rule, i.e. R
might classify observations with model-fitted probability > 0.5 as a
'positive' and <= 0.5 as a 'negative'. Is there a way I can change this
threshold to say, 0.75 instead of whatever R might be using (I used 0.5 as
example).

Thank you in advance for your help.

Subject: [R] CTree to obtain segmented data
Message-ID: <CAHVFrXHNVfYX1=+ZTFECSz46g=Hv05FQpybdD=ynQ4D-bk5j8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I have a dataset obtained as:
mydata <- read.csv("data.csv", header = TRUE) which contains the variable
'y' (y is binary 0 or 1) and some regressor variables.
I want to apply the ctree technique on this data with the following
requirements:
1> Of course I would need the tree plot (which I can do myself)
2> After that, I would need the segmented subsets of the data (as
determined by running ctree()) in array format, i.e. if ctree partitions
mydata into 6 smaller datasets, I need to output an array 'CTree_Subsets'
with 6 elements, each element being one of these smaller datasets. Note
that I need the actual smaller datasets in the array, and not just their
characteristics/classification rules obtained from the tree. (Context: I'll
need to run separate logistic regression models for each of these smaller
datasets). Would really appreciate your help with this issue

Thanks,
Preetam

It's a package,  .... not a library.

I see that I mispled that _package_ name. However, after loading it I realized that I had no way of replicating what you are seeing, because you didn't provide that file (or even something that resembles it. It's rather unclear how you wanted this information presented.

Hi jpm miao,
I think you can get what you want like this:

alpha1<-sample(LETTERS[1:3],50,TRUE)
alpha2<-sample(LETTERS[1:2],50,TRUE)
alphas<-data.frame(alpha1,alpha2)
library(prettyR)
alphatab<-xtab(alpha1~alpha2,alphas)
sink("temp_table3.csv",append=TRUE)
delim.xtab(alphatab,pct=NA,delim=",")
sink()

Hi Lars,
A mystery, but for the bodgy characters in your error message. Perhaps
there is a problem with R trying to read a different character set
from that used in the package.

Hi,

I think you need to check the order of your arguments to rasterize().  See the documentation with ?rasterize and compare to what you did below.

Never let it be said there's only one way to do a thing:

require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)

#create a sample dataset
dat <- data.frame(y1=sample(c(1:10,NA),20,replace=TRUE),
                          y2=sample(c(1:10,NA),20,replace=TRUE),
                          y3=sample(c(1:10,NA),20,replace=TRUE))

# convert from wide to long
dat <- melt(dat)

# add the counts as a label
dat <- merge(dat,
          group_by(dat,variable) %>%
               summarise(lab=paste0('n=',length(na.omit(value)))))

# do the plot
ggplot(dat,aes(x=variable,y=value)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_text(aes(y=max(value,na.rm=TRUE)/2,label=lab))

Actually not sure my previous answer does what you wanted. Using your
approach:

 t2pd=subset(df,grepl("t2",df$Command) & grepl("pd",df$Command))

Should work.

I think the regex pattern you are looking for is:

 Subset(df,grepl("(.* t2.*pd.* )|(.* pd.* t2.*)",df$Command)

But require() should not be used interchangeably with library()... the return value from require() should always be tested.

Fantastic - that does the trick! Easy when you know how!! 

Follow-on: is there a way feed all the lists from ds2 to vioplot? It is now a series of lists (rather than a dataframe - is that right?). So this works, 

library(vioplot)
ds1 = read.csv("http://www.lecturematerials.co.uk/data/spelling.csv")
ds2 <- lapply( ds1, na.omit)
vioplot(ds2$y1,ds2$y2)

but this doesnt

library(vioplot)
ds1 = read.csv("http://www.lecturematerials.co.uk/data/spelling.csv")
ds2 <- lapply( ds1, na.omit)
vioplot(ds2)

>>> 2. Can I easily add the sample size to each violin plotted??

The original code *should* have worked as the csv was online. There doesnt seem to be any option in vioplot to add the sample size (these are all small samples which I wanted to highlight) so I dont know if this is easily done elsewhere.

Thanks again!!

Error in min(data) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument


I had trouble, too. I thought, "Oh, this is easy, just use `do.call`", but I failed in getting any successful argument passing that way. 

> do.call('vioplot', list(x=ds2[[6]], ds2[-6]) )
Error in min(data) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument
> do.call('vioplot', c(x=ds2[[6]], ds2[-6]) )
Error in vioplot(x1 = 5L, x2 = 10L, x3 = 6L, x4 = 7L, x5 = 7L, x6 = 6L,  : 
  argument "x" is missing, with no default

Eventually I re-wrote the first line of vioplot's body to behave the way I thought made the most sense:

 vioplot <- 
function (x, ..., range = 1.5, h = NULL, ylim = NULL, names = NULL, 
    horizontal = FALSE, col = "magenta", border = "black", lty = 1, 
    lwd = 1, rectCol = "black", colMed = "white", pchMed = 19, 
    at, add = FALSE, wex = 1, drawRect = TRUE) 
{
    datas <- c(list(x), ...)
# .... but keep the rest the same.

# I then get success with:

vioplot(ds2[['y1']], ds2[-6])  # success

do.call('vioplot', list(x=ds2[[6]], ds2[-6]) ) # also successes
do.call('vioplot', list(x=ds2[['y1']], ds2[-6]) )

This is retracing a route explored 8 years ago:

http://markmail.org/search/?q=list%3Aorg.r-project.r-help+list+argument+to+vioplot#query:list%3Aorg.r-project.r-help%20list%20argument%20to%20vioplot+page:1+mid:j6lapgri46utcod7+state:results


It's probably easier to use that helper-function approach than my efforts at hacking.

Best of luck;

Dear Dennis,

Thank you for your reply. I can use the dplyr/data.table packages to
aggregate - its the matching FIPS codes to their states that I am having
trouble. Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Message-ID: <CAHby=D2x+7FKocM4gSpwks3_0PZN16pjMz4rz3v6cqN76_w1Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello dear R users,

Is there a function or package which can insert row, column or array in
another array at specified place (row or column)?

I have made several attempts at this function optimizing both speed, code
readability and ease of use. The functions are of following format:

appcol=function(original_array, inserted_object, column_number,
overwrite=FALSE)

# If overwrite=TRUE the columns after column_number are ovewritten by
inserted_object else the columns after column_number are shifted.

Now I have started using package dplyr and it seams that there is no
inserting function either. One can only append at the end or at the
beginning of tbl_df. Is it true?

Hello dear R helpers,

Is it possible to have more than 1 row for column names in data.frame,
array, tbl_df? I would like to have column numbers in the first row, string
names in the second row, physical unit in third row.
How would I do it?

I think what you ask isn't ideal.Each column in a dataframe should be the
same data type. While column names are stored in the first row when the df
is exported to CSV, they are not stored as columns in the data frame.
Instead the column names are stored as a separate attribute of the df. This
is why you need to use names(df) to access them, not df[1,]. I don't have
access to R right now, but I think ?attributes or ??"attributes" should
point you in the correct direction.

If you can address your columns by name then order shouldn't matter. If the
column order does matter, perhaps a matrix is a better structure to use?

So post some example code that demonstrate you paid attention to the answer given. Both dplyr and data.table not limited for aggregation. They do several versions of matching. So does the base function `merge`. We do not yet know what sort of efforts you have made. r-help at r-project.org is not an online code-writing service.

It's possible to embed "\n" in names but whether that will deliver desired results with plotting and printing functions may be another matter. You would always  need to quote names, even when using "$".

This does not offer code, only the list of formals. If you want help with coding, then you should provide some. I remember a posting by Gabor Grothendieck on StackOverflow (where he cited another blogger) where he demonstrated how to implement a postfix "+" function like that of C, that I _think_ might address this question but without a MWE and desired result I cannot do any testing.

Probably not. There's always:

I have some angle data from an animal behavior study that I would like to plot for publication using ggplot2. What follows is my current workflow with some example data.

### BEGIN SCRIPT ###

### Create two data frames of random Cartesian coordinates ###
df1 <- data.frame(
x = sample(10, 11, replace = TRUE),
y = sample(10, 11, replace = TRUE))

df2 <- data.frame(
x = sample(10, 11, replace = TRUE),
y = sample(10, 11, replace = TRUE))

### Write a function that converts continuous Cartesian coordinates to velocities ###
get.polar <- function(df)
{
x <- diff(df$x)
y <- diff(df$y)
d <- complex(real = x, imaginary = y)
steps <- data.frame(speed = Mod(d), angle = Arg(d))
steps[-1,] # Deletes the first row as it does not contain an angle measurement
steps$time <- (1:nrow(steps))/30 # generates a time column in seconds (1 data point = 1/30 of a second)
return(steps)
}

df1_polar <- get.polar(df1)
df2_polar <- get.polar(df2)

require(circular)

### Convert angles into an object of type 'circular' ###
df1_rad <- circular(df1_polar$angle, type = 'angles', units = 'radians', zero=0, rotation = "counter")
df2_rad <- circular(df2_polar$angle, type = 'angles', units = 'radians', zero=0, rotation = "counter")

### Convert radians to degrees with a clockwise rotation and zero at "north" ###
df1_deg <- conversion.circular(df1_rad, type = "angles", units = "degrees", zero = pi/2, rotation = "clock")
df2_deg <- conversion.circular(df2_rad, type = "angles", units = "degrees", zero = pi/2, rotation = "clock")

Some suggestions for turning this rough plot into something publishable using ggplot2?

Thank you!

Subject: [R] Retrieving response variable in the probit
Message-ID: <CAKTtY6TXEW8c1M0oTNVgfeP-_uqVrVP9e06u+QFmoZrBdyTphQ@mail.gmail.com>

Can anyone tell me how to retrieve the response (dependent) variable
from a probit regression object (as much as model.matrix(obj)
retrieves the data matrix). Below is a self-runnable set of codes.
Thank you!

library(sampleSelection)
data<-read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/220037024/Yen/data/pta.csv")
eq1<-d~sex+age+educ
p1<-probit(eq1,data=data)
summary(p1)

Subject: [R] Order of bars w geom_errorbarh ??
Message-ID: <CAOrp6CfNCNXBYLyVgUC1-qB6M9KHKbXZ96wbCCNuqZDRpE7T_w@mail.gmail.com>

Using geom_errorbarh with ggplot, my plot has several error bars.   For my
presentation, the order of these bars from top to bottom is important.
But errorbarh seems to put these in a random order I can't change.  ( It
does not follow the order in the data.frame. )    How can I specify the
order of the bars?   Could I also specify the thickness of the bar lines?

Hi

You can use rbind, cbind but you need to be aware of what objects you are binding together.

mm<-matrix(rnorm(12), 3,4)
> rbind(mm[1:2,], 1:4, mm[3,])
           [,1]       [,2]       [,3]       [,4]
[1,] -0.2029407 -1.5910628 -0.2582281 -0.1649921
[2,] -0.6913951  0.3591561  0.8236836 -0.3592203
[3,]  1.0000000  2.0000000  3.0000000  4.0000000
[4,] -0.2096650 -2.3671913 -0.4444438  0.3846274

Anyway, you can append rows/columns and perform sort/order afterwards if you consider ordering important.

Cheers
Petr

Yes, that's right.  So after all the above was not really
perfect :

  na.omit() has been designed as a generic function and has always
  had a method for "data.frame"; so, really

    ds.noNA <- na.omit(ds1)
or  ds0NA   <- na.omit(ds1)

(choosing "expressive names")

is what you want.

model.frame(p1)

recovers the (possibly transformed) data employed for fitting the model 
and

model.response(model.frame(p1))

extracts the response variable from that model frame.

Hi jpm miao,
After a fair stretch of fooling around with it, I can't see any way to
add the variable names ("varnames") to the output of delim.table
without breaking it for things other than table objects. You can
probably do this as a one-off hack by setting the names of the
dimnames of the "counts" element in alphatab like this:

names(dimnames(alphatab$counts))<-alphatab$varnames

You can then shoehorn these into the output by adding a line to
display the second varname above the table and add the first varname
to the row of value labels. That's the best I can do at the moment.

Jim

Thanks for your reply tom. After using  Subset(df,grepl("(.*t2.*pd.*)|(.*pd.*t2.*)"),df$Command)  I get this error: Argument "x" is missing, with no default. Actually I don't know how to fix this. Do you have any idea?
Thanks,

Actually not sure my previous answer does what you wanted. Using your approach:
 t2pd=subset(df,grepl("t2",df$Command) & grepl("pd",df$Command))
Should work.
I think the regex pattern you are looking for is:
 Subset(df,grepl("(.* t2.*pd.* )|(.* pd.* t2.*)",df$Command)

Tom's code was missing a ")" but not where you put one. He probably also didn't intend to capitalize "subset".

Subject: [R] Order of bars w geom_errorbarh ??

Ordering of any discrete values in ggplot goes according to the levels of the factor. As a convenience, ggplot will convert character values into factor for you according to the default order alphabetical). To take control of this you have to convert your discrete columns to factors yourself before giving the data to ggplot, e.g.

DF$somecol  <- factor( DF$somecol, levels=c("level1","level2",...) )

However, if you pull data from different factors in different input tables, ggplot has to combine them internally, and you will lose your specified ordering. With no minimum reproducible example I cannot tell whether that is a problem for you,  but the solution would be to combine them yourself before you give them to ggplot.

Martin et. al.:

na.omit(frame) will remove all rows/cases in which an NA occurs.  I'm
not sure that this is what the OP wanted, which seemed to be to
separately remove NA's from each column and plot the resulting column.
This is what the lapply (and the OP's provided code) does, anyway.

Also, lapply() produces a single list (of vectors), not a "series of lists" .

Corrections happily accepted if I'm in error.

Cheers,
Bert

Don't know if this would help, but you could always set an attribute
of alphatab to be the dimnames. See ?attrib . Of course you would then
have to write a custom print() function, possibly along the lines you
indicated.

You could also do this via S3 (or whatever) classes, of course. But
again, none of this may be the sort of thing the OP could handle.
Maybe my point is by improving her(?) R programming skills, she would
gain the ability to do all sorts of such "customizations".

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] Rserve() error in the first instance of running a Java
	application
Message-ID: <C32C152F-ED73-4B77-A4C1-4D0BBABC0BC5@gmail.com>

Hi, 

I am writing a Java GUI application which uses Rserve(). I have a java script which sends a command to the shell to start Rserve(). When I run the Java main method for the very first time, it calls this script to invoke Rserve() and starts Rserve(). But, in this first run the Java GUI application is not launched. But, when I run the main method for the second time, I get the following message and the GUI application is launched. 

##> SOCK_ERROR: bind error #48(address already in use)

I do not understand this behaviour. From what I can understand, in the first run, the script just establishes the Rserve() connection and then in the second run it works. Can someone help me fix this, so that program connects to Rserve() in the first instance and also launches the GUI?

Here my Java class containing the method to invoke Rserve():

public class InvokeRserve {
    public static int invoke() {
        String s;

        try {

            // run the Unix "ps -ef" command
            // using the Runtime exec method:
            Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("R CMD RServe --vanilla");

            BufferedReader stdInput = new BufferedReader(new
                    InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));

            BufferedReader stdError = new BufferedReader(new
                    InputStreamReader(p.getErrorStream()));

            // read the output from the command
            System.out.println("Here is the standard output of the command:\n");
            while ((s = stdInput.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(s);
            }

            // read any errors from the attempted command
            System.out.println("Here is the standard error of the command (if any):\n");
            while ((s = stdError.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(s);
            }

            //  System.exit(0);

        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("exception happened - here's what I know: ");
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(-1);
        }
        return 1;
    }


Here is the main method which calls the invoke() method:

public class Application {
    /**
     * Main method for the Swing application
     *
     * @param args
     * @throws Exception
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        // Start Rserve()
        int value = InvokeRserve.invoke();

        if(value == 1) {
            // Run the GUI construction in the Event-Dispatching thread for thread-safety
            SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {

                /**
                 * run method which create a new GUIMain object
                 */
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    new GUIMain(?Data Analysis Application?); // Let the constructor do the job
                }
            });
        }
    }
}

Subject: [R] Network Layouting in R
Message-ID: <4b8726c399d1f4fbd4ed916623cd2def@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



I am trying to plot a network diagram of around 1500 component (as nodes)
and many connections (as edges) within them.



I tried igraph package, however unable to create a layout where there is no
overlap of nodes or edges.



More or less tried all the things mentioned in this link -

http://kateto.net/network-visualization



Can you please suggest how to do it in R ?



Output expected ? A good layout of the network diagram (of around 1500
nodes) with no overlaps of nodes or even edges and possibly it can be
screened as a picture, or on a browser or on a pdf.



With Best Regards,

Kushank

Thanks Peter, you were right, the exact grepl is grepl("(.*t2.*pd.*)|(.*pd.*t2.*)",df$Command), but it does not change anything in Command, when I check the size of it by sum(grepl("(.*t2.*pd.*)|(.*pd.*t2.*)",df$Command))  the result is 0, but I am sure that the size is not 0. It seems that this AND does not work.

Tom's code was missing a ")" but not where you put one. He probably also didn't intend to capitalize "subset".

How do you know it's physically possible to create a 2D layout with no overlap?
1500 nodes is a lot.

What did you try? What did you get? Did you produce a diagram, just
with more overlap than you were expecting? That may be the best you
can do.

Again, what did you try? What did you get that doesn't meet your
needs? Just the overlap? Again, that may be unavoidable. Note the
comment from that link:
"One thing to emphasize though is that in many cases, visualizing
larger networks as giant hairballs is less helpful than providing
charts that show key characteristics of the graph."

> Can you please suggest how to do it in R ?

For working with largish graph layouts, I've had more success with
gephi than R, although I believe you can duplicate most of the gephi
functionality in R.

Thanks Jim. I don't think that is the issue...if anyone else can shed some
light here, that would be much appreciated.

Sorry for the missed braces earlier. I was typing on a phone, not the best
place to conjugate regular expressions.
Using the example you provided:

"_abdomen_t1_seq", "knee_pd_t1_localize", "pd_local_abdomen_t2"))

Hello Lara,

I recently installed a number of packages through compiling. After
downloading the package using 'wget', running R CMD INSTALL package.tar.gz
should work.

Sincerely,

Shouro

Yes it works, but let me explain what I am going to do. I extract all the names I want and then create a new column out of them for my plot. This is he whole thing I do:
  PD=subset(df,grepl("pd",Command)) //extract names in Command with only "pd"
  t2=subset(df,grepl("t2",Command)) //extract names with only "t2"
  PDT2=subset(df,grepl("(.*t2.*pd.*)|(.*pd.*t2.*)",df$Command) // extract names which contain both "pd" and "t2"
  v1=c('PD','t2','PDT2')// I create a vector with these conditions
  str_extract(df$Command,paste(v1,collaps='|')) //returning patterns, using stringr library

here I see no pattern named PDT2 but there are only PD and t2 patterns.

The first thing I notice here is that your first two subset statements are
searching in an object named Command, not the column df$Command. I'm not at
all sure what you are trying to achieve with the str_extract process but it
is looking for the exact string 'PDT2' the vectors / dataframe formed in
your previous commands are not being used at all.
Moving forward I think you need to pay attention to case "PD" != "pd". Also
the set PDT2 is going to be a subset of both  sets PD and t2, I don't think
this is what you are after.

Thanks, John.

The trouble with that solution is that it gives the index for where the
cursor was before clicking rather than the cell that was clicked. The
solution is that the <Button-1> binding gives the x, y pixel coordinates of
the click to the callback, and the pixel coordinates can be translated to
cell index via:

tkindex(table1, as.tclObj(paste0("@",x, ",", y)))

Or, showing the whole example:

# create table
tt<-tktoplevel()
table1<-tkwidget(tt,"table", rows=3,cols=3)
tkgrid(table1)

# bind the mouse click to printing out cell index:
tkbind(table1, "<Button-1>", function(x, y) print(tcl(table1, "index",
as.tclObj(paste0("@",x, ",", y)))))

Thanks again!

-Dan

Subject: [R] Can't rename a data frame column
Message-ID: <CABcx46CBgeTjJpiD1cCz_rTnFLP49ukwxJ4ip-n+Rcwzq2wRwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

   Could someone suggest a way to rename a data frame column? For example,
I want to rename the column beta, but I can't do it this way

> d <- data.frame(alpha=1:3, beta=4:6, gamma=7:9)
> mm<-"beta"
> rename(d, c(mm="two", "gamma"="three"))
The following `from` values were not present in `x`: mm
  alpha beta three
1     1    4     7
2     2    5     8
3     3    6     9

********
     Of course this would work

> rename(d, c("beta"="two", "gamma"="three"))
  alpha two three
1     1   4     7
2     2   5     8
3     3   6     9

No corrections needed.  You were right ... and indeed I was
wrong in assuming that "one would want"  a complete  na.omit()
here.

Dear all,I am trying to write in my Figure labels short equations that contain greek characters

For example:??C(h) = sigma^2 * rho(h). ??

I am googling it and there are many packages available but unfortunately they do not look available for my 3.2.4 latex version

install.packages("latex2expr")Installiere Paket nach ?/home/apa/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2?(da ?lib? nicht spezifiziert)Warnung: kann nicht auf den Index f?r das Repository https://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu/src/contrib zugreifen:? nicht unterst?tztes URL SchemaWarnmeldung:Paket ?latex2expr? ist nicht verf?gbar (for R version 3.2.4 Revised)?

Any ideas what else I can try?I would like to thank you in advance for your replyRegardsAlex

Googling about R problems often does not lead to the best
solutions.

In this case do

   ?plotmath

and see that you do *NOT* need to install any extra packages.
You do have 29 R packages installed with your R installation,
you already have several 1000s R functions at your
disposition....

You need to learn about proper subsetting, and the names() function. Consider the following:

R > d <- data.frame(alpha=1:3, beta=4:6, gamma=7:9)
R > d
  alpha beta gamma
1     1    4     7
2     2    5     8
3     3    6     9
R > names(d)
[1] "alpha" "beta"  "gamma"
R > names(d) == "beta"
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE
R > names(d)[names(d) == "beta"] <- "two"
R > d
  alpha two gamma
1     1   4     7
2     2   5     8
3     3   6     9

R > names(d)[3] <- "three"
R > d
  alpha two three
1     1   4     7
2     2   5     8
3     3   6     9

I just changed all the names in Command to lowercase, then this str_extract works fine for "pd" and "t2", but not for "PDT2". Do you have any idea how I can bring PDT2  also in str_extract?

The first thing I notice here is that your first two subset statements are searching in an object named Command, not the column df$Command. I'm not at all sure what you are trying to achieve with the str_extract process but it is looking for the exact string 'PDT2' the vectors / dataframe formed in your previous commands are not being used at all. 
Moving forward I think you need to pay attention to case "PD" != "pd". Also the set PDT2 is going to be a subset of both  sets PD and t2, I don't think this is what you are after.

Looking at ??grepl, I see the option: ignore.case=TRUE?

 PDT2=subset(df,grepl("(.*t2.*pd.*)|(.*pd.*t2.*)",df$
Command,ignore.case=TRUE)

Perhaps this will do the trick.

Message-ID: <c2426a26544549429a2424c5a05c65c9@ex13-live-mbn1.ad.kent.ac.uk>

Dear R users,

I am trying to generate a 3D plot using the wireframe() function in the lattice package.

The corresponding formula in Excel looks as follows and is applied to the wireframe() function:

MIN(psi/K14,EXP(((ABS(H14)/peak)^omega)*LN(psi/K14)))

I tried to "translate" this formula in R and the code looks as follows


min(psi/VaR,exp(((abs(B)/Bmax)^w2)*log((psi/VaR),2.718182)))



In this case I get only one value which is NAN but I should get a time series with 13000 values. Hence, I deleted the min() function and tried the wireframe() function:


wireframe(inflator~exp((abs(B)/Bmax)^w2)*log((psi/VaR),base=2.718182),data=data_3Dplot)

However, it doesn't work as the formula for the inflator is incorrect. It produces NANs although it shouldn't do that and actually doesn't do that in Excel. Furthermore, the results are totally different to those calculated by Excel.

Can anyone help me with the formula and translate it correctly in terms of R? How do I get the time series? How do I get the values I get in Excel?

I have attached the data as csv file to this email.

Thank you very much for your help.

Dear R users,
I am trying to backtest VaR using the rugarch package. My code looks as follows

VaRTest(alpha=0.025,Backtesting_BuVaR$Log.return,Backtesting_BuVaR$VaR,conf.level = 0.975)

R returns following output. I don't understand why I get NAs except for the critical values.
Does anyone have an idea what I am doing wrong and why R returns only NAs? The corresponding data are in the csv file.

Many thanks for your support.

For starters, use 'pmin' (parallel min) instead of 'min'.

substitute(MIN(psi/K14,EXP(((ABS(H14)/peak)^omega)*LN(psi/K14))),
     list(MIN=quote(pmin), K14=quote(VaR), ABS=quote(abs),
          EXP=quote(exp), LN=quote(log), H14=quote(Bmax),

# pmin(psi/VaR, exp(((abs(Bmax)/peak)^w2) * log(psi/VaR)))

Please try to read my earlier comments.
In the absence of a proper example with expected output I think what you
are trying to achieve is:

# create a sample dataframe
df <- data.frame(Command=c("_localize_PD", "_localize_tre_t2",
"_abdomen_t1_seq", "knee_pd_t1_localize", "pd_local_abdomen_t2"))

# identify which rows in the dataframe set match the patterns
# note, the vectors PD, T2 and PDT2 are booleans indicating if a match was
made
PD <- grepl("pd", df$Command)
T2 <- grepl('t2', df$Command)
PDT2 <- grepl("(.*t2.*pd.*)|(.*pd.*t2.*)", df$Command)

# create the new column to hold the new names
df$new_name <- NA

df[PD,'new_name'] <- 'pd'
df[T2,'new_name'] <- 't2'
df[PDT2,'new_name'] <- 'pdt2'


# note 1: the order of these command is important, if the last command is
run first all matches will be overwritten by the single matches for 't2'
and 'pd'.
# note 2: There is no match for row 1 as "PD" != "pd", as suggested by John
McKown the ignore.case parameter for grepl can be used to change this
behaviour.

My efforts found a 'latex2exp' but no 'latex2expr'. Are you sure you are not missplelling the package name?

Subject: [R] Accessing terminal datasets in Ctree()
Message-ID: <CAHVFrXEc7azk6F5+qpNQVHkTGQ_NSj1OUFaDkxHdLMqkZh4iJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

If I am applying ctree() on a data (specifying some control parameters like
maxdepth), is there a way I can programmatically access the (smaller)
datasets corresponding to the terminal nodes in the tree? Say, if there are
7 terminal nodes, I need those 7 datasets (of course, I can look at the
respective node-splitting attributes and write out a filtering function -
but clearly too much to ask for if I have a large number of terminal
nodes). Intention is to perform regression on each of these terminal
datasets.

Regards,
Preetam

If you use the "partykit" implementation you can do:

library("partykit")
ct <- ctree(Species ~ ., data = iris)
data_party(ct, id = 6)

to obtain the data associated with node 6 for example. You can also use 
ct[6] to obtain the subtree and ct[6]$data for its associated data.

For setting up a factor with the terminal node IDs, you can also use 
predict(ct, type = "node") and then use that in lm() etc.

Finally, note that there is also lmtree() and glmtree() for trees with 
(generalized) linear models in their nodes.

Great, thank you so much Achim.
But one issue, in case I do not know how many terminal nodes would be
there, what do I do? Note that I do not need the datasets corresponding to
the intermediate nodes only need the terminal datasets.

Preetam

With predict(ct, type = "node") you can set up a new variable, e.g.,

iris$node <- factor(predict(ct, type = "node"))

and then use this to obtain the subset corresponding to each of the 
terminal nodes.

What nonsense.  There is a group of finger-waggers on this list who jump on every poster who uses the name of an R function as a variable name.  R is perfectly capable of distinguishing the two, so if 'c' (or 'data' or 'df', etc.) is the natural name for a variable then go ahead and use it.  Mr. Newmiller provides an excellent example of this:  he recommends 'C' instead of 'c', apparently without realizing that 'C' is also a built-in R function--because there is "no such problem".

"c" an extremely commonly-used function. Functions are first-class objects that occupy the same namespaces that variables do, so they can obscure each other. In short, don't use variables called "c" (R is case sensitive, so "C" has no such problem).

Wherever possible, avoid incremental concatenation like the plague. If you feel you must use it, at least concatenate in lists and then use functions like unlist, do.call, or pre-allocate vectors or matrix-like objects with unuseful values like NA and then overwrite each element in the vector or matrix-type object in a loop like your first one.

As pointed out somewhere in the replies to this you can always use the
exists() function.
for(i in 1:5){
    if(exists(output)){
        output <- c(output, i )
    }else{
       output <- i
   }
}

You are quite wrong.  This is not "nonsense"; it is sound advice.  It is 
true that R is capable of distinguishing between a function and a 
non-function object with the same name.  However there are many 
circumstances in which using a function's name for the name of a data 
object will lead to errors in function calls and the resulting error 
messages will be difficult to interpret.  (Things like "object of type 
'builtin' is not subsettable".)

Indulging in using "c" (e.g.) for the name of a data object is bad 
practice and mental laziness.

I would suggest that you restrain your presumptuousness and arrogance, 
and refrain from telling experienced and wise R gurus, like Jeff 
Newmiller, that their ideas are "nonsense" until you have a little more 
experience with and knowledge of R.

I am sure that you will insist on arguing about this and that you will 
continue to claim that black is white, but the fact remains that you are 
wrong.  Others should pay no attention to your ranting.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hi,

   I am trying to print several dataset in several different sheets of the
same xlsx file.
I sometimes run the codes more than once, and I need to erase all things in
the target file, and I do not use "append" in the first function call.
However I want to write it in a loop. Is there a way to initiate a blank
xlsx file so that I can use "append = TRUE" whenever I call the function
write.xlsx2?

output_file2<-"data_xx.xlsx"
write.xlsx2(x= df_all2[["a"]], file = output_file2, sheetName = "a")
write.xlsx2(x= df_all2[["b"]], file = output_file2, sheetName = "b",
append=TRUE)
write.xlsx2(x= df_all2[["c"]], file = output_file2, sheetName = "c",
append= TRUE)

I'm not sure what you are trying to do...

Have you checked what the output of d[c("b","c")] is? And what about the 
output of identical(d[c("b","c")],c(4,10)) ? As is, I don't see the 
point of going through identical(). Maybe you're looking for which() or 
"%in%"?

If you just want to subset the second row, and second and third columns, 
then just do it! In your code, you forgot to subset for the rows... Here 
is an idea:
d[2, c("b","c")]
You can also use the function subset() as Ulrik has shown you.

HTH,
Ivan

Not sure this is what you need or the best way to do it, but you could 
do something along these lines:

#first create a file name that depends on which file names already 
exist. The big thing here is list.files() but you probably need to adapt 
the rest to your needs:
fileNumber <- list.files(pattern="xxx")
fileName <- paste0("xxx", length(fileNumber)+1 , ".xlsx")

#then write to xlsx in a loop:
for(i in ...){
   write.xlsx2(df_all2[[i]], file=fileName, sheetName=i, append=TRUE)
}

This works at least with xlsx::write.xlsx2(), with no error or warning 
even for when the file does not exist (first iteration)

HTH,
Ivan

CHANGES IN R 3.3.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * nchar(x, *)'s argument keepNA governing how the result for NAs in
      x is determined, gets a new default keepNA = NA which returns NA
      where x is NA, except for type = "width" which still returns 2,
      the formatting / printing width of NA.

    * All builds have support for https: URLs in the default methods
      for download.file(), url() and code making use of them.

      Unfortunately that cannot guarantee that any particular https:
      URL can be accessed.  For example, server and client have to
      successfully negotiate a cryptographic protocol (TLS/SSL, ...)
      and the server's identity has to be verifiable _via_ the
      available certificates.  Different access methods may allow
      different protocols or use private certificate bundles: we
      encountered a https: CRAN mirror which could be accessed by one
      browser but not by another nor by download.file() on the same
      Linux machine.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The print method for methods() gains a byclass argument.

    * New functions validEnc() and validUTF8() to give access to the
      validity checks for inputs used by grep() and friends.

    * Experimental new functionality for S3 method checking, notably
      isS3method().

      Also, the names of the R 'language elements' are exported as
      character vector tools::langElts.

    * str(x) now displays "Time-Series" also for matrix (multivariate)
      time-series, i.e. when is.ts(x) is true.

    * (Windows only) The GUI menu item to install local packages now
      accepts *.tar.gz files as well as *.zip files (but defaults to
      the latter).

    * New programmeR's utility function chkDots().

    * D() now signals an error when given invalid input, rather than
      silently returning NA.  (Request of John Nash.)

    * formula objects are slightly more "first class": e.g., formula()
      or new("formula", y ~ x) are now valid.  Similarly, for "table",
      "ordered" and "summary.table".  Packages defining S4 classes with
      the above S3/S4 classes as slots should be reinstalled.

    * New function strrep() for repeating the elements of a character
      vector.

    * rapply() preserves attributes on the list when how = "replace".

    * New S3 generic function sigma() with methods for extracting the
      estimated standard deviation aka "residual standard deviation"
      from a fitted model.

    * news() now displays R and package news files within the HTML help
      system if it is available.  If no news file is found, a visible
      NULL is returned to the console.

    * as.raster(x) now also accepts raw arrays x assuming values in
      0:255.

    * Subscripting of matrix/array objects of type "expression" is now
      supported.

    * type.convert("i") now returns a factor instead of a complex value
      with zero real part and missing imaginary part.

    * Graphics devices cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() now allow non-default
      values of the cairographics 'fallback resolution' to be set.

      This now defaults to 300 on all platforms: that is the default
      documented by cairographics, but apparently was not used by all
      system installations.

    * file() gains an explicit method argument rather than implicitly
      using getOption("url.method", "default").

    * Thanks to a patch from Tomas Kalibera, x[x != 0] is now typically
      faster than x[which(x != 0)] (in the case where x has no NAs, the
      two are equivalent).

    * read.table() now always uses the names for a named colClasses
      argument (previously names were only used when colClasses was too
      short). (In part, wish of PR#16478.)

    * (Windows only) download.file() with default method = "auto" and a
      ftps:// URL chooses "libcurl" if that is available.

    * The out-of-the box Bioconductor mirror has been changed to one
      using https://: use chooseBioCmirror() to choose a http:// mirror
      if required.

    * The data frame and formula methods for aggregate() gain a drop
      argument.

    * available.packages() gains a repos argument.

    * The undocumented switching of methods for url() on https: and
      ftps: URLs is confined to method = "default" (and documented).

    * smoothScatter() gains a ret.selection argument.

    * qr() no longer has a ... argument to pass additional arguments to
      methods.

    * [ has a method for class "table".

    * It is now possible (again) to replayPlot() a display list
      snapshot that was created by recordPlot() in a different R
      session.

      It is still not a good idea to use snapshots as a persistent
      storage format for R plots, but it is now not completely silly to
      use a snapshot as a format for transferring an R plot between two
      R sessions.

      The underlying changes mean that packages providing graphics
      devices (e.g., Cairo, RSvgDevice, cairoDevice, tikzDevice) will
      need to be reinstalled.

      Code for restoring snapshots was contributed by Jeroen Ooms and
      JJ Allaire.

      Some testing code is available at <URL:
      https://github.com/pmur002/R-display-list>.

    * tools::undoc(dir = D) and codoc(dir = D) now also work when D is
      a directory whose normalizePath()ed version does not end in the
      package name, e.g. from a symlink.

    * abbreviate() has more support for multi-byte character sets - it
      no longer removes bytes within characters and knows about Latin
      vowels with accents.  It is still only really suitable for (most)
      European languages, and still warns on non-ASCII input.

      abbreviate(use.classes = FALSE) is now implemented, and that is
      more suitable for non-European languages.

    * match(x, table) is faster (sometimes by an order of magnitude)
      when x is of length one and incomparables is unchanged, thanks to
      Peter Haverty (PR#16491).

    * More consistent, partly not back-compatible behavior of NA and
      NaN coercion to complex numbers, operations less often resulting
      in complex NA (NA_complex_).

    * lengths() considers methods for length and [[ on x, so it should
      work automatically on any objects for which appropriate methods
      on those generics are defined.

    * The logic for selecting the default screen device on OS X has
      been simplified: it is now quartz() if that is available even if
      environment variable DISPLAY has been set by the user.

      The choice can easily be overridden _via_ environment variable
      R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE.

    * On Unix-like platforms which support the getline C library
      function, system(*,intern = TRUE) no longer truncates (output)
      lines longer than 8192 characters, thanks to Karl Millar.
      (PR#16544)

    * rank() gains a ties.method = "last" option, for convenience (and
      symmetry).

    * regmatches(invert = NA) can now be used to extract both
      non-matched and matched substrings.

    * data.frame() gains argument fix.empty.names; as.data.frame.list()
      gets new cut.names, col.names and fix.empty.names.

    * plot(x ~ x, *) now warns that it is the same as plot(x ~ 1, *).

    * recordPlot() has new arguments load and attach to allow package
      names to be stored as part of a recorded plot.  replayPlot() has
      new argument reloadPkgs to load/attach any package names that
      were stored as part of a recorded plot.

    * S4 dispatch works within calls to .Internal(). This means
      explicit S4 generics are no longer needed for unlist() and
      as.vector().

    * Only font family names starting with "Hershey" (and not "Her" as
      before) are given special treatment by the graphics engine.

    * S4 values are automatically coerced to vector (via as.vector)
      when subassigned into atomic vectors.

    * findInterval() gets a left.open option.

    * The version of LAPACK included in the sources has been updated to
      3.6.0, including those 'deprecated' routines which were
      previously included.  _Ca_ 40 double-complex routines have been
      added at the request of a package maintainer.

      As before, the details of what is included are in
      src/modules/lapack/README and this now gives information on
      earlier additions.

    * tapply() has been made considerably more efficient without
      changing functionality, thanks to proposals from Peter Haverty
      and Suharto Anggono.  (PR#16640)

    * match.arg(arg) (the one-argument case) is faster; so is
      sort.int().  (PR#16640)

    * The format method for object_size objects now also accepts
      "binary" units such as "KiB" and e.g., "Tb".  (Partly from
      PR#16649.)

    * Profiling now records calls of the form foo::bar and some similar
      cases directly rather than as calls to <Anonymous>.  Contributed
      by Winston Chang.

    * New string utilities startsWith(x, prefix) and endsWith(x,
      suffix).  Also provide speedups for some grepl("^...",*) uses
      (related to proposals in PR#16490).

    * Reference class finalizers run at exit, as well as on garbage
      collection.

    * Avoid parallel dependency on stats for port choice and random
      number seeds.  (PR#16668)

    * The radix sort algorithm and implementation from data.table
      (forder) replaces the previous radix (counting) sort and adds a
      new method for order().  Contributed by Matt Dowle and Arun
      Srinivasan, the new algorithm supports logical, integer (even
      with large values), real, and character vectors.  It outperforms
      all other methods, but there are some caveats (see ?sort).

    * The order() function gains a method argument for choosing between
      "shell" and "radix".

    * New function grouping() returns a permutation that stably
      rearranges data so that identical values are adjacent.  The
      return value includes extra partitioning information on the
      groups.  The implementation came included with the new radix
      sort.

    * rhyper(nn, m, n, k) no longer returns NA when one of the three
      parameters exceeds the maximal integer.

    * switch() now warns when no alternatives are provided.

    * parallel::detectCores() now has default logical = TRUE on all
      platforms - as this was the default on Windows, this change only
      affects Sparc Solaris.

      Option logical = FALSE is now supported on Linux and recent
      versions of OS X (for the latter, thanks to a suggestion of Kyaw
      Sint).

    * hist() for "Date" or "POSIXt" objects would sometimes give
      misleading labels on the breaks, as they were set to the day
      before the start of the period being displayed.  The display
      format has been changed, and the shift of the start day has been
      made conditional on right = TRUE (the default).  (PR#16679)

    * R now uses a new version of the logo (donated to the R Foundation
      by RStudio).  It is defined in .svg format, so will resize
      without unnecessary degradation when displayed on HTML
      pages-there is also a vector PDF version.  Thanks to Dirk
      Eddelbuettel for producing the corresponding X11 icon.

    * New function .traceback() returns the stack trace which
      traceback() prints.

    * lengths() dispatches internally.

    * dotchart() gains a pt.cex argument to control the size of points
      separately from the size of plot labels.  Thanks to Michael
      Friendly and Milan Bouchet-Valat for ideas and patches.

    * as.roman(ch) now correctly deals with more diverse character
      vectors ch; also arithmetic with the resulting roman numbers
      works in more cases.  (PR#16779)

    * prcomp() gains a new option rank. allowing to directly aim for
      less than min(n,p) PC's.  The summary() and its print() method
      have been amended, notably for this case.

    * gzcon() gains a new option text, which marks the connection as
      text-oriented (so e.g. pushBack() works).  It is still always
      opened in binary mode.

    * The import() namespace directive now accepts an argument except
      which names symbols to exclude from the imports. The except
      expression should evaluate to a character vector (after
      substituting symbols for strings). See Writing R Extensions.

    * New convenience function Rcmd() in package tools for invoking R
      CMD tools from within R.

    * New functions makevars_user() and makevars_site() in package
      tools to determine the location of the user and site specific
      Makevars files for customizing package compilation.

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check has a new option --ignore-vignettes for use with
      non-Sweave vignettes whose VignetteBuilder package is not
      available.

    * R CMD check now by default checks code usage (_via_ codetools)
      with only the base package attached.  Functions from default
      packages other than base which are used in the package code but
      not imported are reported as undefined globals, with a suggested
      addition to the NAMESPACE file.

    * R CMD check --as-cran now also checks DOIs in package CITATION
      and Rd files.

    * R CMD Rdconv and R CMD Rd2pdf each have a new option
      --RdMacros=pkglist which allows Rd macros to be specified before
      processing.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * The previously included versions of zlib, bzip2, xz and PCRE have
      been removed, so suitable external (usually system) versions are
      required (see the 'R Installation and Administration' manual).

    * The unexported and undocumented Windows-only devices cairo_bmp(),
      cairo_png() and cairo_tiff() have been removed.  (These devices
      should be used as e.g. bmp(type = "cairo").)

    * (Windows only) Function setInternet2() has no effect and will be
      removed in due course.  The choice between methods "internal" and
      "wininet" is now made by the method arguments of url() and
      download.file() and their defaults can be set _via_ options.  The
      out-of-the-box default remains "wininet" (as it has been since R
      3.2.2).

    * [<- with an S4 value into a list currently embeds the S4 object
      into its own list such that the end result is roughly equivalent
      to using [[<-.  That behavior is deprecated.  In the future, the
      S4 value will be coerced to a list with as.list().

    * Package tools' functions package.dependencies(), pkgDepends(),
      etc are deprecated now, mostly in favor of package_dependencies()
      which is both more flexible and efficient.

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * Support for very old versions of valgrind (e.g., 3.3.0) has been
      removed.

    * The included libtool script (generated by configure) has been
      updated to version 2.4.6 (from 2.2.6a).

    * libcurl version 7.28.0 or later with support for the https
      protocol is required for installation (except on Windows).

    * BSD networking is now required (except on Windows) and so
      capabilities("http/ftp") is always true.

    * configure uses pkg-config for PNG, TIFF and JPEG where this is
      available.  This should work better with multiple installs and
      with those using static libraries.

    * The minimum supported version of OS X is 10.6 ('Snow Leopard'):
      even that has been unsupported by Apple since 2012.

    * The configure default on OS X is --disable-R-framework: enable
      this if you intend to install under /Library/Frameworks and use
      with R.app.

    * The minimum preferred version of PCRE has since R 3.0.0 been 8.32
      (released in Nov 2012).  Versions 8.10 to 8.31 are now deprecated
      (with warnings from configure), but will still be accepted until
      R 3.4.0.

    * configure looks for C functions __cospi, __sinpi and __tanpi and
      uses these if cospi _etc_ are not found.  (OS X is the main
      instance.)

    * (Windows) R is now built using gcc 4.9.3.  This build will
      require recompilation of at least those packages that include C++
      code, and possibly others.  A build of R-devel using the older
      toolchain will be temporarily available for comparison purposes.

      During the transition, the environment variable R_COMPILED_BY has
      been defined to indicate which toolchain was used to compile R
      (and hence, which should be used to compile code in packages).
      The COMPILED_BY variable described below will be a permanent
      replacement for this.

    * (Windows) A make and R CMD config variable named COMPILED_BY has
      been added.  This indicates which toolchain was used to compile R
      (and hence, which should be used to compile code in packages).

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The make macro AWK which used to be made available to files such
      as src/Makefile is no longer set.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The API call logspace_sum introduced in R 3.2.0 is now remapped
      as an entry point to Rf_logspace_sum, and its first argument has
      gained a const qualifier.  (PR#16470)

      Code using it will need to be reinstalled.

      Similarly, entry point log1pexp also defined in Rmath.h is
      remapped there to Rf_log1pexp

    * R_GE_version has been increased to 11.

    * New API call R_orderVector1, a faster one-argument version of
      R_orderVector.

    * When R headers such as R.h and Rmath.h are called from C++ code
      in packages they include the C++ versions of system headers such
      as <cmath> rather than the legacy headers such as <math.h>.
      (Headers Rinternals.h and Rinterface.h already did, and inclusion
      of system headers can still be circumvented by defining
      NO_C_HEADERS, including as from this version for those two
      headers.)

      The manual has long said that R headers should *not* be included
      within an extern "C" block, and almost all the packages affected
      by this change were doing so.

    * Including header S.h from C++ code would fail on some platforms,
      and so gives a compilation error on all.

    * The deprecated header Rdefines.h is now compatible with defining
      R_NO_REMAP.

    * The connections API now includes a function R_GetConnection()
      which allows packages implementing connections to convert R
      connection objects to Rconnection handles used in the API. Code
      which previously used the low-level R-internal getConnection()
      entry point should switch to the official API.

  BUG FIXES:

    * C-level asChar(x) is fixed for when x is not a vector, and it
      returns "TRUE"/"FALSE" instead of "T"/"F" for logical vectors.

    * The first arguments of .colSums() etc (with an initial dot) are
      now named x rather than X (matching colSums()): thus error
      messages are corrected.

    * A coef() method for class "maov" has been added to allow vcov()
      to work with multivariate results. (PR#16380)

    * method = "libcurl" connections signal errors rather than
      retrieving HTTP error pages (where the ISP reports the error).

    * xpdrows.data.frame() was not checking for unique row names; in
      particular, this affected assignment to non-existing rows via
      numerical indexing. (PR#16570)

    * tail.matrix() did not work for zero rows matrices, and could
      produce row "labels" such as "[1e+05,]".

    * Data frames with a column named "stringsAsFactors" now format and
      print correctly.  (PR#16580)

    * cor() is now guaranteed to return a value with absolute value
      less than or equal to 1. (PR#16638)

    * Array subsetting now keeps names(dim(.)).

    * Blocking socket connection selection recovers more gracefully on
      signal interrupts.

    * The data.frame method of rbind() construction row.names works
      better in borderline integer cases, but may change the names
      assigned.  (PR#16666)

    * (X11 only) getGraphicsEvent() miscoded buttons and missed mouse
      motion events.  (PR#16700)

    * methods(round) now also lists round.POSIXt.

    * tar() now works with the default files = NULL.  (PR#16716)

    * Jumps to outer contexts, for example in error recovery, now make
      intermediate jumps to contexts where on.exit() actions are
      established instead of trying to run all on.exit() actions before
      jumping to the final target. This unwinds the stack gradually,
      releases resources held on the stack, and significantly reduces
      the chance of a segfault when running out of C stack space. Error
      handlers established using withCallingHandlers() and
      options("error") specifications are ignored when handling a C
      stack overflow error as attempting one of these would trigger a
      cascade of C stack overflow errors.  (These changes resolve
      PR#16753.)

    * The spacing could be wrong when printing a complex array.
      (Report and patch by Lukas Stadler.)

    * pretty(d, n, min.n, *) for date-time objects d works again in
      border cases with large min.n, returns a labels attribute also
      for small-range dates and in such cases its returned length is
      closer to the desired n.  (PR#16761) Additionally, it finally
      does cover the range of d, as it always claimed.

    * tsp(x) <- NULL did not handle correctly objects inheriting from
      both "ts" and "mts".  (PR#16769)

    * install.packages() could give false errors when
      options("pkgType") was "binary".  (Reported by Jose Claudio
      Faria.)

    * A bug fix in R 3.0.2 fixed problems with locator() in X11, but
      introduced problems in Windows.  Now both should be fixed.
      (PR#15700)

    * download.file() with method = "wininet" incorrectly warned of
      download file length difference when reported length was unknown.
      (PR#16805)

    * diag(NULL, 1) crashed because of missed type checking.
      (PR#16853)

Something is wrong here. The formula

pmin(psi/VaR,exp(((abs(B)/Bmax)^w2)*log((psi/VaR),2.718182)))


provides a time series. Nevertheless, the returned values are incorrect and it produces NANs.

For starters, use 'pmin' (parallel min) instead of 'min'.

Dear R users,

I am trying to generate a 3D plot using the wireframe() function in the lattice package.

The corresponding formula in Excel looks as follows and is applied to the wireframe() function:

MIN(psi/K14,EXP(((ABS(H14)/peak)^omega)*LN(psi/K14)))

I tried to "translate" this formula in R and the code looks as follows


min(psi/VaR,exp(((abs(B)/Bmax)^w2)*log((psi/VaR),2.718182)))



In this case I get only one value which is NAN but I should get a time series with 13000 values. Hence, I deleted the min() function and tried the wireframe() function:


wireframe(inflator~exp((abs(B)/Bmax)^w2)*log((psi/VaR),base=2.718182),data=data_3Dplot)

However, it doesn't work as the formula for the inflator is incorrect. It produces NANs although it shouldn't do that and actually doesn't do that in Excel. Furthermore, the results are totally different to those calculated by Excel.

Can anyone help me with the formula and translate it correctly in terms of R? How do I get the time series? How do I get the values I get in Excel?

I have attached the data as csv file to this email.

Thank you very much for your help.

What about?

grep("^age$", x)

Oh, and regarding the moderator approval, I guess it's because you're a

Isn't that just an inefficient way to do

"age" == x

Subject: [R] Reading multiple tables from one .txt doc
Message-ID: <afdd8c079a604eb0bf18a3f67ef29d48@despmsx02.brainlab.net>

Dear all,
I have a .txt file which contains multiple tables and I would like to read these tables separately in order to create graphs for each one.
The tables are separated by a blank line, have a variable number of lines, fixed nr. Of rows, have a header and a comment above the header (#) which contains a specific word that identifies each table. (see example below). It would be possible to change the layout of the .txt data a bit (Add a word, remove comment etc..)
I would be extremely grateful if anyone could help me with this daunting task :-)

The only thing we can conclude at the moment is that you have not provided sufficient information. The standard mailing list "sig" is there in an effort to prevent just this situation.

One approach would be to use ?readLines to read the lines into a
character vector. You could then use indexing to remove all the blank
and header (lines beginning with "image") lines. You can now find the
indices of where the separate data blocks begin (they all begin with
"#", right?) and then sequentially read them into a list of data
frames, using ?strsplit to delineate columns and ?as.numeric to
convert the numeric columns. I leave it to you to work out what I
think are the straightforward details.

Do note, however, that there may be better ways to do this, especially
using some of the text manipulation packages and functions.  Have a
look at the "stringr" package or any others that searching might bring
up (rseek.org is a good search site for R; as is google of course).
And wait a bit for better suggestions before proceeding, as my brute
force approach should probably be considered a last resort.


Cheers,
Bert

See if you can use is.nan() to figure out which values of B, Bmax, ...,
cause
the result to be NaN (not a number).  One possibility is if B were always
negative so abs(B)/max(B) could be negative: (negative)^(non-integer power)
is NaN.

The following base R code does roughly what Bert suggests.  It does
no checking that the data is in the format you describe.  The
split-by-cumsum
trick is a handy idiom.

# lines <- readLines(yourFile), or, for this example:
lines <- c("#One","X Y Z","1 2 3","4 5 6","",
                "#Two", "X Y Z", "11 12 13", "",
                "#Three", "X Y Z", "21 22 23")
tables <- split(lines, cumsum( grepl("^#", lines)))
names(tables) <- vapply(tables, function(table)sub("^#", "", table[1]), "")
lapply(tables, function(text)read.table(text=text, header=TRUE, skip=1))
#$One
#  X Y Z
#1 1 2 3
#2 4 5 6
#
#$Two
#   X  Y  Z
#1 11 12 13
#
#$Three
#   X  Y  Z
#1 21 22 23

Subject: [R] Is my simulation to compute power of a multiple ordinal
 logistic regression right?

Good day,
I was performing a power analysis of articles published in a journal of management using the pwr package in R. However, it seemed to be impossible to compute power for small, medium and large Effect Size for multiple ordinal logistic regression output. I have tried using G*power, but it seemed to be just useful when we have simple logistic regression output. Thus, I have tried to simulate to calculate the power based on Greg Snow and Gung answers.    library(rms)

    tmpfun <- function(n, beta1,beta2,beta3,beta4,beta5,beta6,beta7,
    beta8,beta9,beta10,beta11,beta12,beta13,beta14) {   
    var1=log(runif(n,3,33))
    var2=rbinom(n,1,0.4502)
    x=1
    while (x>0.96) {var3=rbinom(n,1,0.9474); x=mean(var3)}
    var4=rbinom(n,1,0.2749)
    var5=rbinom(n,1,0.6199)
    var6=rbinom(n,1,0.4327)
    var7=rnorm(n,1.11,0.29)
    var8=rnorm(n,0.06,0.07)
    var9=runif(n,106,536804)
    var10=runif(n,0.08,3.7)
    var11=runif(n,0.08,0.92)
    var12=rnorm(n,96.24,113.11)
    for (i in 1:n) {if (var12[i]<=0) {var12[i]=runif(1)} else   
    {var12[i]=log(var12[i])}}
    var13=runif(n,0.05,0.88)
    var14=runif(n,-1.06,0.03)
    eta1 <- beta1*var1+beta2*var2+beta3*var3+beta4*var4+beta5*var5+
    beta6*var6
    eta2=eta1+beta7*var7+beta8*var8+beta9*var9+beta10*var10
    +beta11*var11+beta12*var12+beta13*var13+beta14*var14
    p1 <- exp(eta1)/(1+exp(eta1))
    p1=replace(p1,is.na(p1),1)
    p2 <- exp(eta2)/(1+exp(eta2))
    p2=replace(p2,is.na(p2),1)
    tmp <- runif(n)
    y <- (tmp < p1)+(tmp<p2)
    fit <- lrm(y~var1+var2+var3+var4+var5+var6)
    fit$stats[5]
    }
    out <- replicate(10000, tmpfun(n=112,0.582,-0.176,-0.413,
    -0.138,0.861,-0.942,3.481,4.542,1.059,0.322,-2.562,0.599,2.4,0.732))
    mean( out < 0.05 )
Is my simulation right? How can I get power for small, medium and large ES? Those are the questions... Thank for your time and your help.
Regards,
Adrien.

There are some packages that add labels or other attributes (units) to
columns of data frames and have methods to display the labels, units,
etc.  One of these packages is Hmisc, see the label and unit
functions.  I believe that there are other packages as well.  This may
provide what the original poster desires.

One way is to create a function of two arguments, e.g.

f <- function(x, y) x^2 + y^2

This function needs to be "vectorized", i.e. if x and y are vectors, it 
needs to pair the values and produce a vector as an answer.  Then

library(rgl)
persp3d(f)

will do a perspective plot of it.  There are a lot of optional arguments 
to set the range of x, y, labels, colours, etc.

Your question is a mixture of statistical and implementation (package) issues. This isn't really the right forum for "what is the statistically-correct answer" questions, and as to whether the package is correct or you are using it right would require someone familiar with that particular CONTRIBUTED package to be reading this list. (While this is probably one of the more widely used contributed packages,  there are over 8000 contributed packages so far and I for one don't use it...)

You could ask on stats.stackexchange.com where theory is more on topic, or you could try to get the maintainer to chime in (use the maintainer() function to find out who to cc), or you could just be patient.

Subject: [R] R column assignment fails for lists
Message-ID: <CADrG32Teg5oo+ZzjSdBSrFS6BVnH1vMgUkZDKVz25QSZD7a0Zw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R developers and users,

Consider the object :

> a <- data.frame(a=c(1,2), b=c(2,3), c=c("a,b","c,d"), stringsAsFactors = F)
> a$c <- strsplit(a$c, ",")

Re-assignment works fine for columns 1 and 2, but fails for column 3. If a
is a valid object, the assignment should work.

> a[,1] <- a[,1]
> a[,2] <- a[,2]
> a[,3] <- a[,3]
Warning message:
In `[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, , 3, value = list(c("a", "b"), c("c",  :
  provided 2 variables to replace 1 variables

Thanks for remembering me to cc him!

Thomas Lumley is the package maintainer, and he frequently answers
questions in this list, but it is obviously hard for anyone to keep up
with so many emails.

You are the one who should "consider the object". Look at what strsplit(a$c, ",") returns and then perhaps re-consider trying to assign it to a single column.

Hi Yasil,
If you look at what happens to a[,3] after the "strsplit" it is easy:

> a[,3]
[1] "a,b" "c,d"

Here a[,3] is two strings

a$c <- strsplit(a$c, ",")
> a[,3]
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b"

[[2]]
[1] "c" "d"

Now a[,3] is a two element list. What R probably did was to take the
first component of a[,3] to replace the existing two values. Now if
you don't try to fool R:

> a[,3]<-list(a[,3])
> a$c
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b"

[[2]]
[1] "c" "d"

Subject: [R] Custom data structures inside of a hash function
Message-ID: <CAJ=2b073WxEk5Th6AYGWaPnLHMVroBt8T4+eBrcYKYOJndC9Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have the following code:
http://pastebin.ca/3590201

What I'm trying to do is to create a hash map where the key is two
characters and
that maps to a structure of some information.  The problem with the above
example
is that the first two keys match to the first instance of c('hello', 0),
but the second is
completely ignored.  Ideally, I'd like to retrieve the structure with my
values based on
the key at hand and modify it as I see fit.

How can I achieve this?

Hi Steven,
If this is just a one-off, you could do this:

grepl("age",x) & nchar(x)<4

returning a logical vector containing TRUE for "age" but not "age2"

Hi Steven,

grep uses regex... so you can use this:

-grep("age$",x): it says: match "a", then "g", then "e" and stop.  The "$"
menas until here and no more.

> grep("age$",x)
[1] 5

Try working with a 3 row dataframe. Then your misconceptions about how this proposed assignment will be more prominent because the dimensions would be wrong.

Here's an alternate approach:

> a <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3), b=c(2,3,4), c=c("a,b","c,d", "e,f"), stringsAsFactors = F)
> strsplit(a$c, ",")
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b"

[[2]]
[1] "c" "d"

[[3]]
[1] "e" "f"

> do.call(rbind, strsplit(a$c, ",") )
     [,1] [,2]
[1,] "a"  "b" 
[2,] "c"  "d" 
[3,] "e"  "f" 


> str(cbind(a[-3] , do.call(rbind, strsplit(a$c, ",") ) ,stringsAsFactors=FALSE) )

This is actually a bit subtle -- you need to carefully read the Help
pages to see what's happening. Here's the explanation to the best of
my understanding (corrections happily accepted if I've got it wrong!).

First, let's simplify:

> z <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = list(a = letters[1:2], b = letters[3:4]))

> z
  a b.a b.b
1 1   a   c
2 2   b   d

> ncol(z)
[1] 3


So we ended up with a 3 column data.frame where it seems we should
only have two, with the second being a list with 2 components.

But that's not how it works. ?data.frame says:

"... data.frame converts each of its arguments to a data frame by
calling as.data.frame(optional = TRUE) "

and ?as.data.frame says:

"If a list is supplied, each element is converted to a column in the
data frame."

Hence when as.data.frame() is called on the second column, a 2 element
list, it converts it into a 2 column data frame (of 2 rows each) thus
giving 3 columns in all in the data frame, yielding the error you saw.

Something like this is what also happens in your assignment, I assume.
Jim's solution assigned a 1 element list which yielded what you wanted
when as.data.frame converted it into a single column.

I think....

Cheers,
Bert

Hi All,
Hi Carl,

I am not sure if this is useful to you, but I followed your conversation 
and thought of you when I read this:

for (i in 1:ncol(dataset)) {
  if(class(dataset) == "character|numeric|factor|or whatsoever") {
    dataset[, i] <- as.factor(dataset[, i])
  }
}
Source: Zumel, Nina / Mount, John: Practical Data Science with R, Manning 
Publications: Shelter Island, 2014, Chapter 2: Loading data into R, p. 25

This way you can select variables of a certain class only and do 
transformations. I found that this approach is not applicable if used with 
statistical functions like head(). Transformations worked fine for me.

I found reading the above given source worthwile.

Kind regards

Georg

Thank you Bill Dunlap.  So simple I never tried that approach. Tried 
dozens of others though, read manuals till I was getting headaches, and of 
course the answer was simple when one is competent.   Learning, its a 
struggle, but slowly getting there.
Thanks again

grepl("abc",abcplus) & nchar(abcplus)<8

do the job?

This is not a solution if you really want separate graphs of the
individual tables, but you could add column "Coord", roll everything
into a single table and then create one or more facet plots from that.

Ouch -- so many problems in such a short piece of R code !!!

Sorry, but after reading the above, I'd strongly recommend getting
better books about R...
       {{maybe do not take those containing "data science" ;-)}}

Compared to the nice and efficient solution of Bill Dunlap,
the above is really bad-bad-bad  in at least four ways :

0) They way you write it above, you cannot use it,
     <string> == "variant1|variant2|..."
   is pseudocode and does not really work

1) Note the missing "[, i]"  in the 2nd line: It should be
     if(class(dataset[, i]) ...

2) A for loop changing each column at a time is really slow for
   largish data sets

3) [last but not at all least!]
   Please ... many of you readers, do learn:
  
 Using checks such as
       if ( class(x) == "numeric" )
 are (almost) always wrong by design !!!

 Instead you really should (almost) always use

 	 if(inherits(x, "numeric"))

Why?  Because classes in R (S3 or S4) can *extend* other classes.
Example: Many of you know that after   fm <- glm(...)
class(fm) is   c("glm", "lm")   and so

    > if(class(fm) == "lm")
    + "yes"
    Warning message:
    In if (class(fm) == "lm") "yes" :
      the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

Similarly, in your case

y <- 1:10
class(y) <- c("myNumber", "numeric")

when that 'y' is a column in your data frame,
the test for  if(class(dataset[,i]) == "numeric")  will *not*
work but actually produce the above warning.

However, one  could als have had

Num <- setClass("Num", contains="numeric")
N <- Num(1:10)

     > Num <- setClass("Num", contains="numeric")
     > N <- Num(1:10)
     > N
     An object of class "Num"
      [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
     > if(class(N) == "numeric") "yes" else "no"
     [1] "no"
     > 

I hope that many of the readers --- including *MANY* authors of
R packages !! --- have understood the above and will fix their R
code -- and even more their books where applicable !!

It is impolite to put such a minor code fragment on a transient website. Also, this is a plain text mailing list... html usually gets stripped, damaging any advantage the HTML might have had and creating confusion for people reading your message, so please learn how to send plain text.

You wrote:

------
keys <- c('AB', 'AC')
values <- c(c('hello', 0), c('world', 0))
names(values) <- keys
cat(length(values))
-----

You seem to think this is Perl. The c function concatenates... it does not make tuples, it makes vectors, which must have all elements of the same type (unless the vector is of list type). And while vectors can have named elements, those names are not hashes. And since this is R, not Perl, you should use data structures that can be operated on in vectorized fashion, or you will have horrible performance.

So,  the unhelpful but literal answer to your question is

-----
values <- list( list( 'hello', 0 ), list( 'world', 0 ))
names( values ) <- c( "AB", "AC" )
values[[ "AC" ]]
values[[ "AC" ]][[ 2 ]] <- 1
-----

but if you want a scalable solution then you need something like

-----
values <- data.frame( string=c( "hello", "world" ), num=c( 0, 0 ) )
rownames( values ) <- c( "AB", "AC" )
values[ "AC", ]
values[ "AC", 2 ] <- 1
----

though often as not the names get stuffed into another column in the data frame and rows are simply accessed using integer or logical vector indexing.

Note that data frames are column oriented.  This is fundamental to the way R works... embrace it. 

If you absolutely must have a hash then you need environments, but they are tricky animals and are remarkably (if you come from a Perl background) rarely needed. 

A long time ago I came to R with similar thoughts of writing Perl in R... but eventually I read the actual words in the Introduction to R document instead of trying to reframe them in the Perl mind set and only then did I start to make progress with R.

Yes, but the answer is likely to depend on the actual patterns of strings in your real data, so the sooner you go find a book or tutorial on regular expressions the better.  This is decidedly not R specific and there are already lots of resources out there.

Given the example you provide,  the pattern "age$" should work. However, that is probably not sufficiently selective for a practical data set so start learning to fish (design regex patterns) yourself.

Hi Martin,

many thanks for your answer and your broad explanation. 

I am a newbie to "R" and got help on this list and thought I could give 
something back what looked OK to me.

regarding 0)
You're right, it's pseudo code. I assumed that anybody on the list would 
be able to adapt the code to their needs so that it worked. Next time I 
will post runnable code.

regarding 1)
Your right: "[, i]" is missing. My fault. Sorry.

regarding 3)
I got your point and will do better in the future.

One question: What books do you recommend to read to get to know "R" 
better?

Kind regards

Georg

Ouch -- so many problems in such a short piece of R code !!!

Sorry, but after reading the above, I'd strongly recommend getting
better books about R...
       {{maybe do not take those containing "data science" ;-)}}

Compared to the nice and efficient solution of Bill Dunlap,
the above is really bad-bad-bad  in at least four ways :

0) They way you write it above, you cannot use it,
     <string> == "variant1|variant2|..."
   is pseudocode and does not really work

1) Note the missing "[, i]"  in the 2nd line: It should be
     if(class(dataset[, i]) ...

2) A for loop changing each column at a time is really slow for
   largish data sets

3) [last but not at all least!]
   Please ... many of you readers, do learn:
 
 Using checks such as
       if ( class(x) == "numeric" )
 are (almost) always wrong by design !!!

 Instead you really should (almost) always use

                  if(inherits(x, "numeric"))

Why?  Because classes in R (S3 or S4) can *extend* other classes.
Example: Many of you know that after   fm <- glm(...)
class(fm) is   c("glm", "lm")   and so

    > if(class(fm) == "lm")
    + "yes"
    Warning message:
    In if (class(fm) == "lm") "yes" :
      the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

Similarly, in your case

y <- 1:10
class(y) <- c("myNumber", "numeric")

when that 'y' is a column in your data frame,
the test for  if(class(dataset[,i]) == "numeric")  will *not*
work but actually produce the above warning.

However, one  could als have had

Num <- setClass("Num", contains="numeric")
N <- Num(1:10)

     > Num <- setClass("Num", contains="numeric")
     > N <- Num(1:10)
     > N
     An object of class "Num"
      [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
     > if(class(N) == "numeric") "yes" else "no"
     [1] "no"
     > 

I hope that many of the readers --- including *MANY* authors of
R packages !! --- have understood the above and will fix their R
code -- and even more their books where applicable !!

Freely available from CRAN

These I can recommend as I went through them

?A Guide for the Unwilling S User? by Patrick Burns
?Using R for Data Analysis and Graphics - Introduction, Examples and Commentary?  by John Maindonald (PDF, data sets and scripts are available at JM's homepage).
?Practical Regression and Anova using R? by Julian Faraway (PDF, data sets and scripts are available at the book homepage).

There are also some German books but I do not have experience with them.

Dear all
In the grep command below, is there a way to identify only "age" and not "age2"? In other words, I like to greb "age" and "age2"
separately, one at a time. Thanks.

x<-c("abc","def","rst","xyz","age","age2")
x

[1] "abc"  "def"  "rst"  "xyz"  "age"  "age2"

grep("age2",x)

[1] 6

grep("age",x) # I need to grab "age" only, not "age2"

[1] 5 6

Dear Jim and David,

Thank you very much for your reply. I guess my question is whether it is
legal to store vectors in the elements of a data.frame. These are useful
for storing things like neighbors of a graph vertex, orthologs of a gene
etc. I have been using data frames of this sort and they are very useful,
so I am hoping this is a feature, rather than a bug. The weird code in my
email to form a was just one quick way of making such an object for a toy
example. These sort of data frames were doing fine for a number of analysis
pipelines until I used a function on them that had code of the sort
df[, j] <- sapply(df[, j], fun)

The interesting thing is that while
a[,3] <- a[,3] changes the object and gives the warning
a$c <- a$c works "correctly". leaving a to what it was and doesn't give a
warning.

If elements of a data frame are supposed to be able to store vectors, then
shouldn't
a[,3] <- a[,3] work?

Best regards,
yasir

Subject: [R] expression input to a function
Message-ID: <BN3PR07MB2577DCDD05AA808F324B55DEFA7B0@BN3PR07MB2577.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

I am trying to write a function, which can be made very general if one of the inputs can be an expression. ?How can this be done?


For example, to find root of a function, I would like to say

my.func <- function(x) {x^3 + 2 * (x^2) - 7}

x.left <- 0
x.right <- 2
n.iterations <- 0

find.root <- function(my.func, x.left, x.right) {
 # code here
return(c(x.mid, n.iterations))
}

The above method clearly does not work.  

Thanks,
Naresh

You are taking the right approach.  You can pass functions as arguments 
to other functions; they are "first class objects".  For example:

evaluate <- function(f, x) f(x)

evaluate(my.func, 3)

would give the same result as my.func(3).

For your find.root function, just write the search in find.root using 
the name of the argument (which for didactic purposes I'd recommend be 
different from the actual function name, but it'll be fine in practice).

It is also possible to pass expressions that aren't in functions, but it 
gets tricky, and you shouldn't do that in your first attempt.

?First - very important - please change from HTML posting to plain text.
This forum doesn't handle HTML well and its use very often results in
?unreadable and thus unusable messages.

?TLI (Too Little Information). I would probably help if you would post the
information from things like:

dput(head(msub))

dput(head(cn)?)


Most want "dput(msub)" and "dput(cn)", but I use the "head()" to subset
that to examples which are usually easier to post. It depends on the
problem and the size of the data involved. Oh, please don't just
cut'n'paste the output from simply listing "msub" or "cn", that produces
output which cannot be cut and pasted easily into an R session. Thanks.

Dear R-helpers,

I would like to know if it is possible using R (earth packages or another one) to realize robust MARS regression RMARS or RCMARS (C mean "conic").

Some authors have done it using MOSEK combined with Salford-MARS and special MATLAB programs.

Best Regards,

First, type
   names(msub)
and then type
   cn
and compare the output.

Probably, you will find a name in cn that is not among the names of msub.

To maybe make it easier to see the missing column(s), you can type

  setdiff(cn, names(msub))

The expression
  msub[,cn]
is intended to select columns from msub. That error message means that you
are trying to select one or more columns that are not there.

Or perhaps Bert Gunter is correct, and it should be
  msub[,'cn']
but I believe that if that were the case the error message would likely be
different. Without more information we can't be sure.

Message-ID: <VI1PR03MB145502589EEB2F0193B83472D77B0@VI1PR03MB1455.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,
I am an R beginner and new to the list. In preparation for using mi to impute missing values I am setting up the missing data frame and would like to specify the transformation types for some of my variables, as I will be using these transformations in my analysis models. According to the documentation the available options are "standardize" (the default), "identity", "log", "logshift" and "sqrt". I can successfully change the transformation types to "log" and "logshift", but when I attempt to change to "sqrt", this changes the type to "log" instead. I'd appreciate your help, please.
Below are details of my system and some code which replicates the issue.

It does not seem to be a ploblem with lower dimension though

I'm I missing something about the computation?

@ Steven;

As is almost always the case I agree with Jeff. I found that reading Rhelp and attempting to answer regex-questions was the best method to learn them. In particular I found the postings by Gabor Grothendieck very helpful in getting some degree of competence in this area. I see that his grep-related postings still exceed my grep postings and I assure you that his will be more sophisticated than my efforts. I recommend the MarkMail Rhelp mirror interface as very useful in "mining" Rhelp for knowledge:

Gabor Grothendieck answers with either 'grep' pr 'regex' in their body:

Hi Martin and list:
First let me thank you for thinking of me.?? It is probably apparent that my programming experience is limited, and the vector aspect of R has taken some getting used to.?? A very very long time ago I did some programming in Fortran and for loops and if statements were ordinary, useful, and used frequently.?? Now if I see a for loop and if statement together then it is flatly apparent that I need to rework that code to take advantage of R's strengths using vectoized functions on whatever object I am working on.??
It has also become apparent that one should read manuals, experiment with some code to firmly cement the knowledge, and build a solid foundation.?? My natural inclination is the opposite.? I am anxious to produce some code to solve a problem or satisfy curiosity or ....? R is not something one can learn and use productively in a few weeks or months.?? It is powerful, subtle, and takes some thinking.?? I started this trek into R with Jared Lander's book "R for Everyone",? progressed to Prof Norman Matloff's "The Art of R Programming" (which was way beyond my comprehension at the beginning) and Hadley Wickham's "ggplot2" book, and several courses with Data Camp and Couresra.? One day I will be at the point where I do know what I don't know about R and at that time I will almost be competent with the language.

I have taken the work from Bill Dunlap and Giorgio Garziano and have applied it to my little project and am just amazed that so little code can do so much.? I have also followed Bert Gunter's advice and taken that code and dissected it item by item to comprehend what each element is doing.?? 

The knowledge and help on this list is just amazing and I do appreciate the efforts of all involved.? I read the digest daily .

Ouch -- so many problems in such a short piece of R code !!!

Sorry, but after reading the above, I'd strongly recommend getting
better books about R...
? ? ? {{maybe do not take those containing "data science" ;-)}}

Compared to the nice and efficient solution of Bill Dunlap,
the above is really bad-bad-bad? in at least four ways :

0) They way you write it above, you cannot use it,
? ? <string> == "variant1|variant2|..."
? is pseudocode and does not really work

1) Note the missing "[, i]"? in the 2nd line: It should be
? ? if(class(dataset[, i]) ...

2) A for loop changing each column at a time is really slow for
? largish data sets

3) [last but not at all least!]
? Please ... many of you readers, do learn:
? 
 Using checks such as
? ? ? if ( class(x) == "numeric" )
 are (almost) always wrong by design !!!

 Instead you really should (almost) always use

 ??? if(inherits(x, "numeric"))

Why?? Because classes in R (S3 or S4) can *extend* other classes.
Example: Many of you know that after? fm <- glm(...)
class(fm) is? c("glm", "lm")? and so

? ? > if(class(fm) == "lm")
? ? + "yes"
? ? Warning message:
? ? In if (class(fm) == "lm") "yes" :
? ? ? the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

Similarly, in your case

y <- 1:10
class(y) <- c("myNumber", "numeric")

when that 'y' is a column in your data frame,
the test for? if(class(dataset[,i]) == "numeric")? will *not*
work but actually produce the above warning.

However, one? could als have had

Num <- setClass("Num", contains="numeric")
N <- Num(1:10)

? ? > Num <- setClass("Num", contains="numeric")
? ? > N <- Num(1:10)
? ? > N
? ? An object of class "Num"
? ? ? [1]? 1? 2? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8? 9 10
? ? > if(class(N) == "numeric") "yes" else "no"
? ? [1] "no"
? ? > 

I hope that many of the readers --- including *MANY* authors of
R packages !! --- have understood the above and will fix their R
code -- and even more their books where applicable !!

No matter how expert you are at writing regular expressions,
it is important to list which sorts of strings you want matched
and which you do not want matched.  Saying you want to match
"age" but not "age2" leads to lots of possibilities.  Saying how
you want to categorize each string in a vector of stirngs like
the following would narrow things down.
   c("age", "ages ago", "age 60", "An aged man", "page", "Age", "age1",
      "age2",  "dark age", "the aGE")
>From such a list, make a good verbal description of the rule you
are thinking of and someone will be able to translate that into a regular
expression (or say that regular expressions cannot do the job).

My efforts found a 'latex2exp' but no 'latex2expr'. Are you sure you are not missplelling the package name?

I just installed from source from that repository into an R 3.2.5 library. (I first needed to reinstall that version since I had moved to 3.3.0. Admittedly I was doing this on a Mac but since the package does not require any C/Fortran level compiling, my experience should mimic that of a Linux user using a source package.

How can I resolve the dependencies?
Should I replace the Ubuntu version with something fresh?

Thanks in advance,

Please do not re-post. Search on your own. Entering "community
detection" at the rseek.org R search site brought up many hits,
especially from the igraph package.

I only know how to compute these three cofindence intervals in multicomparsion by using multcomp package, and i am search a lot for how to comupte the three CIs for linear regression coefficients but without any useful information, so, plz help me ~

Your question does not detail where the 'confint' function in pkg:multcop is letting you down. After the first few lines of the first example I type:

confint(wht)

#---------------
And get:

	 Simultaneous Confidence Intervals

Multiple Comparisons of Means: Tukey Contrasts


Fit: aov(formula = breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks)

Quantile = 2.4155
95% family-wise confidence level
 

Linear Hypotheses:
           Estimate lwr      upr     
M - L == 0 -10.0000 -19.3536  -0.6464
H - L == 0 -14.7222 -24.0758  -5.3687
H - M == 0  -4.7222 -14.0758   4.6313


Subsequent examples on that page use linear regression models as there starting point.

Thank you for providing a working example. I think you need to contact the package maintainer:

When I run your code it appears that the c column is correctly transformed to square roots, but the show() function is incorrectly indicating a log transform:

> data.missingdf at variables$c at raw_data # The raw data
[1]  4.2  7.9   NA 16.1 19.9 23.0
> sqrt(data.missingdf at variables$c at raw_data) # The square root of the raw data

Subject: [R] Changing transformations in mi package

Dear all,
I am an R beginner and new to the list. In preparation for using mi to impute missing values I am setting up the missing data frame and would like to specify the transformation types for some of my variables, as I will be using these transformations in my analysis models. According to the documentation the available options are "standardize" (the default), "identity", "log", "logshift" and "sqrt". I can successfully change the transformation types to "log" and "logshift", but when I attempt to change to "sqrt", this changes the type to "log" instead. I'd appreciate your help, please.
Below are details of my system and some code which replicates the issue.

Hi Andreas,
Try installing plyr, arm, scales and mi separately. If you get an
error message about a version mismatch, that's where your problem is.
_Sometimes_ upgrading R will fix it, if the problem is that the
version you are downloading is too new for your R version.

Did you follow the instructions for setting up apt to pull recent versions of R, as described in CRAN? I suspect not, since your version is old.

Hello Jim,

Indeed, this might be the problem. When I try to install plyr, I get
something like this:
"Package xxx is not availlable (not for this version 3.0.x)"

I was hoping that any old version from the Ubuntu repositories would be
good enough for an absolute beginner.

Thank you very much,
Andreas

Dear Andreas,

As has been suggested, you're probably better off using an up-to-date version of R and corresponding up-to-date packages, but if the only issue is that sem can't be installed, the Rcmdr package should still work. The menu item for confirmatory factor analysis will be missing, and unless you tell it to suppress checking for missing packages on start-up, the Rcmdr will continue to ask you whether you want to install the sem package, but everything else should work.

To suppress the start-up package check, issue the R command options(Rcmdr=list(check.packages=FALSE)) before library(Rcmdr).

I hope this helps,
 John

Hello Jeff,

Thank you very much for taking notice.

I was hoping that any old version which used to be the best of breed 3
years ago would be just fine for absolute beginners.
I did not even know that CRAN exists until I actually installed the
software. I use Ubuntu because compiling software is a major annoyance
to me. Since 2002 I use to compile something every now and then when it
is the only way to get something installed.

Right now I try to follow the R installation guide carefully but dumb
because I don't really understand what I'm doing. configure, make, make
check, everything runs OK so far but sudo make install fails anyway.
What a horrible waste of time and electricity!

Actually, I'm trying to help my daughter who needs to learn some R
basics. The installation on a Windows PC is a matter of minutes by
following a tiny instructional PDF from her tutor. But she does not have
the time nor knowledge to install R successfully on her Ubuntu PC which
is the same as mine. While she has some real work to do, I'm trying to
get this darn thing onto our computers. Even if I manage to compile a
working R program on my computer, this will not be of any help for my
daughter who does not have the compilers installed and I don't know
which packages make it happen on my PC. I'd have to build my first
Debian package which might take another day of reading and testing.

[...]

Meanwhile the installation of R out of debian packages from a CRAN
server did the job and I managed to ...

>  install.packages("Rcmdr",dependencies=TRUE)

... which finished with ...

> ** testing if installed package can be loaded
> * DONE (Rcmdr)

... but also with warnings ...

May be we can live without GL support for now.

An old version of R would be fine if that was all you wanted, but no, you want all the latest contributed packages as well. I can't blame you for that, but don't blame R for difficulties with contributed packages that have external dependencies and depend on recent versions of R.

You might find

http://trestletech.com/2012/10/install-rgl-in-ubuntu/

helpful with your RGL package issue. 

I very rarely configure/compile since apt is so powerful. IMHO you should always start with apt on Debian derivatives before falling back to compiling.

Subject: [R] request for collaborator for animation of optimization
	computations
Message-ID: <572B51B9.3000206@gmail.com>

In an email exchange with Hans Werner Borchers, two optimization
problems were mentioned where the optimization parameters define
positions that can be graphed. One is a chain hanging problem (catenary)
and the other the largest area polygon where the vertices cannot be more
than one unit apart. Three decades ago I used the latter with very
positive reactions to demonstrate optimization to semi-technical
audiences, and I have found that the program will still run. However, it
would be very useful to have a modern R implementation, possibly as a
Web app, that can be used to illustrate optimization problems in a way
that is accessible to non-technical audiences, as well as demonstrating
R capabilities. If possible, I'd like to find a collaborator with skills
in coding the graphics, which "update" steadily as the area in the
polygon increases, as my expertise is weak in graphics. Please contact
me off-list if interested.

For those who are not familiar with the polygon problem, the best known
case is that the largest constrained (or small) hexagon is NOT a regular
hexagon, but almost a pentagon with one edge slightly dented.

For those wanting to see the idea, the MSDOS executable, which still
runs (clunkily) in my Windows XP virtual machine or under DOSBOX for
Linux is at

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8l8dalpp9v03qf8/VMPOLY2A.EXE?dl=0

There is also an approximation to the BASIC source code (I seem to have
lost the exact version) at

https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0zldgufkn2jie4/VMPOLY2Y.BAS?dl=0

This can be run under GWBASIC in DOSBOX or under the PC-BASIC emulator from

https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcbasic/

Subject: [R] boostrap - not converging cycles
Message-ID: <EB6D324B-F529-4148-811C-FDEC7407BFC4@gmail.com>

Dear all, 

I have a problem, rather serious and I am not being able to resolve it.

I started working with R a few time ago :( 

I?m running a bootstrap analyses for 2 different methods and It was expected that I get the same coefficients and standard errors for both, consequently the same coverage - but I?m not getting the same values.

With the estimates obtained in bootstrap we don?t get that, which means that there are resampling cycles that are different, even more, as the coverage is different, it leads me to think that there are bootstrap cycles that do not converge and therefore left out of coverage.

A. Is there a way of knowing which were the cycles that did not converge and correct the estimates?
B. For this I have the "results? saved - 

save.image("~/Documents/phd_april_v16.RData?) will this be useful for something?

Best,
RO



Atenciosamente,
Rosa Oliveira

Dear all,
I am an R beginner and new to the list. In preparation for using mi to impute missing values I am setting up the missing data frame and would like to specify the transformation types for some of my variables, as I will be using these transformations in my analysis models. According to the documentation the available options are "standardize" (the default), "identity", "log", "logshift" and "sqrt". I can successfully change the transformation types to "log" and "logshift", but when I attempt to change to "sqrt", this changes the type to "log" instead. I'd appreciate your help, please.

Super,

Are you just interested in having the final intervals computed for
you?  Or are you trying to compute them yourself so that you can learn
more about what they do?  Or something else?

If the first is the case then you can just use the multicomp package
as you have mentioned.  David was assuming that this was your approach
and wanted to know why that was not good enough, what you did with
multicomp and why you were not satisfied with the results.  If you are
happy using multicomp and just are not seeing a piece that you are
expecting, then show us what you have tried,  what the results are,
what you expect the results to be, and how the last 2 differ.  Then we
can better help you.

If your goal is to learn, then re-inventing the wheel can be a good
thing, but make it clear that learning is the important part, not just
getting an answer.  Also show us what you have done so far, what
references you are using for the formulas, and where you are stuck.

If your goal is something else, then give us more details.

Hi there,in case one has found a nice and easy reproducible example of a Morans'I example where neighborhoods are depicted and their calculated correlations are visible as well.Point is to make some examples that I can share with students that want to understand fast what is the notion about.

OK, I think that I understand better.  In your original post it
appeared that you already had used the multcomp package.  But now it
looks like you have heard that multcomp is the tool to use, but you
don't know how to use it, is that correct?

p.s.  It is best to keep these discussions on the list, others may be
quicker to respond and/or have better answers.

I only heard these CIs in Multcomp package, but i totally don't understand how to compute these CIs for coefficients of linear regression. So i asked u for help, i hope u can understand me. Any help can be useful whether you show me related  package, code or  how to compute the CIs.  Note that, my question is how to compute these CIs for coefficients not the difference in means for different groups.

Subject: [R] How to access to an created array with a cicle for
Message-ID: <003601d1a6e8$04d338b0$0e79aa10$@thenavigatorcompany.com>

Hi,

I'm organizing one data base in array's (matrix of positions and for each
position I have a vector with 5 variables). And I have approximately 600
array's.

To construct these array's I've used a for cicle and after construct the
array I named it like: E_1_1_1.1, and I've done the same for the others
array's, like: E_2_1_4, .

 

After, I need to access these constructed array's to compare them. But when
I try to call them, in a for cicle, like noquote(paste(E,x,y,z,sep="_")) or
simply E_x_y_z (varying x, y and z) R assume the name of the array as a
"string" but don't associate the name to the array object created.  How can
I call the array created before with a for cicle varying the index's
"x","y","z" ?

 

Ty,

 

Catarina Silva

You can use get(), but a more R-like way is to make a list of these
matrices instead of 600 separate objects.

thismat <- get(paste(E,x,y,z,sep="_"))

I want a function to evaluate one argument
in the environment of a data.frame supplied
as another argument.  "attach" works for
this, but "with" does not.  Is there a way
to make "with" work?  I'd rather not attach
the data.frame.


With the following two functions "eval.w.attach"
works but "eval.w.with" fails:


dat <- data.frame(a=1:2)
eval.w.attach <- function(x, dat){
   attach(dat)
   X <- x
   detach()
   X
}

eval.w.with <- function(x, dat){
   with(dat, x)
}

eval.w.attach(a/2, dat) # returns c(.5, 1)

eval.w.with(a/2, dat) # Error ... 'a' not found


Thanks, Spencer Graves

How about using eval( substitute( ...))?

 eval.w.sub <- function(expr, datt){
   eval( substitute(expr), env=datt)
                         }
 eval.w.sub(a/2, dat)
#[1] 0.5 1.0

Thanks for pointing that out.  Unfortunately, it didn't work inside 
another function.  However, if I had looked at it, I might have been 
able to thought to try it.  Spencer

Message-ID: <OFFAAF6EAC.0DEF1A65-ONC1257FAB.0023970D-C1257FAB.0024A2FF@unisg.ch>

Dear R userers,

I am running truncated regressions with the 'truncreg' package. My sample 
is large (6,000 observations), the data is left-truncated at 1 and the 
left tail of the data is heavily centered at 1. When I am running the 
regression I receive the following error message: 

  Error in optim(par = start[!fixed], fn = logLikFunc, control = control, 
: 
  initial value in 'vmmin' is not finite

>From a previous discussion (
http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/betareg-help-td3350129.html) on a similar 
issue in the betareg function I assume that the error message stems from 
that the estimate of the starting value of the precision parameter is 
negative. However, I do not know how I can take care of this. Thus I would 
be very thankful for any help.

Best regards,
Philipp

Actually, I think a better overall strategy is to say that if you want to pass an expression to a function, then pass an expression object (or a call object or maybe a formula object). 

Once you figure out _how_ your eval.w.attach works (sort of), you'll get the creeps: 

Lazy evaluation causes the argument x to be evaluated after the attach(), hence the evaluation environment of an actual argument is being temporarily modified from inside a function. 

Apart from upsetting computer science purists, there could be hidden problems: One major issue is that  values in "dat" could be masked by values in the global environment, another issue is that an error in evaluating the expression will leave dat attached. So at a minimum, you need to recode using on.exit() magic.

So my preferences go along these lines:

> dat <- data.frame(a=1:2)
> eval.expression <- function(e, dat) eval(e, dat)
> eval.expression(quote(a/2), dat)
[1] 0.5 1.0
> eval.expression(expression(a/2), dat)
[1] 0.5 1.0

> eval.formula <- function(f, dat) eval(f[[2]], dat)
> eval.formula(~a/2, dat)
[1] 0.5 1.0

Your post in HTML format came through garbled.  Please post plain text email on this list. 

Your question is unclear as well.  Perhaps you are not familiar with using the str() function preview what is in an object?

I don't know what data set you are using, so for reproducibility I'm
using the data set from the example in the function documentation.

=====
library(survey)
data(api)
dclus1 <- svydesign(ids = ~ dnum, fpc = ~ fpc, data = apiclus1)
grr <- svyciprop(~ I(ell == 0), dclus1, method = "likelihood")
attr(grr, "ci")
#         2.5%        97.5%

Hi, Peter:


       I don't like eval.expression or eval.formula, because they don't 
automatically accept what I naively thought should work and require more 
knowledge of the user.  What about David's eval.w.sub:


a <- pi
dat <- data.frame(a=1:2)
eval.w.sub <- function(a, Dat){
   eval( substitute(a), env=Dat)
}
 > eval.w.sub(a/2, dat)
[1] 0.5 1.0


       This produces what's desired in a way that seems simpler to me.


       By the way, I really appreciate Peter's insightful comments:


eval.w.attachOops <- function(x, Dat){
   attach(Dat)
   X <- x
   detach()
   X
}
 > eval.w.attachOops(a/2, dat)
The following object is masked _by_ .GlobalEnv:

     a

[1] 1.570796
 > eval.w.attachOops(b/2, dat)
The following object is masked _by_ .GlobalEnv:

     a

Error in eval.w.attachOops(b/2, dat) : object 'b' not found
 > search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "Dat"               "package:graphics"
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"
 > objects(2)
[1] "a"

*** NOTES:


       1.  This gives a likely wrong answer with a warning if "a" exists 
in .GlobalEnv, and leaves "Dat" (NOT "dat") attached upon exit.



       2.  A stray "detach()" [not shown here] detached 
"package:stats".  oops.


*** Using "on.exit" fixes the problem with failure to detach but not the 
likely wrong answer:


detach()
search()
eval.w.attachStillWrong <- function(x, dat){
   attach(dat)
   on.exit(detach(dat))
   X <- x
   X
}
The following object is masked _by_ .GlobalEnv:

     a

[1] 1.570796
 > eval.w.attachStillWrong(b/2, dat)
The following object is masked _by_ .GlobalEnv:

     a

Subject: [R] RandomForest-question about split point and GetTree function
Message-ID: <CAOBKCDcVGjkci8kH-SKf=h2H=w0yLr4s41Vr89BMhVmpk6peiQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking at results of a random forest. In the documentation, it says
the following for categorical variables:

"For categorical predictors, the splitting point is represented by an
integer, whose binary expansion gives the identities of the categories that
goes to left or right. For example, if a predictor has four categories, and
the split point is 13. The binary expansion of 13 is (1, 0, 1, 1) (because
13 = 1 ? 2 0 + 0 ? 2 1 + 1 ? 2 2 + 1 ? 2 3 ), so cases with categories 1,
3, or 4 in this predictor get sent to the left, and the rest to the right. "

I am unsure how to interpret this when the splitting point is 0. I was
thinking it means all categories would be to the right. Is this correct?

I liked eval.expression and tested it with a bquote(...) argument to see if that would succeed. It did, but it didn't return what you wanted for `a/2`, so I tried seeing if a "double eval wuold deliver both yours and my desired results:

 eval.w.sub <- function(a, Dat){
  eval( eval(substitute(a),Dat), env=Dat)
 }
x=2
 eval.w.sub( a/2, dat)
[1] 0.5 1.0
 eval.w.sub( bquote(2*a*.(x) ), dat)
[1] 4 8

We are here retracing the path the Hadley took in some of his ggplot2 design decsions. Unfortunately for me those NSE rules often left me confused about what should and shouldn't be 'quoted' in the as-character sense and what should be quote()-ed or "unquoted" in the bquote() sense.

This is a plain-text email list, so your red doesn't show up, but
since the error message said that the installer couldn't find the sp
package, I'd start by installing that.

I am puzzled why the original install.packages call did not also download the sp package, since the default argument dependencies = NA should have triggered installation of imports including spDep, which should in turn have installed the dependencies including the sp package. Anyone have a theory?

Any hypothesis would require more information, sessionInfo() at a very minimum.

Hi there,

Is there any way to find out high correlated variables among a big matrix?
for example I have a matrix called data= 2000*5000 and I need to find the
high correlated variables between the variables in the columns! (Need 100
high correlated variables from 5000 variables in column)

I could calculate the correlation matrix and pick the high correlated ones
but my problem is, I just can pick pairs of variables with high correlation
and may be we have low correlation across the pairs! Means, in my 100*100
correlation matrix, there are some pairs with low correlation and I
couldn't find the 100 variables which they all have high correlation
together!!!
Would you please ley me know if there is any way?

Thanks

Are you rying to find clusters of variables according to some distance

The rcorr function in Hmisc will return a list whose first element is a correlation matrix

> base <- rnorm(100)

> test <- matrix(base+0.2*rnorm(300), 100)

> rcorr(test)[[1]]
          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
[1,] 1.0000000 0.9631220 0.9721688
[2,] 0.9631220 1.0000000 0.9666564
[3,] 0.9721688 0.9666564 1.0000000

You can use which to to find the locations meeting a criterion (or two):

> mycorr <- .Last.value

> which(mycorr > 0.97 & mycorr != 1, arr.ind=TRUE)
     row col
[1,]   3   1
[2,]   1   3

I think you need to set dependencies=TRUE to make the checks recursive.

Thanks Sarah, downloaded the sp package separately and that resolved the error.

Message-ID: <CADDFq30xBMGdJ1hvm_a=iohrG6KWdM6ddU3fd98-ue7cEDDWUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to ge get the next month of the year.

today <- Sys.Date()
xx<- format(today, format="%B%Y")

I got  "May2016",  but I want  Jun2016. How do I do that?

My other question is that, I read a data  and do some analysis  and I
want to send all the results of the analysis to a pdf file

Example
x5 <- runif(15, 5.0, 7.5)
x5


I tried this one

 pdf(file=" test.pdf")
 x5
dev.off()

I found the file is empty. I would appreciate if you help me out.

Thanks in advance

Hi 

I have two dataframes(df1, df2) with equal number of columns (1566) but lesser rows in df2 (2772 in df1 and 40 in df2). Row names are 
identical in both dataframes (date). I want to replace NAs of df1 with the values of df2 for all those rows having identical row names (date) but 
without affecting already existing values in those rows of df1. 

Please see below: 

df1: 
date     11A  11A   21B   3CC   3CC 
20040101  100   150   NA   NA   140 
20040115   200   NA   200   NA   NA 
20040131   NA   165   180   190   190 
20040205   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA 
20040228   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA 
20040301  150   155   170   150   160 
20040315   NA   NA   180   190   200 
20040331   NA   NA   NA   175   180 

df2: 
date     11A  11A   21B   3CC   3CC 
20040131   170   NA   NA   NA   NA 
20040228   140   145   165   150   155 
20040331   NA   145   160   NA   NA 

I want the resulting dataframe to be: 

df3: 
date         11A  11A   21B   3CC   3CC 
20040101      100   150   NA   NA   140 
20040115      200   NA   200   NA   NA 
20040131      170   165   180   190   190 
20040205      NA   NA   NA   NA   NA 
20040228      140   145   165   150   155 
20040301      150   155   170   150   160 
20040315      NA   NA   180   190   200 
20040331      NA   145   160   175   180 

If it is possible, I would prefer to use "for loop" and "which" function to achieve the result. 

Please guide me in this regard. 

Thanks 
Saba

today <- Sys.Date()
nextmo<- paste0( month.abb[ as.numeric(format(today, format="%m"))+1] ,
                 format(today,"%Y") )
[1] "Jun2016"

pdf() opens a graphics device, so you need a function that establishes a coordinate system:

x5 <- runif(15, 5.0, 7.5)
pdf(file=" test.pdf"); 
plot(1,1,type="n")
text(1, 1, paste(round(x5, 2), collapse="\n") )
dev.off()

I doubt that this is what you really want, and suspect you really need to be studying the capabilities supported by the knitr package. If I'm wrong about that and you want a system that supports drawing and text on a blank page, then first study:

> library(grid)
> help(pac=grid)

If you choose that route then the text "R Graphics" by Paul Murrell will be indispensable.

Why would you want to use a for loop?  Is this homework?

Thanks, John.

The trouble with that solution is that it gives the index for where the
cursor was before clicking rather than the cell that was clicked. The
solution is that the <Button-1> binding gives the x, y pixel coordinates of
the click to the callback, and those just need to be translated to cell
index via tkindex ( My (almost) solution gives the pixel coordinates of the
mouse click. There is a function that converts the coords to cell index,
but I was having trouble figuring out the format of parameters, but the
following works:

tcl(table1, "index", as.tclObj(paste0("@",x, ",", y)))

I.e., to retrieve the index of the cell that is clicked on:

# create table
tt<-tktoplevel()
tclRequire("Tktable")
table1<-tkwidget(tt,"table",rows=3,cols=3)
tkgrid(table1)

tkbind(table1, "<Button-1>", function(x, y){
  cellIndex<-tcl(table1, "index", as.tclObj(paste0("@",x, ",", y)))
  print(tclvalue(cellIndex))
})

Thanks again!

-Dan

It occurred to me that at the end of the year you would want to increment the year as well. This calculates the next month and increments the year value if needed:

 today <- as.Date("2008-12-01")
 nextmo<- paste0(m <- month.abb[(as.numeric(format(today, format="%m"))+1) %/% 12] , 
                  as.numeric( format(today,"%Y") ) + (m == "Jan") )
 nextmo
#[1] "Jan2009"

If you need to suppress the axes and their labels:

 pdf(file=" test.pdf"); plot(1,1, type="n", axes=FALSE, xlab="", ylab="")
 text(1, 1, paste(round(x5, 2), collapse="\n") )
 dev.off()

To add to what David said, maybe you want ?sink or ?capture.output  .

If you're really looking to combine your own text and R output, than
knitr is probably what you want. The RStudio ide integrates this
stuff, so you may want to look at that, too.

Cheers,

Thank you very much David.

So there is no general formal that works year all round.

The first one work only Jan to Nov
today <- Sys.Date()
nextmo<- paste0( month.abb[ as.numeric(format(today, format="%m"))+1] ,
                 format(today,"%Y") )
[1] "Jun2016"

The second one works only  for the last month of the year.
today <- as.Date("2008-12-01")
 nextmo<- paste0(m <- month.abb[(as.numeric(format(today,
format="%m"))+1) %/% 12] ,
                  as.numeric( format(today,"%Y") ) + (m == "Jan") )
 nextmo


Many thanks

You could install and load the 'lubridate' package, which has month()
and month<-() functions so you can do the following:

> z <- as.Date(c("2015-01-29", "2016-01-29", "2016-05-07", "2016-12-25"))
> z
[1] "2015-01-29" "2016-01-29" "2016-05-07" "2016-12-25"
> month(z) <- month(z) + 1
> z
[1] NA           "2016-02-29" "2016-06-07" "2017-01-25"

Subject: [R] Issue replacing dataset values from read data
Message-ID: <E8628E91E7FC33438D6681B3341266E2016A170E@ex09.net.ucsf.edu>

Dear all,

I am reading a modest dataset (2297 x 644) with specific values I want to change. The code is inelegant but looks like this:

df <- read.csv("mydata.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# yrsquit, packyrs missing for following IDs. Manually change.
for(myid in c(2165, 2534, 2553, 2611, 2983, 3233)){
     temp <- subset(df, id == myid)
     df[df$id == myid , "yrsquit"] <- 0
     temp.yrssmoke <- temp$age-(temp$agesmoke+temp$yrsquit)
     df[df$id == myid , "yrssmoke"]  <- temp.yrssmoke
     df[df$id == myid , "packyrs"] <- (temp$cigsdaytotal/20)*(temp.yrssmoke)
}

If I run just the first line and then the for loop, it works.
If I run the first line and for loop together, yrsquit is properly replaced to == 0, but packyrs is NA still.

Obviously there's many ways around this specific problem, but I was wondering what the issue is here, so as to look out for and avoid it in the future.

Apologies for the lack of reproducible code; I haven't yet reproduced the problem with generated data.

Much thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Emily

Sorry;

This works as intended:

Hi Emily,
I haven't tested this exhaustively, but it seems to work:

df<-data.frame(id=2001:3300,yrssmoke=sample(1:40,1300,TRUE),
 cigsdaytotal=sample(1:60,1300,TRUE),yrsquit=sample(1:20,1300,TRUE))
dfNA<-sapply(df$id,"%in%",c(2165,2534,2553,2611,2983,3233))
# create your NA values
df[dfNA,c("yrsquit","packyrs")]<-NA
# since you know the NA id values
df[dfNA,"yrsquit"]<-0
df[dfNA,"packyrs"]<-df[dfNA,"yrssmoke"]*df[dfNA,"cigsdaytotal"]/20

1. It's not immediately clear why you need the line "temp <- subset(df, id
== myid)"

2. The objects described by "temp$age", temp$agesmoke, and temp$yrsquit are
all vectors. So temp.yrssmoke is also a vector. This means that when you
replace, it should be with "<- temp.yrssmoke[i]", where "i" is the (row)
 number you're looping over (note "temp" re-numbers rows to 1 through 6,
another reason to remove the "temp" line).

3. Ditto for " <- (temp$cigsdaytotal[i]/20)*(temp.yrssmoke[i]) "

Hope this helps!

Hi R'ers,

I noted that R breaks lines for any output greater than 80 chars,
Is there a way to expand this limit ?

Actually, I think this may depend on context. options(width =...)
directly controls only what is described in it's Help file. It does
not necessarily control the width of lines in the console or whatever
GUI you might be interacting with, nor necessarily the width at which
many objects are printed, which is under the control of their print()
methods, including defaults. Note, however, many such defaults default
to the options value, which may or may not be what you want for them.

Cheers,

As in the thread you quote above, it is hard to say what is going on 
without a reproducible example. It is possible that the problem is caused 
by some problem of (almost) degenerate data (as was the case with the 
betareg example). With a reproducible example we might be able to say 
more.

As an alternative to truncreg() you might try the function trch() from 
package "crch": trch(y ~ x1 + x2 + ... | 1, data = mydata, left = 0). This 
is a different implementation of the same model so possibly this avoids 
the problem - but maybe not.

Following the message of Bert Gunter, you should explain better what you 
have done (not everyone know that describeBy is a function of psych 
package) and what you want. You said "error bars"... but what "error 
bar"? (I don't like the term "error bars". Most often they are not 
errors but dispersion bar; if you read French, you can check this ppt 
from a conference I gave : Myths and legends in statistics : 
http://max2.ese.u-psud.fr/epc/conservation/Publi/Mythes.pdf

Here is a reproducible example, and it works:
 > library("psych")
 > df <- data.frame(A=rnorm(10, 10, 2), B=rnorm(10, 9, 3), 
C=sample(c("G", "H"), 10, replace=TRUE))
 > d <- describeBy(df[, c("A", "B")], group=df$C)
 > error.crosses(d$G, d$H)

Message-ID: <DB5PR07MB1109B1DC0DB19077FDD39ED6DB7F0@DB5PR07MB1109.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi All,


Whilst using 'trainControl' and 'train' functions in R studio, an error is raised stating that the functions are not found.


I tried installing the caret function a few times, but the error persists.


Can anyone guide me how to access these functions.


Many Thanks and


Kind Regards

Reproducible example?  At least whatever you did... and the output of sessionInfo().

Did you use library function to load it into memory?

Firstly, many thanks for kind consideration.

***I wrote the following R code:
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("e1071")

library(caret)
library(e1071)

set.seed(100)

tr.control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
Error: could not find function "trainControl"

cp.grid <- expand.grid(.cp = (0:10)*0.001)

tr_m <- train(project_delay ~ project_lon + project_lat + project_duration + sector + contract_type + capital_value, data = trainPFI, method="rpart", trControl=tr.control, tuneGrid = cp.grid)
Error: could not find function "train"

I hope this will explain the situation I am facing right now.

Hello,

Works with me, but I'm using R v 3.3.0. Note that your version of R is  
over 1 year old, try updating it.

install.packages("caret")
install.packages("e1071")

library(caret)
library(e1071)

set.seed(100)

tr.control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)

class(tr.control)
[1] "list"

Hope this helps,

I am attaching a excel in which I have given Year on Year profits as well
as % growth over last year..

Thanks you very much.


The issue resolved by just upgrading the R and R studio to their latest versions. All the packages are now successfully installed. Henceforth, the code runs absolutely okay.

Reproducible example? At least whatever you did... and the output of sessionInfo().

Did you use library function to load it into memory?

Hi All,


Whilst using 'trainControl' and 'train' functions in R studio, an error is raised stating that the functions are not found.


I tried installing the caret function a few times, but the error persists.


Can anyone guide me how to access these functions.


Many Thanks and


Kind Regards

Hi Prasad,
You are probably looking for linear modelling of some sort. The first
thing to do is to read the data into R (if you haven't already done
so). You will almost invariably have a _data frame_ in which the
columns will contain values for at least year and profit.

Then plot the profits of A B and C against years. You can do that
using a function like "matplot" (graphics).

Finally, add linear regression lines by getting the result of the "lm"
(stats) function and add them to your plot using "lines" (graphics).
Look at it. Are the letters close to the corresponding lines for each
company or are they scattered all over the plot? If you are lucky,
they will be the former. If not, you will probably have learned enough
about R to inquire what you can do next.

Jim

Hi, Hadley et al.:


       Hadley's link requires his development version of "lazyeval", 
which can be obtained as follows:


library(devtools)
install_github("hadley/lazyeval")


       Hadley's link describes real problems with elegant solutions.


       However, David's solution solved my immediate problem, and it's 
not immediately obvious to me how his "expr_text" function (or other 
functions in "lazyevel") to produce a better solution.


       Thanks again to David, Peter and Hadley for their replies.


       Spencer Graves

The lazyeval package addresses the problem of how to delay evaluation even when the function you want to do the evaluation in is buried two or more function calls below where the original call was made. If you are not building nested function calls with delayed evaluation then you probably don't need that package.

Hi All,

I have the following script, that raises error at the last command. I am new to R and require some clarification on what is going wrong.

#Creating the training and testing data sets
splitFlag <- sample.split(pfi_v3, SplitRatio = 0.7)
trainPFI <- subset(pfi_v3, splitFlag==TRUE)
testPFI <- subset(pfi_v3, splitFlag==FALSE)

library(e1071)

set.seed(100)

tr.control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
cp.grid <- expand.grid(.cp = (0:10)*0.001)

#Fitting the model using regression tree
tr_m <- train(project_delay ~ project_lon + project_lat + project_duration + sector + contract_type + capital_value, data = trainPFI, method="rpart", trControl=tr.control, tuneGrid = cp.grid)

Summary of sample sizes: 443, 442, 441, 442, 441, 442, ...
Resampling results across tuning parameters:
  cp     RMSE      Rsquared

  0.001  439.6319  0.5451104

  0.009  441.5715  0.5401718
  0.010  441.1401  0.5407121
RMSE was used to select the optimal model using  the smallest value.
The final value used for the model was cp = 0.005.

#Fetching the best tree
best_tree <- tr_m$finalModel

Alright, all the aforementioned commands worked fine.

Except the subsequent command raises error, when the developed model is used to make predictions:
best_tree_pred <- predict(best_tree, newdata = testPFI)
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'sectorHospitals' not found

Can someone guide me what to do to resolve this issue.

Any help will be highly appreciated.

Many Thanks and

Kind Regards

Jeff:

That's easy to do already with substitute(), since you can pass around
an unevaluated expression (a parse tree) however you like. As I read
it, (admittedly quickly) what it's main feature is that it allows you
more control over the environment in which the expression is finally
evaluated -- as well as permitting nested expression evaluation fairly
easily.

But maybe we're saying the same thing ...  IMHO I think Hadley has
gone overboard here, worrying about rarely important issues, as you
seem to be intimating also.

Feel free to set me straight... or ignore.

Cheers,
Bert

It seems that the data that you used for prediction contained a level
"Hospitals" for the sector factor that did not appear in the training
data (or maybe it's the other way round). Check this.

Not really to "set anyone straight", but there are some subtleties with mode call objects versus expression objects and formulas to be aware of. 

E.g.,

> a <- 2
> do.call("print", list(a*pi))
[1] 6.283185
> do.call("print", list(quote(a*pi)))
[1] 6.283185
> do.call("print", list(expression(a*pi)))
expression(a * pi)
> do.call("print", list(~a*pi))
~a * pi

Thing is, if you insert a call object into a parse tree, nothing is there to preserve its nature as an unevaluated expression. Similarly, in

> call("print", quote(a*pi))
print(a * pi)

the result is identical to quote(print(a * pi)), so when evaluated, quoting is not seen by print().

As far as I understand, this is also the reason that for math in ggplot, you may need as.expression(bquote(....)).

In general, I think that a number of things in R had been more cleanly implemented using formulas/expression objects than using substitution and lazy evaluation, notably subset and offset arguments in lm/glm. It would have been so much cleaner to have

lm(math ~ age, data = foo, subset = ~ sex=="1")

than the current situation where lm internally chops its own head off and substitutes with model.frame, then evaluates the call to model.frame() which in turn does eval(substitute(subset), data, env). Of course, at the time, ~ was intended specifically for Wilkinson Rogers type formulas; "abusing" it for other kinds of expressions is something of an afterthought.

These are absolutely critical issues that crop up as soon as other
people want to write functions that use your functions that use NSE.

Of course, at the time, ~ was intended specifically for Wilkinson Rogers type formulas; "abusing" it for other kinds of expressions is something of an afterthought.

Yeah, to my mind, the cool thing about formulas is that they provide a
concise way to capture an environment and an expression, and then
Wilkinson Rogers are just a special case.

It's obvious impossible to go back and change how lm() etc works now,
but I'm reasonably confident that lazyeval provides a strong
foundation going forward. The quasiquotation stuff is particularly
important - and unquote-splice makes it possible to do things that are
impossible with bquote().  (Of course, unquote-splice could be added
to bquote(), but I think you'll still run into issues with
environments)

 keeping it in POSIXct format
Message-ID: <CANkFkEfj36sr2z2chemtcEm=mGW6AHWHgiA29zQ0bG95LJsDLw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear UseRs,

I know two ways to convert dates and time from on time zone to another but
I am pretty sure that there is a better (cleaner) way to do that.


Here are the methods I know:


## The longest way ...

T1 <- as.POSIXct("2016-05-09 10:00:00", format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
tz="America/New_York")

print(T1)

T2 <- as.POSIXct(format(T1, tz="UTC"), tz="UTC") # format convert it to
character, so I have to convert it back to POSIXct afterward.

print(T2)



## The shortest but probably not the cleanest ...

attributes(T1)$tzone <- "UTC"

print(T1)

I don't have an answer, but actually, I would have expected
as.POSIXct(T1, tz="UTC")
to work...

Looks like as.POSIXct cannot convert from class "POSIXct"

This involves mucking with the internals as well but it is short:

   structure(T1, tzone = "UTC")

I think as.POSIXct will just pass through a POSIXct object without any
changes.  E.g.,
  > dput(as.POSIXct( structure( list(quote(foo)),
class=c("POSIXct","POSIXt"))))
  structure(list(foo), class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt"))

If as.POSIXct( POSIXctObject, tz="ZONE") changed the time zone then a fair
bit of code would have to be changed from
    t <- as.POSIXct(t)
to
    if (!is.POSIXct(t)) {
        t <- as.POSIXct(t)
    }
so that existing POSIXct objects would not have their time zones changed.

Having a tzone<- or tz<- function could be handy.

Hi Bert,

Thanks for the response.

I checked the datasets, however, the Hospitals level appears in both of them. See the output below:

            sector count(*)
1          Defense        9

4           Others       99

It seems that the data that you used for prediction contained a level
"Hospitals" for the sector factor that did not appear in the training
data (or maybe it's the other way round). Check this.

It is extremely difficult to tell what the issue might be without a
reproducible example.

The only thing that I can suggest is to use the non-formula interface to
`train` so that you can avoid creating dummy variables.

Subject: [R] Clean method to convert date and time between time zones
 keeping it in POSIXct format
In-Reply-To: <CANkFkEfj36sr2z2chemtcEm=mGW6AHWHgiA29zQ0bG95LJsDLw@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CANkFkEfj36sr2z2chemtcEm=mGW6AHWHgiA29zQ0bG95LJsDLw@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <D3561022.172CBC%macqueen1@llnl.gov>

I think setting the attribute is the best way to "convert", and the
following will hopefully explain why. (And I would tend to agree with
William Dunlap that a function to set the attribute might help userRs.)



R always stores POSIXct objects internally in seconds since an origin in
UTC. I would not think in terms of converting; I would think in terms of
displaying.


t1 <- as.POSIXct("2016-05-09 10:00:00", tz="America/New_York")
t2 <- t1
attributes(t2)$tzone <- 'UTC'

> print(t1)
[1] "2016-05-09 10:00:00 EDT"
> print(t2)
[1] "2016-05-09 14:00:00 UTC"

> as.numeric(t1)
[1] 1462802400
> as.numeric(t2)
[1] 1462802400



The actual value of t2 is the same as t1, it has not been "converted"
(because to me conversion implies change, and there has been no change in
the value of t2). R has been merely been told to display it in UTC when
printed.


Similarly, when a character string is converted to POSIXct, R has to be
told what timezone to use to convert it to seconds since the origin in
UTC. If a timezone is not specified, the user's local (default) timezone
is used.

> t3 <- as.POSIXct("2016-05-09 10:00:00")
> t3
[1] "2016-05-09 10:00:00 PDT"
> as.numeric(t3)
[1] 1462813200


The number of seconds for t3 is different than for t1 and t2, and this is
because I am not in the America/New_York timezone

And, in fact,

> (as.numeric(t3) - as.numeric(t1))/3600
[1] 3


Indicating that PDT and America/New_York are three hours apart, as indeed
they are.

To me, this version
  t4 <- as.POSIXct(format(t1, tz="UTC"), tz="UTC")
doesn't recognize the distinction between internal storage and display,
and the fact that there is no real conversion.

> identical(t2, t4)
[1] TRUE




To go a little further,

> attributes(t3)
$class
[1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt"

$tzone
[1] ""


If a timezone is not specified when the object is created, then the tzone
attribute is set to "" and R displays using the local timezone.

> t3
[1] "2016-05-09 10:00:00 PDT"

I can change the local timezone:

> Sys.setenv(TZ='UTC')
> t3
[1] "2016-05-09 17:00:00 UTC"

t3 has not changed, but how it is displayed has changed.

Given all this, it's helpful that the format() function for POSIXt objects
has a tz argument.

> format(t3, tz='US/Pacific')
[1] "2016-05-09 10:00:00"


Indicating again that t3 has not changed; I've just manipulated to rules
for how it is displayed.

Please find the sample dataset attached along with R code pasted below to reproduce the issue.


#Loading the data frame

pfi <- read.csv("pfi_data.csv")

#Splitting the data into training and test sets
split <- sample.split(pfi, SplitRatio = 0.7)
trainPFI <- subset(pfi, split == TRUE)
testPFI <- subset(pfi, split == FALSE)

#Cross validating the decision trees
tr.control <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv", number=20)
cp.grid <- expand.grid(.cp = (0:10)*0.001)
tr_m <- train(project_delay ~ project_lon + project_lat + project_duration + sector + contract_type + capital_value, data = trainPFI, method="rpart", trControl=tr.control, tuneGrid = cp.grid)

#Displaying the train results
tr_m

#Fetching the best tree
best_tree <- tr_m$finalModel

#Plotting the best tree
prp(best_tree)

#Using the best tree to make predictions [This command raises the error]
best_tree_pred <- predict(best_tree, newdata = testPFI)

#Calculating the SSE
best_tree_pred.sse <- sum((best_tree_pred - testPFI$project_delay)^2)

#
tree_pred.sse

Many Thanks and

It is extremely difficult to tell what the issue might be without a reproducible example.

The only thing that I can suggest is to use the non-formula interface to `train` so that you can avoid creating dummy variables.

I checked the datasets, however, the Hospitals level appears in both of them. See the output below:

It seems that the data that you used for prediction contained a level
"Hospitals" for the sector factor that did not appear in the training
data (or maybe it's the other way round). Check this.

Why are you predicting from tr_m$finalModel instead of from tr_m?

Hi Bill,


Many thanks for highlighting the issue. It worked as I predicted using the tr_m. I'm extremely grateful for the insight.


Thanks for all who gave me prior guidance as well.

It is extremely difficult to tell what the issue might be without a reproducible example.

The only thing that I can suggest is to use the non-formula interface to `train` so that you can avoid creating dummy variables.

Hi Bert,

Thanks for the response.

I checked the datasets, however, the Hospitals level appears in both of them. See the output below:

            sector count(*)
1          Defense        9

3          Housing       32

It seems that the data that you used for prediction contained a level
"Hospitals" for the sector factor that did not appear in the training
data (or maybe it's the other way round). Check this.

Bert

Is there a way to get ggplot scale_colour_distiller to display all values in the legend? 

Currently using this code.

thanks!

I've brought this up numerous times... you shouldn't use `predict.rpart`
(or whatever modeling function) from the `finalModel` object. That object
has no idea what was done to the data prior to its invocation.

The issue here is that `train(formula)` converts the factors to dummy
variables. `rpart` does not require that and the `finalModel` object has no
idea that that happened. Using `predict.train` works just fine so why not
use it?

Hi Luca,
The function readHTMLtable is in the XML package, not httr. Perhaps
that is the problem as I don't see a dependency in httr for XML
(although xml2 is suggested).

Message-ID: <OF15A2364C.38B38E20-ONC1257FAF.00287156-C1257FAF.0028D3F1@lotus.hawesko.de>

Hi All,

I would like to route the output to a file using sink(). When using the 
example from the ?sink documentation:

sink("sink-examp.txt")
i <- 1:10
outer(i, i, "*")
sink()
unlink("sink-examp.txt")

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")
sink()
file.show("all.Rout")

I can not open the file in Windows Explorer. The error message is:

"Cannot open file. File is in use be another proces."

How can I close the file in a manner that I can open it right after it was 
created?

Kind regards

Georg

Hi Jim,

Thank you for your suggestion. I have actually tried to upload XML and xml2
but nothing changed...any other suggestion?

Kind regards,

I don't fully remember, but I doubt httr::content() ever returned a
character vector without using the `as="text"` parameter. Try
switching that line to:

    html <- content(r, as="text")

Subject: Re: [R] Problem while predicting in regression trees

I've brought this up numerous times... you shouldn't use `predict.rpart` (or whatever modeling function) from the `finalModel` object. That object has no idea what was done to the data prior to its invocation.

The issue here is that `train(formula)` converts the factors to dummy variables. `rpart` does not require that and the `finalModel` object has no idea that that happened. Using `predict.train` works just fine so why not use it?

It is extremely difficult to tell what the issue might be without a reproducible example.

The only thing that I can suggest is to use the non-formula interface to `train` so that you can avoid creating dummy variables.

Hi Bert,

Thanks for the response.

I checked the datasets, however, the Hospitals level appears in both of them. See the output below:

            sector count(*)
1          Defense        9

Any thing else to try?

It seems that the data that you used for prediction contained a level
"Hospitals" for the sector factor that did not appear in the training
data (or maybe it's the other way round). Check this.

Hi Georg,
I don't suppose that you have:

1) checked that the file "all.Rout" exists somewhere?

2) if so, looked at the file with Notepad, perhaps?

3) let us in on the secret by pasting the contents of "all.Rout" into
your message if it is not too big?

At a guess, trying:

 close(zz)

might get you there.

Hi Jim,

thanks for your reply.

ad 1)
"all.Rout" was created in the correct directory. It exists properly with 
correct file properties on Windows, e.g. creation date and time and file 
size information.

ad 2)
I can not access the file with Notepad.exe directly after it was created 
by R.  The error message is (translated):

"Cannot access file "all.Rout". The file is opened by another process."

ad 3)
If I close R completely the file access is released. Then I can read the 
file using Notepad.exe. The contents is:

Error in log("a") : non-numeric argument to mathematical function

I tried

close(zz)

but the error persists.

To me it looks like R is still accessing the file and not releasing the 
connection for other programs. close(zz) should have solved the problem 
but unfortantely it doesn't.

What else could I try?

Kind regards

Georg

Can anyone help me to solve the issue.

By using" boot" and "boot.ci" package in R we can construct bootstrap confidence intervals. How we calculate the coverage probability of these intervals.

Have you tried:

try(log("a"))
sink()

Subject: [R] Ensure parameter is a string when passed within an lapply &
 called function runs a 'substitute' on it
Message-ID: <57310388.e873c20a.284cd.062d@mx.google.com>

Hi, 

I?m trying to solve what looks like the same issue as stack overflow article, but within an lapply:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18939254/cant-use-a-variable-as-an-argument-but-can-use-its-value

I?ve replicated the issue with partialPlot below in ?testFunc?. The lines up to the final print can?t change (including the substitute). In the first call it prints out ?X1? correctly, in the second it prints out ?var?. I?ve tried eval, quote etc as the article suggests. Any ideas?

numObs ?<- 10
numVars <- 6
dataSet ? ?<- data.frame(replicate(numVars,rnorm(numObs)))
# partialPlot(x = model, pred.data = dataSet, x.var = 'X1', plot = F)?

testFunc <- function(x, pred.data, x.var, plot=F) {
? x.var <- substitute(x.var)
? # print(paste('is.character(x.var)', is.character(x.var), 'is.name(x.var)',?is.name(x.var)))
? xname <- if (is.character(x.var)) x.var else {
? ? if (is.name(x.var)) deparse(x.var) else {
? ? ? eval(x.var)
? ? }
? }
? print(xname)
? # print(head(pred.data[,xname]))
}

vars <- names(dataSet)[[1]]
testFunc(x = model, pred.data = dataSet, x.var = local(vars), plot = F)

lapply(vars, function(var) {
? # print(paste('var', var))
? testFunc(x = model, pred.data = dataSet, x.var = var, plot = F)
})

George,
I do not know what operating system you are working with, but when I use sink() under windows, I need to specify a valid path which I don't see in your code. I might, for example specify:

sink("c:\myfile.txt")
 R code goes here
sink()

with the expectation that I would create a file myfile.txt that would contain the output of my R program.

Try closing the type of sink you're actually opening:


zz <- file("all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
sink(type = "message")
close(zz)
unlink(zz)


If you look carefully at the example in?sink, there are two close
statements, one for each stream being sent to that file.

Subject: [R] intermediate action button necessary to update graph-not
	responding
Message-ID: <VI1PR06MB1102AE0CEAFE4ADB58AEBC49B9710@VI1PR06MB1102.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,
I'm aware that this is not a suitable question for this resource but neither Stackoverflow nor shiny help forum could help with the problem I'm having- is it possible that you could point me in the right direction?
thanks
Chris

I have a command from a particular package that outputs a graph. The command requires preliminary processed input via a different command that is defined in the same package. Hence my plan is to create an app whereby the user can interactively update the map. This as far as I can see will require 2 action buttons: "actionbutton A" will re-run the preliminary processing command with input from a "checkboxGroupInput". "actionbutton B" will then update the graph with the new input from the preliminary processing command.

#ui.R
checkboxGroupInput("column_choices", "column choice", colnames(data), selected=c("column1", "column2"....)),
actionButton(inputId="choices", label="Update tag"))

actionButton(inputId="replot", label="Update plot")),
plotOutput("graph")

#server.R
servercell <- function(input, output) {
  dataInput<-observeEvent(input$choices, {
    isolate(tagData(IRIS[, input$column_choices]))
  })
  output$SPV<-renderPlot({
    input$replot
    isolate(package_defined_plot_function(data=data, dataTag=dataInput()))
    })
}

The buttons work when tested independent of each other: the checkbox input seems to update fine, after clicking "Update tag"/actionbutton A and the graph seems to work fine after clicking "Update plot"/actionbutton B (when dataInput() is not an argument in the plot function).

My problem is that dataInput<-observeEvent(input$choices, {..... does not allow the graph to display. When dataInput() is made an argument of the plotting function- instead of the graph displaying on the app page- in place of that I get the error: could not find dataInput function

As I said buttons A and B work fine when independent of each other..... however their coexistence conflicts... and having two action buttons is the only way I can think of to update the graph interactively... if anyone can think of how to do it with one button that would be great.

When I do this with one output command, :
output$SPV<-renderPlot({
dataInput<-
package_defined_plot_function(data=data, dataTag=tagData(runif(input$cell_choices(isolate())))
})
I try some variation(cannot remember the actual syntax) of the above but it forces me to shut down my R session as the data handling seems to go on an infinite loop (I can not show you the exact error for this as in order to get it I have to crash the R session- it looks some thing like: "cannot compute -Inf"). hence I would be much more comfortable with tow buttons.
I am quite stuck as I don't know what to do... any tips?

Thank you David for your reply,

But still couldn't get my answer.
I've already used the rcorr and created the correlation matrix and found
the high correlated variables but just among the two variables, it means I
could find the pairs of variables with high correlation.
So I couldn't get for example 100 variables that all of them are high
correlated together.

Dear Clint, I think you are right! It's better to tell that I'm  trying to
find clusters of variables according to some distance metric! would you
please let me know how I can solve it?

Thanks

Hi Sarah, John, Jim,
Hi All,

I have set my envrionment variable 

path <- file.path("H:", "2016", "Analysis")
setwd(dir = path)

This works well cause the file is created in that directory.

I have tried

close(zz)
unlink(zz)

and neither worked nor did it work out using them together.

I had this before when working with IBM SPSS Statistics. There was a 
workaround for the problem in SPSS.

Is there one for R?

Kind regards

Georg

George,
I do not know what operating system you are working with, but when I use 
sink() under windows, I need to specify a valid path which I don't see in 
your code. I might, for example specify:

sink("c:\myfile.txt")
 R code goes here
sink()
with the expectation that I would create a file myfile.txt that would 
contain the output of my R program.

Please help us help you.  Tell us what you have tried and where you
have looked (otherwise we may just point you to things you already
know about).  Also what is your focus (simple analysis, learning,
programming, ...)?

The best place to start is with "An Introduction to R" which Installs
with R.  Then there are a lot of tutorials pointed to from the main R
website.


Comparing R and Rstudio is not an either/or question.  R is the
statistical package, Rstudio is an interface to R (Rstudio by itself
is not very useful, it passes the commands to R).

Think of R as being a car with only a few options, it can take you
anywhere and for many it is good enough.  Rstudio is a nice options
package (power steering, a GPS navigation system, etc.)  Things that
make driving the car easier and more enjoyable, but would not help
much without the car to add them to.

R and RStudio are two different types of thing; it's not a question of
"which one to use".  RStudio is a front-end (interface) for R. You
probably *should* use RStudio (rather than the standard "R console"
interface that comes with R), it's well supported and has lots of
useful features.  Most of the time when you're asking questions,
though, they will be questions about R (unless they are specific
issues about the *interface*, they won't be RStudio-specific).

  It's hard to tell you where to start with "informative material".
What is most useful will depend on your background; your field/desired
type of analyses; language; personality; etc. etc..  There are literally
thousands of R tutorials and books, many available for free on the
internet.  I'd suggest you google "learning R programming", inspect
a dozen or so of the top hits, and see which ones seem to suit you

Note that the backslash should be doubled (so it isn't interpreted as an 
escape for the "m" that follows it), or replaced with a forward slash.

  Calculating coverage probability for any but the simplest
cases requires simulations.  You need to simulate a particular
scenario; for each simulation, use your estimation and confidence-interval
calculation procedure; and then score the particular simulation
as 1 (estimated CI included the true parameter value) or 0
(true parameter value fell outside the estimated CI). Across
a large number of simulations, the proportion of ones is
an estimate of the coverage.

This is discussed more here:

Wrapping as.character around it also retrieves a version, although the first line was interpreted as a header and the the data was all character:

Message-ID: <2107261304.1608099.1462900492113.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

I have been trying to install the package "reshape2" using the code:
> install.packages("reshape2")
I get the following return:

Installing package into ?C:/Users/Jason/Documents/R/win-library/3.0?
(as ?lib? is unspecified)
Warning: unable to access index for repository http://cran.cs.wwu.edu/bin/windows/contrib/3.0
Warning message:
package ?reshape2? is not available (for R version 3.0.2)
When I went to the list of packages to look up reshape2, it said this package needs compilation. I did not see an indication of which R versions it is available for.
I went to the R for Windows FAQ, but it did not seem very helpful. The relevant sentences seemed to be:
"For packages with code that needscompilation you will need to collect and install several tools: you candownload them via the portal athttp://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/. Once you have doneso, just run R CMD INSTALL pkgname at a Windows commandprompt."
I did the download, but I do not understand the meaning of the last sentence, since R does not recognize R CMD INSTALL as a valid code line, and the usual install.packages("reshape2") still returns the same error. What did I miss?

Well, here's a very bad way of doing this:

vars <- names(dataSet)

lapply(vars, function(var) {
  assign("y",var,pos=parent.frame(2))
  testFunc(x = model, pred.data = dataSet,
x.var=eval(y,parent.frame(2)), plot = F)
} )

## results in

[1] "X1"
[1] "X2"
[1] "X3"
[1] "X4"
[1] "X5"
[1] "X6"
[[1]]
[1] "X1"

[[2]]
[1] "X2"

[[3]]
[1] "X3"

[[4]]
[1] "X4"

[[5]]
[1] "X5"

[[6]]
[1] "X6"


Assigning to the calling environment is a bad idea, but I have not
figured out a better way to go about this.

Subject: [R] web scraping tables generated in multiple server pages
Message-ID: <ff65b860-65aa-35b0-546b-646380e7ec37@yorku.ca>

This is my first attempt to try R web scraping tools, for a project my 
daughter is working on.  It concerns a data base of projects in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, listed at 
http://outorgaonerosa.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/relatorios/RelSituacaoGeralProcessos.aspx, 
but spread out over 69 pages accessed through a javascript menu at the 
bottom of the page.

Each web page contains 3 HTML tables, of which only the last contains 
the relevant data.  In this, only a subset of columns are of interest.  
I tried using the XML package as illustrated on several tutorial pages, 
as shown below.  I have no idea how to automate this to extract these 
tables from multiple web pages.  Is there some other package better 
suited to this task?  Can someone help me solve this and other issues?

# Goal: read the data tables contained on 69 pages generated by the link 
below, where
# each page is generated by a javascript link in the menu of the bottom 
of the page.
#
# Each "page" contains 3 html tables, with names "Table 1", "Table 2", 
and the only one
# of interest with the data, "grdRelSitGeralProcessos"
#
# From each such table, extract the following columns:
#- Processo
#- Endere?o
#- Distrito
#- Area terreno (m2)
#- Valor contrapartida ($)
#- Area excedente (m2)

# NB: All of the numeric fields use "." as comma-separator and "," as 
the decimal separator,
#   but because of this are read in as character

# its the third table on this page we want

Andrew:

Actually, thinking about it a bit more, I think my "solution" is not
really a solution either; that is, it will fail in use. My
understanding, which may be wrong and which others may correct, is
this: in the lapply call, x.var = ... will result in substitute(...)
in testFunc yielding an unevaluated call with my eval() "solution".
The problem is: when this call gets evaluated in testFunc() **where**
does it get evaluated? The answer is: in the testFunc environment
(lexical scoping); if not found there in the parent of testFunc, which
is the environment in which testFunc **was defined**, not called, and
so on up through the tree of frames. My solution works only because I
stuck "var" in the global environment, which happened to be where
testFunc was defined. This will not be true in general, and almost
certainly will fail for your actual use case.

I see no clean solution for this issue -- it's the nature of lexical
scoping. A simple way to make it work is just to stick var in the
.GlobalEnv or baseenv(), depending on where the function with
substitute comes from (but probably the latter). Then var will be
found by lexical scoping. e.g., for your example:

vars <- names(dataSet)

lapply(vars, function(var) {
  # print(paste('var', var))
  assign("somename",var,globalenv())
  testFunc(x = model, pred.data = dataSet, x.var =
eval(somename,globalenv()), plot = F)
})

I would hope someone else may offer a better approach.


Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] error in lmerTest after updating to R 3.3.0
Message-ID: <57322A7F.1000609@ieu.uzh.ch>

Dear all,

After updating to R 3.3.0 (inadvertently, via apt-get), I get an error 
when using lmerTest. Here is an example:

library(lmerTest)
library(MASS)
data(oats)
m <- lmer(Y ~ N*V + (1|B/V), data=oats)
summary(m)

summary from lme4 is returned
some computational error has occurred in lmerTest

I have removed all old libraries and tried to have as clean an 
installation as possible, but this did not fix the problem.

Is this an incompatibility or a problem with my installation?

Thanks for your help

Pascal

# what is missing to you
?gsub
# aliasing
df <- sp.tab[, wanted]

# convert to double
as.double(                                      # convert to double
    gsub(',', '.',                              # makes the ',' to become '.'
    gsub('\\.', '', df$"?rea Excedente (m2)"))  # get rid of the dot

You can easily put the names of the columns and use lapply on them to
convert all of them in same manner, that is left as an exercise.

Unfortunately, it's a wretched, vile, SharePoint-based site. That
means it doesn't use traditional encoding methods to do the pagination
and one of the only ways to do this effectively is going to be to use
RSelenium:

    library(RSelenium)
    library(rvest)
    library(dplyr)
    library(pbapply)

    URL <- "http://outorgaonerosa.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/relatorios/RelSituacaoGeralProcessos.aspx"

    checkForServer()
    startServer()
    remDr <- remoteDriver$new()
    remDr$open()

    remDr$navigate(URL)

    pblapply(1:69, function(i) {

      if (i %in% seq(1, 69, 10)) {

        # the first item on the page is not a link but we can just grab the page

        pg <- read_html(remDr$getPageSource()[[1]])
        ret <- html_table(html_nodes(pg, "table")[[3]], header=TRUE)

      } else {

        # we can get the rest of them by the link text directly

        ref <- remDr$findElements("xpath",
sprintf(".//a[contains(@href, 'javascript:__doPostBack') and .='%s']",
i))
        ref[[1]]$clickElement()
        pg <- read_html(remDr$getPageSource()[[1]])
        ret <- html_table(html_nodes(pg, "table")[[3]], header=TRUE)

      }

      # we have to move to the next actual page of data after every 10 links

      if ((i %% 10) == 0) {
        ref <- remDr$findElements("xpath", ".//a[.='...']")
        ref[[length(ref)]]$clickElement()
      }

      ret

    }) -> tabs

    final_dat <- bind_rows(tabs)
    final_dat <- final_dat[, c(1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14)] # the cols you want
    final_dat <- final_dat[complete.cases(final_dat),] # take care of NAs

    remDr$quit()


Prbly good ref code to have around, but you can grab the data & code

Subject: [R] Quantiles on multiply imputed survey data - mitools
Message-ID: <F29237C5-CDD2-4215-B516-B37D066D0678@toxstrategies.com>

Hello, and thank you for considering this question:

The svystat object created with multiply imputed NHANES data files is failing on calling survey::svyquantile. I'm wondering if I'm diagnosing the issue correctly, whether the behavior is expected, and whether y'all might have any ideas for workarounds.

I'm following T. Lumley's general method outlined here: http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/old-survey/svymi.html, but with data files I've imputed myself on the 2001/2002 biennial. Each file has 1081 observations and no missing values.

### Create the survey design object with list of imputed data files ImputedList0102.
des <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=imputationList(ImputedList0102), nest=TRUE)


### Blood analyte of interest
var_name <- "LBXTCD" # analyte in blood serum

### All is well calculating the mean:
M <- with(des, svymean(make.formula(get('var_name'))))
summary(M)
Result <- MIcombine(M)
Result$coefficients
# LBXTCD 
# 17.41635


### but svystat object fails to calculate a 50th percentile:
### it fails when hard-coding the name rather than using make.formula;
### it fails regardless of number of files or choices in handling ties or interval type.
### There are 16 ties in each data file.
M1 <- with(des, svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), quantiles = c(.5)))
summary(M1)

#     Length Class  Mode   
#[1,] 1      -none- numeric
#[2,] 1      -none- numeric
#[3,] 1      -none- numeric


### The quantile is successfully calculated on one file at a time, however, and is different for each file.
### (had thought perhaps there was a lack-of-variance issue). The quantile calculated on each file
### is the same regardless of interval.type.
des_single1 <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=ImputedList0102[[1]], nest=TRUE)
svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), des_single1, c(.5))
# 0.5
# LBXTCD 13.5554


des_single2 <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=ImputedList0102[[2]], nest=TRUE)
svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), des_single2, c(.5))
# 0.5
# LBXTCD 14.06154

# The number of observations exceeding the 50th percentile differs for each file, which I can't claim to understand.

# I removed the 16 ties, but no help. Do the ties and/or different number of observations above/below prevent the svydesigns from being combined?
nrow(subset(ImputedList0102[[1]], LBXTCD > 13.5554))
# [1] 516
nrow(subset(ImputedList0102[[2]], LBXTCD > 14.06154))
# [1] 512


I'm hoping someone can point me to some gross error I'm making or another function parameter or data manipulation or another survey-savvy method altogether to calculate a 50th percentile across multiply imputed data files. Thanks for any advice,

Brennan

Hi Shashi,
The assumption that anyone on the list apart from yourself knows what
"some calculation" involves is incorrect. I suspect that "what is
wrong" may be one of two things:

1) "some calculation" includes a very large number of operations,
perhaps leading to "disk-thrashing" when your 16GB of memory is full
of intermediate values. There is no software problem, buy more
hardware.

2) "some calculation" is a very inefficient method of getting the
result you want. If this method is revealed to us, we may be able to
help you.

Jim

 Hard to say.  Works for me on a clean MacOS install of R 3.3/lme4/
lmerTest.

Hi All,


I have the following dataset:


> str(pfi_v3)
'data.frame': 714 obs. of  8 variables:
 $ project_id             : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ project_lat            : num  51.4 51.5 52.2 51.5 53.5 ...

 $ contract_type          : Factor w/ 2 levels "Lumpsum","Turnkey": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...


I'm using following commands to create training and test sets:

split <- sample.split(pfi_v3, SplitRatio = 0.8)
trainPFI <- subset(pfi_v3, split == TRUE)
testPFI <- subset(pfi_v3, split == FALSE)


I am using several predictive models to estimate delay in projects.


The commands are given as below:


1. Simple linear regression

lm_m <- lm(project_delay ~ project_lon +

                                                     project_lat +

                                                     project_duration +

                                                     sector +

                                                     contract_type +

                                                     capital_value,

                         data = trainPFI)

lm_pred <- predict(lm_m2, newdata = testPFI)


2. Regression tree

tree_m <- rpart(project_delay ~ project_lon +
                                                          project_lat +
                                                          project_duration +
                                                          sector +
                                                          contract_type +
                                                          capital_value,
                                data = trainPFI)

tree_pred <- predict(tree_m2, newdata = testPFI)

3. Cp optimsed regression tree

train_m <- train(project_delay ~ project_lon +
                                                           project_lat +
                                                           project_duration +
                                                           sector +
                                                           contract_type +
                                                           capital_value,
                     data = trainPFI,
                     method="rpart",
                     trControl=tr.control, tuneGrid = cp.grid)


train_pred <- predict(tr_m, newdata = testPFI)


4. Random Forest

rf_m <- randomForest(project_delay ~ project_lon +
                       project_lat +

                     ntree = 2000)

rf_pred <- predict(rf_m, newdata = testPFI)

5. Conditional Forest
cf_m <- cforest(project_delay ~ project_lon +
                       project_lat +
                       project_duration +

                     controls=cforest_unbiased(ntree=2000, mtry=3))

cf_pred <- predict(cf_m, testPFI, OOB=TRUE, type = "response")

That is it.


Now I want to create a new data frame to combine the actual and predicted values such that the new frame has the following columns:

$project_id

$actual_delay

$lm_predicted_delay

$tree_predicted_delay

$train_predicted_delay

$rf_predicted_delay

$cf_predicted_delay


I want to use this dataframe to draw the line chart to compare predictions.


How to achieve this?


Any help will be highly appreciated.


Many Thanks and


Kind Regards

Pls don't mind the typo in predict() functions for some of the models.

Hi Shashi,
First off, keep the thread on the list. Compare the two statements below:

Jim:  If this method is revealed to us, we may be able to help you.

Shashi: "if this method reveal to me i can help"

Regardless, I will attempt to help. This looks like number 2 - inefficient
code

You appear to be forming a very large vector bit by bit. This is _very_
inefficient. If you want to get the data frame "matrixdata" as a vector:

# this may work
fitness_1_data<-unlist(matrixdata)
# if not, try this
fitness_1_data<-as.vector(as.matrix(matrixdata))

This is written to a file and the file is read and again reformatted into
vectors for processing. If you are able, try to create a _small_ data set
that will be processed in the same way as "matrixdata" (e.g. a 10x10 data
frame):

smalldata<-as.data.frame(matrix(sample(1:100,100,nrow=10))
names(smalldata)<-paste("Col",1:10,sep="")

This will allow you to try out your code without spending a day on each
run. For instance, you can probably substitute:

matrixdata2<-matrixdata[,-1]

for a lot of the code in the second half of your script.

Jim

is the `with` not passing make.formula( get( 'var_name' ) ) through to
svyquantile for some reason?  does this work?

MIcombine( with(des, svyquantile(~LBXTCD, .5)))


if that's not it, could you make a minimal reproducible example that
includes the data download?  code to download and import nhanes here

Subject: [R] physical constraint with gam
Message-ID: <CAF1jk_=312-4GEwpeJM2UaOojnSE_6PxLo6YU2ysjGdHKBt3UQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Just getting into using GAM using the mgcv package. I've generated some
models and extracted the splines for each of the variables and started
visualizing them. I'm noticing that one of my variables is physically
unrealistic.

In the example below, my interpretation of the following plot is that the
y-axis is basically the equivalent of a "parameter" value of a GLM; in GAM
this value can change as the functional relationship changes between x and
y. In my case, I am predicting snowdepth based on the fractional snow
covered area. In no case will snowdepth realistically decrease for a unit
increase in fsca so my question is: *Is there a way to constrain the spline
to positive values? *

Thanks
Dominik

library(mgcv)
library(dplyr)

extract_splines=function(mdl){
  sterms=predict(mdl,type='terms')
  datplot=cbind(sterms,mdl$model) %>% tbl_df
  datplot$intercept=attr(sterms,'constant')
  datplot$yhat=rowSums(sterms)+attr(sterms,'constant')
  return(datplot)
}
dat=data_frame(snowdepth=runif(100,min =
0.001,max=6.7),fsca=runif(100,0.01,.99))

It would be helpful if you could articulate the issue.

I'm assuming that the comment character is actually something that was inserted in hte process of stripping hte HTML from this posting.

It throws an error when removed:

Error in partialPlot(x = model, pred.data = dataSet, x.var = "X1", plot = F) : 
  object 'model' not found

Try changing to eval(x.bar)

I would think that the mass or volume of snow might not realistically decrease with increase in area but I see no reason why increasing the area might not be associated with an decrease in mean depth. Depth would be "orthogonal" to area.

Subject: [R] how to manipulate ... in the argument list
Message-ID: <CAAjnpdg3XrWjagscn7shX1TWm8TEY0=VcWvUy29j_ai_+NmdOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am looking for a documentation describing how to manipulate the
"..." . Searching R-intro.html gives to many not relevant hits for
"..."

What I want to do is something like this :


image.2 <- function(x, col , ...){
 # function is manipulating colors (adding a few)
 # since it changes colors it needs to update breaks if defined.

  breaks <- list(...)$breaks

 if( !is.null( list(...)$breaks ) ){
    #manipulate breaks

   image(x, col, breaks = breaks ,...)

  }else{
     image(x,col ,...)
  }
}

but in order to get it working I will need to remove breaks from ...
since otherwise I am getting multiple defined argument for breaks.

So how to manipulate the "..." argument? Or should I use a different pattern

best

Message-ID: <5732F730.9000800@bath.edu>

The spline having a positive value is not the same as a glm coefficient 
having a positive value. When you plot a smooth, say s(x), that is 
equivalent to plotting the line 'beta * x' in a GLM. It is not 
equivalent to plotting 'beta'. The smooths in a gam are (usually) 
subject to `sum-to-zero' identifiability constraints to avoid 
confounding via the intercept, so they are bound to be negative over 
some part of the covariate range. For example, if I have a model y ~ 
s(x) + s(z), I can't estimate the mean level for s(x) and the mean level 
for s(z) as they are completely confounded, and confounded with the 
model intercept term.

I suppose that if you want to interpret the smooths as glm parameters 
varying with the covariate they relate to then you can do, by setting 
the model up as a varying coefficient model, using the `by' argument to 
's'...

gam(snowdepth~s(fsca,by=fsca),data=dat)


this model is `snowdepth_i = f(fsca_i) * fsca_i + e_i' . s(fsca,by=fsca) 
is not confounded with the intercept, so no constraint is needed or 
applied, and you can now interpret the smooth like a local GLM coefficient.

best,
Simon

Hi Witold,
You could try Ben Bolker's "clean.args" function in the plotrix package.

I have achieved this use case by writing the following commands:

all_predictions <- data.frame(pid = testPFI$project_id, actual_delay = testPFI$project_delay,lm_pred, tree_pred, best_tree_pred, rf_pred)

str(all_predictions)

all_pred <- sqldf("SELECT pid, actual_delay, ROUND(lm_pred,2) lm_pred,
                               ROUND(tree_pred,2) tree_pred,
                               ROUND(best_tree_pred,2) train_pred,
                               ROUND(rf_pred,2) rf_pred
                     FROM all_predictions
                      ORDER BY actual_delay")
all_pred

#Plotting all the predictions on the graph
ggplot(all_pred, aes(x=pid)) + geom_line(aes(y=actual_delay), colour="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y=lm_pred), colour="red", size=1)  +
  geom_line(aes(y=tree_pred), colour="green", size=1)  +
  geom_line(aes(y=train_pred), colour="yellow", size=1)  +
  geom_line(aes(y=rf_pred), colour="black", size=1)

So I am done.

Many Thanks and

If breaks is an argument that image.2 uses, you should just list it 
explicitly, and it won't become part of ... .

However, if you really want to do what you describe, you can do it using 
do.call.  Replace

image(x, col, breaks = breaks, ...)

with

dots <- list(...)
dots$breaks <- NULL
do.call(image, c(list(x, col, breaks = breaks), dots))

>

I'd recommend a different pattern, i.e. include breaks as an argument, 
and possibly use is.missing(breaks) to determine when it has not been used.

Hi all,

I have a plot for TSTMean vs. SNRMean and both of these variables are factors. How can I use Logistic Regression for factor variables?
Currently I use model=lm(TSTMean~SNRMean,data=df) but when I check summary(model) I get this error: r error in quartile.default (resid) factors are not allowed
 
thanks for any help,
Elahe

Thanks David - my earlier response to Bert contains the resolution.
partialPlot was commented out deliberately as it was the target function
who's behaviour I was replicating in testFunc. The original behaviour, ie.
printing 'X1' was correct, and the do.call fix yields this same response
when testFunc is called within lapply. As I'm replicating partialPlot, no
changes can be made to testFunc (eg. your removal of 'substitute')
otherwise I'd need to patch the randomForest::partialPlot package &
function. The correct patch would be to change the eval to use the parent
environment, the subtitue should remain.

See the resolution here (jcheng beat r-help to it this time!)

First of all, lm() is for linear regression, not logistic regression. 
For logistic regression you need to use glm() and make sure you set the 
correct family (see ?glm). I don't recall if glm() accepts a factor 
outcome but if not, you would need to re-code it to 0/1.

R-help is not stack exchange, where people get "reputation" points for 
good answers,
and R-help often sees a lot of unhelpful and sometimes unkind answers.
So, when someone is exceptionally helpful, it is worthwhile 
acknowledging it
in public, as I do now, with my "Best of R-help" award to Bob Rudis.

Not only did he point me to RSelenium, but he wrote a complete solution
to the problem, and gave me the generated data on a github link.
It was slick, and I learned a lot from it.

best,
-Michael

Thanks for looking. No, for the quantiles it fails to instantiate the collection of designs correctly, whether hard-coding the variable name or using make.formula. 'with' passes make.formula correctly when calculating the mean, e.g. this works:

MIcombine( with(des, svymean(make.formula(get('var_name')))))

# Here's a reproducible example.

DF1 <- data.frame(SDMVPSU = c(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2), 
                  SDMVSTRA = c(22, 20, 24, 18, 20, 22, 20, 24, 18, 20),
                  WTSPO2YR = c(252605, 82199, 24946, 147236, 3679, 294959, 65085, 21765, 197775, 49931),
                  LBXTCD = c(20.4, 29.7, 8.8, 18.0, 22.2, 10.4, 43.9, 15.3, 13.8, 84.5))

DF2 <- data.frame(SDMVPSU = c(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2), 
                  SDMVSTRA = c(22, 20, 24, 18, 20, 22, 20, 24, 18, 20),
                  WTSPO2YR = c(252605, 82199, 24946, 147236, 3679, 294959, 65085, 21765, 197775, 49931),
                  LBXTCD = c(21.9, 29.7, 9.2, 5.9, 32.8, 8.9, 43.9, 7.4, 10.5, 84.5))

var_name <- "LBXTCD"

# Individually svyquantile (and svymean) work:
des_single1 <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=Df1_red, nest=TRUE)
svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), des_single1, c(.5), na.rm = FALSE)

svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), des_single2, c(.5), na.rm = FALSE)

Imputed_list <- c()
Imputed_list[[1]] <- DF1
Imputed_list[[2]] <- DF2

# svymean works (so the svydesign object is fine?) but svyquantile doesn't:
des_mult <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=imputationList(Imputed_list), nest=TRUE)
M_mean <- with(des_mult, svymean(make.formula(get('var_name'))))

M_quantile <- with(des_mult, svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), quantiles = c(.5)))

is the `with` not passing make.formula( get( 'var_name' ) ) through to svyquantile for some reason?  does this work?

MIcombine( with(des, svyquantile(~LBXTCD, .5)))



if that's not it, could you make a minimal reproducible example that includes the data download?  code to download and import nhanes here

Hello, and thank you for considering this question:

The svystat object created with multiply imputed NHANES data files is failing on calling survey::svyquantile. I'm wondering if I'm diagnosing the issue correctly, whether the behavior is expected, and whether y'all might have any ideas for workarounds.

I'm following T. Lumley's general method outlined here: 
http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/old-survey/svymi.html <http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/old-survey/svymi.html>, but with data files I've imputed myself on the 2001/2002 biennial. Each file has 1081 observations and no missing values.

### Create the survey design object with list of imputed data files ImputedList0102.
des <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=imputationList(ImputedList0102), nest=TRUE)


### Blood analyte of interest
var_name <- "LBXTCD" # analyte in blood serum

### All is well calculating the mean:
M <- with(des, svymean(make.formula(get('var_name'))))
summary(M)
Result <- MIcombine(M)
Result$coefficients
# LBXTCD
# 17.41635


### but svystat object fails to calculate a 50th percentile:
### it fails when hard-coding the name rather than using make.formula;
### it fails regardless of number of files or choices in handling ties or interval type.
### There are 16 ties in each data file.
M1 <- with(des, svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), quantiles = c(.5)))
summary(M1)

#     Length Class  Mode
#[1,] 1      -none- numeric
#[2,] 1      -none- numeric
#[3,] 1      -none- numeric


### The quantile is successfully calculated on one file at a time, however, and is different for each file.
### (had thought perhaps there was a lack-of-variance issue). The quantile calculated on each file
### is the same regardless of interval.type.
des_single1 <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=ImputedList0102[[1]], nest=TRUE)
svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), des_single1, c(.5))
# 0.5
# LBXTCD 13.5554


des_single2 <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, strat=~SDMVSTRA, weight=~WTSPO2YR, data=ImputedList0102[[2]], nest=TRUE)
svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')), des_single2, c(.5))
# 0.5
# LBXTCD 14.06154

# The number of observations exceeding the 50th percentile differs for each file, which I can't claim to understand.

# I removed the 16 ties, but no help. Do the ties and/or different number of observations above/below prevent the svydesigns from being combined?
nrow(subset(ImputedList0102[[1]], LBXTCD > 13.5554))
# [1] 516
nrow(subset(ImputedList0102[[2]], LBXTCD > 14.06154))
# [1] 512


I'm hoping someone can point me to some gross error I'm making or another function parameter or data manipulation or another survey-savvy method altogether to calculate a 50th percentile across multiply imputed data files. Thanks for any advice,

hi, you want   se=T

M_quantile <- with(des_mult, svyquantile(make.formula(get('var_name')),
quantiles = c(.5),se=T))
MIcombine(M_quantile)



Multiple imputation results:
      with(des_mult, svyquantile(make.formula(get("var_name")), quantiles =
c(0.5),
    se = T))
      MIcombine.default(M_quantile)
       results       se
LBXTCD 12.7978 6.917285

Hi Sarah,

yes, I followed your suggestion.

If I do exactly what is in the example of the documentation:

sink("C:/Temp/sink-examp.txt")
i <- 1:10
outer(i, i, "*")
sink()
unlink("C:/Temp/sink-examp.txt")

it does not write anything, i. e. no file is created in "C:/Temp/". The 
script is executed without an error or warning message.

If I run

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("C:/Temp/all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")  # I think ,this was your suggestion
sink()
unlink("C:/Temp/all.Rout")

the script is executed without error or warning message, the file is 
created in "C:/Temp/" but if I try to open it right away after the script 
is done the message

DE: "Auf das Dokument "C:\Temp\all.Rout" kann nicht zugegriffen werden, da 
es von einer anderen Anwendung verwendet wird."
EN: "Cannot access the document "C:\Temp\all.Rout" cause it is used by 
another application."

What do I do wrong?

Kind regards

Georg

But did you do that ^^ as I suggested?


If you start a message sink with
sink(zz, type="message")
as you did, you need to explicitly close that stream. Just using
sink()
doesn't do it.

Duncan,

thanks for the hint.

I have done it correctly in R fashion

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("C:/Temp/all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")
sink()
unlink("C:/Temp/all.Rout")

But the error persits.

Kind regards

Georg

Note that the backslash should be doubled (so it isn't interpreted as an 
escape for the "m" that follows it), or replaced with a forward slash.

Hi Simon, Thanks for this explanation.
To make sure I understand, another way of explaining the y axis in my
original example is that it is the contribution to snowdepth relative to
the other variables (the example only had fsca, but my actual case has a
couple others). i.e. a negative s(fsca) of -0.5 simply means snowdepth 0.5
units below the intercept+s(x_i), where s(x_i) could also be negative in
the case where total snowdepth is less than the intercept value.

The use of by=fsca is really useful for interpreting the marginal impact of
the different variables. With my actual data, the term s(fsca):fsca is
never negative, which is much more intuitive. Is it appropriate to compare
magnitudes of e.g. s(x2):x2 / mean(x2) and s(x2):x2 / mean(x2)  where
mean(x_i) are the mean of the actual data?

Lastly, how would these two differ: s(x1,by=x2); or s(x1,by=x1)*s(x2,by=x2)
since interactions are surely present and i'm not sure if a linear
combination is enough.

Thanks!
Dominik

Thanks Bob/hrbrmstr;

At this point I got an error:

>    remDr$open()
[1] "Connecting to remote server"
Undefined error in RCurl call.Error in queryRD(paste0(serverURL, "/session"), "POST", qdata = toJSON(serverOpts)) : 

Running R 3.0.0 on a Mac (El Cap) in the R.app GUI.

Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)

I asked myself: What additional information is needed to debug this? But then I thought I had a responsibility to search for earlier reports of this error on a Mac, and there were many. After reading this thread: https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/issues/54  I decided to try creating an "alias", mac-speak for a symlink, and put that symlink in my working directory (with no further chmod security efforts). I restarted R and re-ran the code which opened a Firefox browser window and then proceeded to page through many pages. Eventually, however it errors out with this message:

Error in bind_rows(tabs) : object 'tabs' not found


There doesn't seem to be any trace of objects from all the downloading efforts that I could find. When I changed both instances of '69' to '30' it no longer errors out. Is there supposed to be an initial step of finding out how many pages are actually there befor setting the two iteration limits? I'm wondering if that code could be modified to return some intermediate values that would be amenable to further assembly efforts in the event of errors?

Sincerely;
David.

Hey David,

I'm on a Mac as well but have never had to tweak anything to get
[R]Selenium to work (but this is one reason I try to avoid solutions
involving RSelenium as they are pretty fragile IMO).

The site itself has "P?gina 1 de 69" at the top which is where i got
the "69" from and I just re-ran the code in a 100% clean env (on a
completely different Mac) and it worked fine.

I did neglect to put my session info up before (apologies):

(and, wow, does that tiny snippet of code end up using alot of pkgs)

I had actually started with smaller snippets to test. The code got
uglier due to the way the site paginates (it loads 10-entries worth of
data on to a single page but requires a server call for the next 10).

I also keep firefox scarily out-of-date (back in the 33's rev) b/c I
only use it with RSelenium (not a big fan of the browser). Let me
update to the 46-series and see if I can replicate.

After reading this thread: https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/issues/54  I decided to try creating an "alias", mac-speak for a symlink, and put that symlink in my working directory (with no further chmod security efforts). I restarted R and re-ran the code which opened a Firefox browser window and then proceeded to page through many pages. Eventually, however it errors out with this message:

Is there supposed to be an initial step of finding out how many pages are actually there befor setting the two iteration limits? I'm wondering if that code could be modified to return some intermediate values that would be amenable to further assembly efforts in the event of errors?

I upgraded ffox to the 46-series and intermittently received the same
error. But by adding a `Sys.sleep(1)` to the final `if`:

  if ((i %% 10) == 0) {
    ref <- remDr$findElements("xpath", ".//a[.='...']")
    ref[[length(ref)]]$clickElement()
    Sys.sleep(1)
  }

I was able to reproduce my original, successful outcome. I think it
has something to do with the page not being fully loaded when the the
driver tries to get the page content. Go multithreading! My choice of
1s was arbitrary. Longer == better chance of it working more often.

This <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27080920/how-to-check-if-page-finished-loading-in-rselenium>
would probably also be better (waiting for a full page load signal),
but I try to not use [R]Selenium at all if it can be helped.

Sounds like it would be helpful to find out exactly which process is
holding on to the file in order to figure out what's going on. From a
quick look, it seems that

  http://superuser.com/questions/117902/find-out-which-process-is-locking-a-file-or-folder-in-windows

gives some useful info on how to track down the process that looks the file.

Dear R-help

I would like to split long string at specified precomputed positions.
'substring' needs beginings and ends. Is there a native function which
accepts positions so I don't have to count second argument?

For example I have vector of possitions pos<-c(5,10,19). Substring
needs input first=c(1,6,11) and last=c(5,10,19). There is no problem
to write my own function. Just asking.

Derek

Dunno -- but you might have a look at Hadley Wickham's 'stringr' package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/stringr.pdf

Here is my attempt at function which computes margins from positions.

Hi Jan,
This might be helpful:

chop_string<-function(x,ends) {
 starts<-c(1,ends[-length(ends)]-1)
 return(substring(x,starts,ends))

I think you can simply this. just create a function (I'll call it begs) 
to compute the beginning positions.

     begs <- function(x) c(0,x[-length(x)])+1

Then, then use that function in your call to str_sub

     str_sub(test_string,begs(ends),ends) %>% print


Hope this is helpful,

Hi again,
I'm looking for some clarification on 2 things.
1. On that last note, I realize that s(x1,x2) would be the other obvious
interaction to compare with - and I see that you recommend te(x1,x2) if
they are not on the same scale.
2. If s(x1,by=x1) gives you a "parameter" value similar to a GLM when you
plot s(x1):x1, why does my function above return the same yhat as
predict(mdl,type='response') ?  Shouldn't each of the terms need to be
multiplied by the variable value before applying
rowSums()+attr(sterms,'constant') ??
Thanks again
Dominik

Subject: [R] R_DirtyImage and Rprof
Message-ID: <5733ECD9.3000509@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have some code which was running in interactive mode while Rprof(..., 
line.profiling = TRUE). Near the end of my script, it opens up a 
pipe(..., open = "w") to a perl script, and at that point the execution 
gets stuck using 100% cpu.

(The perl script itself never showed up in pstree, as far as I can tell).

I did a "tail -f" on the file being written to by Rprof, and it was 
reporting "sys.save.image" over and over, and in fact an ".RData" file 
appeared when I had not asked for one, and I was able to load it later.

This got me curious, as nowhere in my code do I directly use that 
function. Looking through the source code for R, it appears that 
"sys.save.image" is called whenever an R_DirtyImage condition is triggered.

This was using R version 3.2.2 under RHEL. My efforts to create a 
reproducible example of this behavior have thus far been unsuccessful.

My questions: is there any documentation for R_DirtyImage, and how 
plausible is it that the R_DirtyImage condition was triggered by 
something Rprof did? The reason for my conjecture is that 
sys.save.image() calls closeAllConnections(), which I imagine might have 
interfered with the pipe that was open for writing, thus causing the 
stuck execution at that point.

If so, any advice for avoiding the R_DirtyImage condition while profiling?

If not, any conjectures for what might actually be going on? For what 
it's worth, I have observed a similar situation when using Rprof + 
system() instead of pipe(); for example:

Look for the SimDesign package.  Makes this easy to do.  No loops, no 
pain.  There are some good examples on the wiki for this.

fact, I would like to know if there are exclusive CAS in a specific 
treatment. 

Is it possible to do it inside R?

Could you share a code ou paper ou tutorial to do that? Or point me out a
R package/library?

Thank you very much!

Subject: [R] how to manipulate ... in the argument list

Duncan suggested to use the argument explicitly and combine it with
the missing function which is for this problem also my preferred
solution:


image.2 <- function(x, col , breaks, ...){
  # function is manipulating colors (adding a few)
  # since it changes colors it needs to update breaks if defined.

  if( !missing(breaks) ){
     #manipulate breaks

    image(x, col, breaks  ,...)

   }else{
      image(x,col ,...)
   }
}

It is good to know that I also could have used do.call.

I also learned yesterday that it is better to search for dot dot dot
argument or for elipsis instead of  ...

best

Hi Henrik, Jim, Sarah, Duncan,
Hi All,

I have tried the built-in solution using PowerShell:

$lockedFile="C:\Windows\System32\wshtcpip.dll" 
Get-Process | foreach{$processVar = $_;$_.Modules | foreach{if($_.FileName 
-eq $lockedFile){$processVar.Name + " PID:" + $processVar.id}}}

It did not show any processes.

Then I tried the solution using "RessourceMonitor". There I found two 
processes:

rstudio.exe
rsession.exe

Right-clicking on rstudio.exe and selecting "Warteschlange analysieren" (= 
analyse queue?) showed nothing. Right-clicking on rsession.exe and 
selecting "Warteschlage" said:

"Mindestens ein Thread von rsession.exe wartet auf die Fertigstellung von 
Netzwerk E/A". (= "At least one thread of "rsession.exe" is waiting for 
finishing a network i/o operation").

Putting rsession.exe into the search field of the handles tap of 
RessourceMonitor gave no results. No handles were identified.

I can not follow the suggestions where installation of software is 
required due to security rules of the company I work for.

I had a look at different R versions on my machine:

1) R i386 3.2.2
2) R i386 3.2.4 (revised)
3) R i386 3.2.5
4) R x54 3.2.2
5) R x64 3.2.4 (revised)
6) R x64 3.2.5

I did 

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("C:/Temp/all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")
sink()
unlink("C:/Temp/all.Rout")

on R i386 3.2.2 and R x64 3.2.2 directly without RStudio. In both cases 
the file was locked.

Adding

close(zz)

solved the problem in both versions.

Encouraged by this I tired (successivly refered to as "complete code")

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("C:/Temp/all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")
sink()
unlink("C:/Temp/all.Rout")
close(zz)

on R i386 3.2.4 (revised) and R x64 3.2.4 (revised) without RStudio. Works 
in both cases. The same with R i386 3.2.5 and R x64 3.2.5 each without 
RStudio.

It did the same with RStudio altering the R version in the RStudio session 
using "complete code". The results are:

R i386 3.2.2: OK
R. x64 3.2.2: OK
R i386 3.2.4 (revised): OK
R x64 3.2.4 (revised): OK
R i386 3.2.5: OK
R x64 3.2.5: OK

This got me lost. I had tried the complete code the last days a hundred 
times. It never worked.

Then I restarted my machine powering up RStudio x64 3.2.5 using the 
"complete code" and ... it worked.

I have no idea what was wrong the last days.

As far as I can say today the documentation of ?sink in R is currently

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")
sink()
file.show("all.Rout")

and should be - in my opinion  - supplemented with

close(zz).

Any thoughts?

Kind regards

Georg

Sounds like it would be helpful to find out exactly which process is
holding on to the file in order to figure out what's going on. From a
quick look, it seems that

  
http://superuser.com/questions/117902/find-out-which-process-is-locking-a-file-or-folder-in-windows


gives some useful info on how to track down the process that looks the 
file.

and why can't you simply use base R's  substr() function ?
Packages (such as 'stringr' in this case) have their uses and
great merits, but using base R seems more sensical to me (also
slightly more future-proof).

Yes, I'd think so , because that was also my quick thought when
I read the OP's question.

Well, did you ever lookup what unlink() does ?
I save you the time : it does *REMOVE* a file.

So no wonder that you don't see any result after executing the
above R code block..

Hi Martin,

many thanks for following-up on my question.

I did it again:

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("C:/Temp/all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
## back to the console
sink(type = "message")
sink()
close(zz)

This works.

I tried several other combinations of the commands, e.g.

## capture all the output to a file.
zz <- file("C:/Temp/all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
try(log("a"))
close(zz)

Does not work.

As far as I have understood right now, I have to loosen the connection of 
the streams with sink(zz, type = "message") and sink() before I can close 
the file connection itself.

If I did it like in the last example the connection to the file is lost 
and then the connection to the streams of sink() can not be recovered. 
This will last until the R session is closed and opened again.

To me it looks like I need to learn more about the operation of R under 
the hood.

Kind regards

Georg

Subject: [R] building a spatial matrix
Message-ID: <CAOZPQW7DOicT9pS8H2BA3gxnJLg0wYTu9UhinwpgywcSDGoKFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a sample of 1327  locations, each one idetified by an id and a
numerical code.

I need to build a spatial matrix, say, M, i.e. a 1327x1327 matrix
collecting distances among the locations.

M(i,i) should be 0, M(i,j) should contain the distance among location i and
j

I shoud use data organized in the following way:

1) id_cell contains the identifier (id) of each location (1...1327) and the
numerical code of the location (f_cell) (see head of id_cell below)

> head(id_cell)
     id  f_cell
1    1   2120
12  2     204
22  3   2546
24  4   1327
34  5   1729
43  6   2293

2) censDist contains, for each location identified by its numerical code,
the distance to other locations (censDist has 1.5 million rows). The
head(consist) below, for example, reads like this:

location 2924 has a distance to 2732 of 1309.7525
location 2924 has a distance to 2875 of 696.2891,
etc.

> head(censDist)
  f_cell f  _cell_neigh  distance
1   2924         2732   1309.7525
2   2924         2875     696.2891
3   2924         2351   1346.0561
4   2924         2350   1296.9804
5   2924         2725   1278.1877
6   2924         2721   1346.9126


Basically, for every location in  id_cell I should pick up the distance to
other locations in id_cell from censDist, and allocate it in M

I have not come up with a satisfactory vectorizion of this problem and
using a loop is out of question.

Thanks for your help
Mario

I don't see any reason why a loop is out of the question, and
answering would have been much easier if you'd included the requested
reproducible data, but what about this?

This solution is robust to pairs from idcell being absent in censDist,
and to the difference from A to B being different than the distance
from B to A, but not to A-B appearing twice. If that's possible,
you'll need to figure out how to manage it.

# create some fake data

idcell <- data.frame(
  id = seq_len(5),
  fcell = sample(1:100, 5))

censDist <- expand.grid(fcell=seq_len(100), cellneigh=seq_len(100))
censDist$distance <- runif(nrow(censDist))

# assemble the non-symmetric distance matrix
result <- subset(censDist, fcell %in% idcell$fcell & cellneigh %in%
idcell$fcell)
result.m <- matrix(NA, nrow=nrow(idcell), ncol=nrow(idcell))
result.m[factor(result$fcell), factor(result$cellneigh)] <- result$distance

Here's the full log when I run it.

Subject: [R] Bootstrap Methods for Confidence Intervals -- glmnet
Message-ID: <20160512144952.GA3271@localhost.localdomain>

Dear All,
Please have a look at the code at the end of the email.
It is just an example of regression based on glmnet with some
artificial data.
My question is how I can evaluate the uncertainty of the prediction
yhat.

It looks like there are some reasons for not providing a standard
error estimate, see e.g.



http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12937331/how-to-get-statistical-summary-information-from-glmnet-model
and
https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1vg8k0/standard_errors_in_glmnet/

However, from what I read in this thesis

https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/153099/133417/phd_unimi_R07738.pdf

(see sections 3.2 and 3.3)

and in the quoted papers

http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fienberg/Statistics36-756/Efron1979.pdf
and
http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2010-138-12/S0002-9939-2010-10474-4/S0002-9939-2010-10474-4.pdf

there are some bootstrap methods that are quite general and applicable
well beyond the case of glmnet.
Is there anything already implemented to help me out? Is anybody aware
of this?
Cheers

Lorenzo

Looks to me like something outside of R is blocking network access by R. That could be anything from you don't have networking setup to some security policy or firewall configuration. I doubt this will be the right place to resolve those issues.

Lorenzo:

This is a complicated and subtle question that I believe is mostly
about statistical methodology, not R. I would suggest that you post
your query to stats.stackexchange.com rather than here in order to
determine *what* you should do. Then, if necessary, you can come back
here to ask about *how* to do it in R (with code from your failed
attempts, etc.).

Better yet, you might wish to have this discussion with a local
expert, if you can find one.

Cheers,
Bert

do you have any success when choosing a non-https mirror, #28 in your

Subject: [R] What is the easiest way to turn a dataframe into a barplot?
Message-ID: <056474CC-7FCD-48FF-8D21-CDE4A83F66A5@gmail.com>

Hello, I can't post my code since it's on a work computer.

But basically, I have a dataframe that has two columns, one is a string and the other is an integer.  I want to turn this into a vertival barplot where on the x-axis I have the string in the first columb and then the plot will display the integer count.

I have found many examples online and most of those matched either odd edge cases or putting the data into a format that strips out some of the data and I can't use it later.

This should be a breeze, what am I missing?

Does this do what you want?

z <- data.frame(Name=c("One","Three","Twelve","Eleven"), Count=c(1,3,12,11))
with(z, barplot(Count, names=Name, horiz=TRUE))
with(z, barplot(Count, names=Name, horiz=TRUE, las=1))

You are missing a reproducible example. We don't care what is on your home or work computer... we just need to have clear communication, so make up some data that shows the problem and some  code to go with it. You MIGHT have to show some data that does not have the problem in order to highlight the problem for us.

setInternet2() first thing after launching R might fix that.

Martin Morgan, I tried an HTTP mirror and it worked.
What could be the problem and how to fix?
Also, should I ignore the warning about ignoring environment value of R_HOME?
Thanks.

Without showing a data sample, no one can really do more than guess
what you are asking.  Among other things, no one "turns" a
dataframe "into" a barplot, ever.  It would defeat the purpose of
collecting the data to begin with.  It is also unclear what data the
process could strip out, or why you can't use the data again, unless
you are attempting to overwrite the dataframe with the bar plot.  

A barplot is a visual summary of data. So, best to bite the bullet and
supply an example. That way we can understand what you are attempting to
summarize.  As long as it has a similar structure and data types, you
can make it up. You would also benefit a great deal from reading up on
R and communicating in a manner that the community can follow. Sadly, no
specialized community exists without its own specialized jargon and
R-help is an intersection of at least two such communities.

Hi!

I also have problems when I try to install packages. I use R (v. 3.3.0) on
iMac (v. 10.11.4).
For instance:

The problem is in the warning message

1: In download.file(url, destfile = f, quiet = TRUE) :
URL 'https://cran.r-project.org/CRAN_mirrors.csv': status was 'Problem 
with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)'

and an easier way to reproduce / troubleshoot the problem is

     download.file("https://cran.r-project.org/CRAN_mirrors.csv", 
tempfile())

The details of this process are described in ?download.file. My guess 
would be that you have 'libcurl' available

 > capabilities()["libcurl"]
libcurl
    TRUE

that it supports https (mine does, in the protocol attribute):

 > libcurlVersion()
[1] "7.35.0"
attr(,"ssl_version")
[1] "OpenSSL/1.0.1f"
attr(,"libssh_version")
[1] ""
attr(,"protocols")
  [1] "dict"   "file"   "ftp"    "ftps"   "gopher" "http"   "https" 
"imap"
  [9] "imaps"  "ldap"   "ldaps"  "pop3"   "pop3s"  "rtmp"   "rtsp" 
"smtp"
[17] "smtps"  "telnet" "tftp"

and that you have outdated or other CA certificates problem, with some 
hints for troubleshooting in the first and subsequent paragraphs of the 
'Secure URL' section.

It depends on why you set the value in your environment in the first 
place; maybe you were trying to use a particular installation of R, but 
setting R_HOME is not the way to do that (I use an alias, e.g., 
R-3.3='~/bin/R-3-3-branch/bin/R --no-save --no-restore --silent')

Hi,

Here is the Biostrings solution in case you need to chop a long
string into hundreds or thousands of fragments (a situation where
base::substring() is very inefficient):

   library(Biostrings)

   ## Call as.character() on the result if you want it back as
   ## a character vector.
   fast_chop_string <- function(x, ends)
   {
     if (!is(x, "XString"))
         x <- as(x, "XString")
     extractAt(x, at=PartitioningByEnd(ends))
   }

Will be much faster than substring (e.g. 100x or 1000x) when
chopping a string like a Human chromosome into hundreds or
thousands of fragments.

Biostrings is a Bioconductor package:

   https://bioconductor.org/packages/Biostrings

Cheers,
H.

- you'd probably use te(x1,x2) unless x1 and x2 are really on the same 
scale, in which case s(x1,x2) might be appropriate. The `by' variable 
trick is probably not going to work so well for interactions, however 
(it's not so clear what the by variable should be).

Subject: [R] How to program friction model(kind of cencored regression )
Message-ID: <CAF=n1M3vXU52bF-OhacxGqysjX0WEOP4mZsb=UUurLWL91trAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am going to program (what is called) the ?friction model? in economics
and statistics. This model can be used for analysing the government
intervention. It looks like tobit but different. I can not deal with this
model by any R library. This model assume that government intervenes in the
market only when a certain condition is fulfilled.

For example, INT is the amount of government intervention in the market.
The equation to be estimated is:
(1) *INT = a + b*X +e*  where INT indicates (actual) intervention amount
and X is control variable.

Let INT* denote the desirable intervention amount ? this is the same as the
right hand side of equation (1) excluding error terms. Then the acutal
value, i.e., INT, have a differnt value depending on whether INT* reach the
threshold. That is, government is assumed to intervene only when INT* is
larger than the upper positive threshold(p>0) or less than the lower
negative threshold(n<0).

That is, there are 3 cases.
(2)
INT = INT* - p + e             if INT*>p : intervention
INT= 0 if n<=INT*<=p        no intervention
INT= INT* + n +e               if INT*<n : intervention

The parameters(a,b, p, n) in (1) and (2) can be estimated by maximum
likelihood.

does  anyone  knows how to program this model or has complete code of this
model ?
Many thanks in advance !!
Ama

Is there a way to change TSTMean into numeric without those NAs?

You appear to have a comma as the decimal marker, so you can use 
type.convert(as.character(df$TSTMean), dec = ",", as.is = TRUE) instead 
of as.numeric().

A simpler approach might be to avoid getting the factor in the first 
place; if you read this data using read.table, there is the dec option 
to recognize a comma as the decimal separator.

Hi,

First, how did you get the data into R? 

I am going to guess that you used ?read.table or ?read.csv, which by default, will convert character values into factors (see the 'as.is' argument).

Second, by default, the decimal character in R is a period ('.') and you appear to be importing European values where the decimal character is a comma (','). Thus, take note of the 'dec' argument in read.table/read.csv and modify that to dec = "," in your function call.

The NA values are the result of converting character values that cannot be coerced to numeric due to the commas:

> as.numeric("100,2")
[1] NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 

> as.numeric("100.2")
[1] 100.2

Marc Schwartz

Thanks Duncan,
This type.convert works fine for me and gives me TSTMean with decimal, but I want to add this result as a new column to my df as int or num, how can I do this?
 
Thanks,

Subject: [R] anonymizing subject identifiers for survival analysis
Message-ID: <CAM+rpY=HgsQwPsfP9bXfK=0QGe_Lfi87PYNHv27BSwVoRA56ow@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to conduct a survival analysis, examining a subject's
time to *next* appearance in a database, after their first appearance.
It is a database of dated events.

I need to obfuscate or anonymize or mask the subject identifiers (a
combination of name and birthdate). And obviously any given subject
should have the same anonymous code ever time he/she appears in the
database.  I'm not talking "safe from the NSA" here. And I won't be
releasing it. It's just sensitive data and I don't want to be working
every day with cleartext versions of it.

I've looked at packages digest, anonymizer, and anonymize.  What do
you think of this approach:

# running R 3.1.1 on Windows 7 Enterprise
library(digest)
dd <- data.frame(id=1:6, name = c("Harry", "Ron", "Hermione", "Luna",
"Ginny", "Harry"), dob = c("1990-01-01", "1990-06-15", "1990-04-08",
"1999-11-26", "1990-07-21", "1990-01-01"))
dd.2 <- transform(dd, code=paste0(tolower(name), tolower(dob), sep=""))
library(digest)
anonymize <- function(x, algo="sha256"){
  unq_hashes <- vapply(x, function(object) digest(object, algo=algo),
FUN.VALUE="", USE.NAMES=TRUE)
  unname(unq_hashes[x])
}
dd.2$codex <- anonymize(dd.2$code)
dd.2
table(duplicated(dd.2$codex))

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1274186074.11911782.1463140539471.JavaMail.zimbra@arpa.veneto.it>

hi 

I need to apply a user defined formula over some selected columns of a dataframe by subsetting group of rows (blocks) and get back a new dataframe 

I?ve been managed to get the the calculations right but I?m not satisfied at all by the form of the results 

please refer to my reproducible example 

########## 
# my user function (an example) 
mynorm <- function(x) {(x - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))/(max(x, na.rm=TRUE) - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))} 

# my dataframe to apply the formula by blocks 
mydf<-data.frame(blocks=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=5), v1=round(runif(15,10,25),0), v2=round(rnorm(15,30,5),0)) 


#my attempts (not satisfied by final output) 

tapply(mydf$v1, mydf$blocks, mynorm) 

byf<-factor(mydf$blocks) 
aggregate(mydf[2:3], list(byf), mynorm) 
aggregate(mydf[2:3], list(mydf$blocks), mynorm, simplify = FALSE) 

########### 

please can anyone give me some hints on how to properly proceed? 

I need a dataframe with all variables as final result 
sorry but I?m sort of definitely stuck with this? 

thanks

Message-ID: <BL2PR17MB0724E3B8ABADA0FDA97E20E6BD740@BL2PR17MB0724.namprd17.prod.outlook.com>

I am trying to add an equation with ?? from R to an Excel workbook.  However, I have found that the Function ?setCellFormula? doesn?t take the ?? well while a ?? in Excel equation stands for a blank cell.  I have tried NA(), EMPTY(), etc, and none of them are what I want.  Does anyone have other ways to put an equation with ?? from R to Excel workbook?  Thanks in advance.

Following is simple codes just for the demonstration, and the error is highlighted in red.

#load package "XLConnect" to add functions from R to Excel
library(XLConnect)

# Load workbook (create if not existing)
wb <- loadWorkbook("try adding an equation.xlsx", create = TRUE)

# Create a sheet named 'data'
createSheet(wb, name = 'data')

#the formula contains no double quotes which works well
formula.without.double.quote <- "IF(A2>95, 1, 0)"
setCellFormula(wb, 'data', 2, 10, formula=formula.without.double.quote)

#the formula contains double quotes which doesn?t work with the function ?setCellFormula?
formula.with.double.quote <- paste("IF(A2=", dQuote(""), ",", dQuote(""), ",1)", sep="")
setCellFormula(wb, 'data', 3, 10, formula=formula.with.double.quote)
Error: FormulaParseException (Java): Parse error near char 6 '???' in specified formula 'IF(A2=??????,??????,1)'. Expected cell ref or constant literal

#save the workbook
saveWorkbook(wb, file="C:\\Users\\try adding an equation.xlsx")

This doesn't answer your actual question, but isn't it better practice
to use ISBLANK instead of ""?

As for your actual question, a check of the parts of your command at
the R prompt would probably reveal something interesting:

> paste("IF(A2=", dQuote(""), ",", dQuote(""), ",1)", sep="")
[1] "IF(A2=??,??,1)"
> options(useFancyQuotes=FALSE)
> paste("IF(A2=", dQuote(""), ",", dQuote(""), ",1)", sep="")
[1] "IF(A2=\"\",\"\",1)"

This bit of your output should have been a hint:
IF(A2=????? ,????? ,1)

Subject: [R] apply formula over columns by subset of rows in a dataframe (to get a new dataframe)

hi 

I need to apply a user defined formula over some selected columns of a dataframe by subsetting group of rows (blocks) and get back a new dataframe 

I?ve been managed to get the the calculations right but I?m not satisfied at all by the form of the results 

please refer to my reproducible example 

########## 
# my user function (an example) 
mynorm <- function(x) {(x - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))/(max(x, na.rm=TRUE) - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))} 

# my dataframe to apply the formula by blocks 
mydf<-data.frame(blocks=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=5), v1=round(runif(15,10,25),0), v2=round(rnorm(15,30,5),0)) 


#my attempts (not satisfied by final output) 

tapply(mydf$v1, mydf$blocks, mynorm) 

byf<-factor(mydf$blocks) 
aggregate(mydf[2:3], list(byf), mynorm) 
aggregate(mydf[2:3], list(mydf$blocks), mynorm, simplify = FALSE) 

########### 

please can anyone give me some hints on how to properly proceed? 

I need a dataframe with all variables as final result 
sorry but I?m sort of definitely stuck with this? 

thanks

If you want to stay with vertical bars, the barp() function in package plotrix lets you stagger or rotate the labels:

> set.seed(42)
> Name=c("One","Two", "Three","Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", 
+      "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen", 
+      "Fourteen", "Fifteen")
> Count=sample.int(15, 15, replace=TRUE)
> z <- data.frame(Name, Count)
> with(z, barp(Count, names=Name))   # Some labels suppressed by the plot device
# Note that if you drag the plot window to be wider, the labels will eventually appear
> with(z, barp(Count, names=Name, staxx=TRUE))  # Stagger the labels
> with(z, barp(Count, names=Name, staxx=TRUE, srt=60))  # Slant the labels

Thank you very much.  The following codes you sent to me work perfectly.  "IF(A2=\"\",\"\",1)" in R becomes "IF(A2="","",1)" in Excel.  Wonderful!

This doesn't answer your actual question, but isn't it better practice to use ISBLANK instead of ""?

As for your actual question, a check of the parts of your command at the R prompt would probably reveal something interesting:

Hello Sarah
thanks a lot for your advice.

I followed your suggestions unitl the creation of "result"

The allocation of the values of result$distance to the matrix result.m,
however ,does not seem to work: it produces a matrix with identical columns
corresponding to the last values of result$distance. Maybe my description
of the dataset was not clear enough.

I produced the final matrix with a loop, that I report below (it takes
about 1 hour on my macbook pro),

set_i = -1   # create a variable to store the i values already examined

for(i in unique(result$id)){

  set_i=c(set_i,i) # store the value of the i

  set_neigh = result$id_neigh[result$id==i & !result$id_neigh %in% set_i] #
identify the locations connected to i. Exclude                  those

  for(j in set_neigh){
    if(i!=j){
      spat_dist[i,j] = result$distance[result$id==i &  result$id_neigh==j]
      spat_dist[j,i] = spat_dist[i,j]
    }
    else{
      spat_dist[i,j]=0
    }
  }
}

It not the most elegant and efficient solution in the world, that's for sure

You can also use match(code, unique(code)), as in
  transform(dd.2, codex2 = paste0("Person", match(code, unique(code))))
It is not guaranteed that x!=y implies digest(x)!=digest(y), but it is
extremely
unlikely to fail.  This match idiom guarantees that.

Sorry, you're right.

The result line should be:

result.m[cbind(factor(result$fcell), factor(result$cellneigh))]  <-
result$distance


idcell <- data.frame(
  id = seq_len(5),
  fcell = sample(1:100, 5))

censDist <- expand.grid(fcell=seq_len(100), cellneigh=seq_len(100))
censDist$distance <- runif(nrow(censDist))

# assemble the non-symmetric distance matrix
result <- subset(censDist, fcell %in% idcell$fcell & cellneigh %in%
idcell$fcell)
result.m <- matrix(NA, nrow=nrow(idcell), ncol=nrow(idcell))
result.m[cbind(factor(result$fcell), factor(result$cellneigh))]  <-
result$distance

It's just about instantaneous on the dataset you sent me:


system.time({
result <- subset(censDist, f_cell %in% id_cell$f_cell & f_cell_neigh %in%
id_cell$f_cell)
result.m <- matrix(NA, nrow=nrow(id_cell), ncol=nrow(id_cell))
result.m[cbind(factor(result$f_cell), factor(result$f_cell_neigh))] <-
result$distance
})

  user  system elapsed
  0.361   0.007   0.368

*PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS EMAIL, IT WAS SENT BY MISTAKE*

Hello Sarah
thanks a lot for your advice.

I followed your suggestions unitil the creation of "result"

The allocation of the values of result$distance to the matrix result.m,
however ,does not seem to work: it produces a matrix with identical columns
corresponding to the last values of result$distance. Maybe my description
of the dataset was not clear enough.

I produced the final matrix spat_dist with a loop, that I report below (it
takes about 1 hour on my macbook pro),

set_i = -1   # create a variable to store the i values already examined

for(i in unique(result$id)){

  set_i=c(set_i,i) # store the value of the i

  set_neigh = result$id_neigh[result$id==i & !result$id_neigh %in% set_i] #
identify the locations connected to i. If the distance between i and j was
examined before, don't look for the distance between j and i

  for(j in set_neigh){
    if(i!=j){
      spat_dist[i,j] = result$distance[result$id==i &  result$id_neigh==j]
      spat_dist[j,i] = spat_dist[i,j]
    }
    else{
      spat_dist[i,j]=0
    }
  }
}

It is not the most elegant and efficient solution in the world, that's for
sure.

I would be grateful, if you could suggest an alternative instruction to:

result.m[factor(result$fcell), factor(result$cellneigh)] <- result$distance

so I will learn a faster procedure (I tried many times but to modify this
structure but I did not make it). I don't want to abuse of your time, so
forget it if you are busy

Thank you so much anyway,
Mario

ps I attach the data. Notice that the 1327 units in id_cell are firms,
indexed by id, located in location f_cell. Different firms can be located
in the same f_cell. With respect to your suggestion, I added two columns to
"result" with the id of the firms.

yes, thanks

you pointed me in the right direction: split/unplist was the trick 

I completely left behind that possibility!

here the final version

############

mynorm <- function(x) {(x - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))/(max(x, na.rm=TRUE) - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))} 

mydf<-data.frame(blocks=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=5), v1=round(runif(15,10,25),0), v2=round(rnorm(15,30,5),0)) 

g <- mydf$blocks
l <- split(mydf, g)
l <- lapply(l, transform, v1.mod = mynorm(v1))
mydf_new <- unsplit(l, g)

############

thanks again

ave() encapsulates the split/lapply/unsplit stuff so
   transform(mydf, v1.mod = ave(v1, blocks, FUN=mynorm))
also gives what you got above.

Hi,

I?m maintainer of the R package in Alpine Linux.

I read on multiple places that some packages needs R_HOME variable set to the location where is R installed, so I?ve added it to the system-wide profile. Is this correct, or a misinformation?

What system dependencies does R need to compile modules from CRAN? On Alpine the following dependencies are needed to build R: bzip2-dev curl-dev gfortran lapack-dev pcre-dev perl readline-dev xz-dev zlib-dev. Are all of these dependencies needed for compiling modules?

Hi Jakub,

This is really a separate question. It is not really end-user related, 
and should be asked on the R-devel mailing list. Nonetheless, some 
answers below.

R_HOME is set when R starts

~$ env|grep R_HOME
~$ R --vanilla -e "Sys.getenv('R_HOME')"
 > Sys.getenv('R_HOME')
[1] "/home/mtmorgan/bin/R-3-3-branch"

and (after reading the documentation in ?R_HOME it the R help system)

~$ R RHOME
/home/mtmorgan/bin/R-3-3-branch

so there is no need to set it in a system-wide profile. It is sometimes 
referenced inside an R package source tree that uses C or other compiled 
code in a Makevars file, as described in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html
e.g., the section on configure and cleanup

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup

In these circumstances it has been set by the R process that is 
compiling the source code.

As you say, those look like dependencies required to build R itself.

Individual packages may have dependencies on these or other system 
libraries, but many packages do not have system dependencies. It is up 
to the package maintainer to ensure that appropriate checks are made to 
discover the system resource; there are probably dozens or even hundreds 
of system dependencies amongst all of the CRAN packages. Typically the 
task of satisfying those dependencies is left to the user (or to those 
creating distributions of R packages, e.g., 
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/)

- yes that's right, s(x1,x2) gives an isotropic smooth, which is usually 
only appropriate if x1 and x2 are naturally on the same scale.

predict returns s(x1)*x1 (plot.gam just plots s(x1), because in general 
s(x1,by=x2) is not smooth). If you want to get s(x1) on its own you need 
to do something like this:

x2 <- x1 ## copy x1
m <- gam(y~s(x1,by=x2)) ## model implementing s(x1,by=x1) using copy of x1
predict(m,data.frame(x1=x1,x2=rep(1,length(x2))),type="terms") ## now 
predicted s(x1)*x2 = s(x1)

best,
Simon

>From NEWS: The data frame and formula methods for aggregate() gain a drop argument.

Here, I highlight behavior of 'aggregate.data.frame' with drop=FALSE in R 3.3.0.

Example 1, modified from "example with character variables and NAs" in "Example" in R help on 'aggregate':
> testDF <- data.frame(v1 = c(1,3,5,7,8,3,5,NA,4,5,7,9),
+                      v2 = c(11,33,55,77,88,33,55,NA,44,55,77,99) )
> by1 <- c("red", "blue", 1, 2, NA, "big", 1, 2, "red", 1, NA, 12)
> by2 <- c("wet", "dry", 99, 95, NA, "damp", 95, 99, "red", 99, NA, NA)
> str(aggregate(x = testDF, by = list(by1, by2), FUN = "mean", drop = FALSE))
'data.frame':   30 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ Group.1: Factor w/ 5 levels "1","2","big",..: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 ...
 $ Group.2: Factor w/ 6 levels "95","99","damp",..: 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ v1     : num  5 7 NaN NaN NaN 5 NA NaN NaN NaN ...
 $ v2     : num  55 77 NaN NaN NaN 55 NA NaN NaN NaN ...
 - attr(*, "out.attrs")=List of 2
  ..$ dim     : Named int  5 6
  .. ..- attr(*, "names")= chr  "Group.1" "Group.2"
  ..$ dimnames:List of 2
  .. ..$ Group.1: chr  "Group.1=1" "Group.1=2" "Group.1=big" "Group.1=blue" ...
  .. ..$ Group.2: chr  "Group.2=95" "Group.2=99" "Group.2=damp" "Group.2=dry" ..
.
> str(aggregate(x = testDF, by = list(by1, by2), FUN = "mean"))
'data.frame':   8 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ Group.1: chr  "1" "2" "1" "2" ...
 $ Group.2: chr  "95" "95" "99" "99" ...
 $ v1     : num  5 7 5 NA 3 3 4 1
 $ v2     : num  55 77 55 NA 33 33 44 11

The result of 'aggregate.data.frame' with drop=FALSE has attribute "out.attrs"; the result of default 'aggregate.data.frame' (drop=TRUE) doesn't.
Character grouping variable becomes a factor in the result of 'aggregate.data.frame' with drop=FALSE; stays as character in the result of default 'aggregate.data.frame' (drop=TRUE).

Unlike 'tapply', in 'aggregate.data.frame' with drop=FALSE, the function (mean in example 2 above) is also applied to subset corresponding to combination of grouping variables that doesn't appear in the data.

Example 3, modified from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22523131/dplyr-summarise-equivalent-of-drop-false-to-keep-groups-with-zero-length-in :
> DF <- data.frame(a=rep(1:3,4), b=factor(rep(1:2,6), levels=1:3))
> aggregate(DF["a"], DF["b"], length, drop=FALSE)
  b a
1 1 6
2 2 6

Unlike 'interaction' with drop=FALSE, or 'tapply', for factor grouping variable, levels that never appear in the data (in example 3 above, "3" in 'b') don't appear in the result of 'aggregate.data.frame' with drop=FALSE.

Dear All,

Greetings. I hope you will be able to provide kind help with the following:

I am facing a strange problem ever since I have started working with R
3.3.0.

I download and work with it, it was fine. Then when I shut down and reopen,
it is not working properly.

I am getting following message:

I have uninstall it three times and reinstall -- Every time after first
installation it is working perfectly.

Then when I am closing R window and reopening it, the problem starts.

Kindly suggest what should I do. Looking forward to hear from you,

Hi

Ive got stuck using the code below to try to plot trajectories - columns are data recorded at time points, rows are cases. Ive used melt to turn the data long allowing me to group by time point and then plot using geom_point but I now need to join the points based upon the correct case (i.e. the first row in the original dataset). geo_segment allows me to specify start-end but I need to do this over multiple time periods....

Any help much appreciated

thanks

thank you, what a nice compact solution with ave() 

I learned something new about the subtleties of R 

let me here summarize the alternative solutions, just in case someonelse might be interested... 

thanks, bye 

# 

# my user function (an example) 
mynorm <- function(x) {(x - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))/(max(x, na.rm=TRUE) - min(x, na.rm=TRUE))} 

# my dataframe to apply the formula by blocks 
mydf<-data.frame(blocks=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=5), v1=round(runif(15,10,25),0), v2=round(rnorm(15,30,5),0)) 

# blocks (factors) to be used for splitting 
b <- mydf$blocks 

# 1 - split-lapply-unsplit with anonimous function to return a new df 
s <- split(mydf, b) 
l<- lapply(s, function(x) data.frame(x, v1mod=mynorm(x$v1))) 
mydf_new <- unsplit(l, mydf$blocks) 

# 2 - split-lapply-unsplit with function trasnform to return a new df 
l <- split(mydf, b) 
l <- lapply(l, transform, v1.mod = mynorm(v1)) 
mydf_new <- unsplit(l, b) 

# 3 - ave() encapsulating split-lapply-unsplit approach 
mydf_new<-transform(mydf, v1.mod = ave(v1, blocks, FUN=mynorm)) 

#

Oggetto: Re: [R] apply formula over columns by subset of rows in a dataframe (to get a new dataframe) 

ave() encapsulates the split/lapply/unsplit stuff so 
transform(mydf, v1.mod = ave(v1, blocks, FUN=mynorm)) 
also gives what you got above.

you pointed me in the right direction: split/unplist was the trick

You can introduce the row number as a  case number, you can group by case
and plot the connecting lines

#Read raw data
df = read.table("http://www.lecturematerials.co.uk/data/sample.csv",
header=TRUE, sep=",", dec=".", na.strings=c("NA"))
names(df)<-c("1","2","3","4")
df$case <- rownames(df)

#Turn data from wide to long
ds<-melt(df, id.vars = "case")

ggplot(ds, aes(x = variable, y = value, group = case)) +
  geom_point () + geom_line()

Hope this helps,
Ulrik

R 3.2.4
OS X and Windows

Colleagues,

I distribute some code to co-workers and I am trying to simplify their task.  The issue is as follows:

1.  The code automates an extensive set of processes.  Many of the steps are standardized.  However, some of the steps may require that users write snippets of code, stored in R scripts.

2.  If users write their own code, it might appear in files named UserCode1.R, UserCode2.R, etc..  The master code checks for the existence of this code, then executes
	source(?/path/to/UserCode1.R?)
This can occur at many different points in the master code (each time sourcing a different file).  
In addition to the command above, there are a variety of other commands testing whether the file exists and whether it contains certain commands that I don?t allow the user to execute.
In order to simplify the code, these commands are embedded in a function (which I will call MODIFYCODE for the moment).

3.  Assume that an object within the master code is named TEMP.  The user might add a column to TEMP.  Since this occurs within a function, there are two ways to get this modification back to the original environment:
	a.  within the function:	TEMP	<<- TEMP
	b.  use the return value from the function:
		TEMP	<-   MODIFYCODE()

4.  There are disadvantages to each of these:
	a.  The user needs to know that the ?<<-? command must be invoked.  If they don?t do so, the changes within the function are not available in the master environment
	b.  I don?t know what code will be written by the user, i.e., they might manipulate TEMP or they might create a new object or something else.  So, I don?t know a priori what to return.

So, my question is: is there some way to manipulate environments such that the changes within the function are AUTOMATICALLY transferred to the environment outside the function?

I think you have boxed yourself into a corner, much like someone painting 
the floor and failing to work their way toward an exit.

The whole premise that you will call "unknown code" that does "unknown 
things" that change the global environment is a maintenance disaster. Give 
up on at least one of these requirements.

Think of the "lm" function. It returns a list of related results, 
augmented with a "class" attribute so that methods like "print.lm" and 
"summary.lm" will work. The actions performed need not be reviewed in 
detail if the user knows what to do with the returned object. The "class" 
attribute is a bit of syntactic sugar, but the concept of putting your 
results into a list that the caller doesn't have to mix items in with 
their own is critical.

Using <<- has to be handled in a very controlled manner... wonton (as in 
"users will change my variables this way") use of that operator will 
inevitably lead to surprises and puzzlement later.

I also happen to think that standardizing on calling "source" inside 
functions is a big mistake... the functions defined by the user should be 
setup and handed off to your "master architecture" code as parameters or 
elements within lists that are parameters.

Thanks very much for the pointer - that was spot on. The key thing was to add

df$case <- rownames(df)

to generate the row by row case for when I melted the columns. As Ive since found out either of these will work

ggplot(ds, aes(x = as.numeric(variable), y = value, colour = case)) +
  geom_point () + geom_line()

ggplot(ds, aes(x = variable, y = value, group = case)) +
  geom_point () + geom_line()

Much appreciated!

Jeff

Thanks for your insights.  I suspected that this was the case but I was hoping for a work-around.  Regardless, I have modified the code so that the source() command is no longer in a function ? all the pre- and post-commands are now in two functions, executed before and after the source command.  Problem solved.

"... wonton (as in "users will change my variables this way") use of
that operator will inevitably lead to surprises and puzzlement later.
"

Is this related to the myriad of choices in a Chinese menu? ;-)

Message-ID: <356ef8cc-2994-9ab4-3fda-1a7157dee9c5@yahoo.com.br>

Dears,
I imagine that the LP method should be the solution to find the
parameters of one objective function ...
I known there are the constrOptim command for this.

but I don't know how to elaborate the contour condictions  in matricial
forms
that the way like constrOptim works

I show below one function example to be optimized

I appreciate much if somebody can help me
responding if I really am right imagining LP like ideal tool in my case
and indicate basic material (introduction) about the subject

below

Thanks in advanced

Hello,

I ran a 2x2x2 repeated measures ANOVA which turned out fine:

However, when I run the interactions alone (from the same dataset), I get a different set of results than what was originally shown e.g.

I also get different results when i run the interactions alone too. Curious to know why this is.

Sorry, but this is close to unreadable. Please retry, and not in HTML this time. 

However AFAICT, the only difference between the two sets of results (re. main effects present in both) is that the residual df differs, hence so does F and p-value.

You have an overactive imagination... these equations are nonlinear.

Subject: [R] clm function in ordinal package: "Hessian is numerically
	singular"
Message-ID: <CALTLwxCSpkOWJC7YNE7we6iv-6kUcAtf24v6B_H+rd+_42SnNA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm modeling ordinal data using the clm function from the ordinal package
in R. For that I have 4 variables, 2 ordinal and 2 continuous (O1, O2, C1,
C2).

O1 <- c(2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,3,3,2,1,3,2,2,2)
O2 <- c(2,2,3,2,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3,2,2,2,2)
C1 <- C(49,25,1000,19,61,700,25,375,35,46,105,437,3300,31,203,34,800)
C2 <- c(25350,25050,14925,25050,14325,16300,26425,22250,22250,44650,44650,21400,30125,25350,25050,14325,17525)
data <- data.frame (O1, O2, C1, C2)
data <- within(data, {
O1 <- factor ((O1), ordered =TRUE,
              levels = c("1", "2", "3"))
O2 <- factor ((O2), ordered =TRUE,
              levels = c("1", "2", "3"))})

In a first step I want to model O1 as response variable and O2, C1 and C2
as predictors (3 different models) and second, use O2 as response and O1,
C1 and C2 as predictors (another 3 different models).

m1 <- clm(O1 ~ O2, data = data)
m2 <- clm(O1 ~ C1, data = data)
m3 <- clm(O1 ~ log(C2), data = data)
m4 <- clm(O2 ~ O1, data = data)
m5 <- clm(O2 ~ C1, data = data)
m6 <- clm(O2 ~ log(C2), data = data)

As you can see all models run without problem except for the first one (m1)
which gives as a warning message:

(1) Hessian is numerically singular: parameters are not uniquely determined
In addition: Absolute convergence criterion was met, but relative criterion
was not met

and do not report any standard error or wald z test.

I do not have this problem when simulating data

 data$x1 <- sample(c(1,2,3), 17, replace = TRUE)

What confuses me is that, unlike with m1 (O1 ~ O2), the model which uses O2
as response and O1 as predictor works perfectly fine. In addition I have
tried replacing some values in O1 and it happened that when substituting 1
by 2 or 3 I do not get any warning message and I obtain all the
coefficients of the model.

I made some research and it seems and this can be due to low representation
of certain values in the response, as well as to a small sample size. Is
that right or can it be a bug? Can someone help me please?

Thanks a lot!
Carlos Bautista

Dear Carlos

I think the issue is that you have some zeroes.

 > table(O1, O2)
    O2
O1   1  2  3
   1  1  0  2
   2  0 10  0
   3  2  2  0
 >

Note that when you predict O1 from O2 level 3 of O2 gives a perfect 
prediction.

When you predict O2 from O1 level 2 gives a perfect prediction but I 
think you are saved here because the order constraint means that only 
zeroes at the extreme categories are fatal.

Try experimenting with zeroes in different places, perhaps using more 
levels with artificial data and see what happens and if I am right. 
Warning, I may be wrong.

Hi all,
I have a column in my df and I want to get quartiles for this column and then calculate mean for each and every quartile, here is my column:


    df$BR 
    [1] 384 384 384 384 512 384 384 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 384 
    [19] 384 384 320 320 320 320 384 384 256 320 320 320 384 320 320 320 384 384 
    [37] 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 384 320 320 320 320 320 320 384 320 
    [55] 320 320 320 320 320 320 384 512 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 384 384 320 
    [73] 320 320 384 320 320 320 320 256 320 320 384 320 384 320 384 320 320 320 
    [91] 384 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 

I do the following to get the quartiles:

    
    quantile(m$BR) 
    0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
    256  320  320  368  512

now how can I get mean for each quartile?
Thnaks for any help,
Elahe

The quartiles are strictly speaking the boundaries but if you really 
meant that the problem is trivial so i assume you want to cut the 
variable at the quartiles.

How about setting up a vector which takes the values 1, 2, 3, 4 
depending on the values of BR with cutpoints defined by 
quantile(BR)(using ifelse) and then using tapply?

Hi Elahe,

you can create a matrix of ranges and loop over each row:

m <- c(384, 384, 384, 384, 512, 384, 384, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320,
320, 320, 320, 320, 384,
384, 384, 320, 320, 320, 320, 384, 384, 256, 320, 320, 320, 384, 320, 320,
320, 384, 384,
320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 384, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320,
320, 384, 320,
320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 384, 512, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320,
384, 384, 320,
320, 320, 384, 320, 320, 320, 320, 256, 320, 320, 384, 320, 384, 320, 384,
320, 320, 320,
384, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320, 320)

qm <- quantile(m)

q.ranges <- matrix(c(0, qm[1:(length(qm) - 1)], qm), ncol = 2)

apply(q.ranges, MARGIN = 1, function(cr){
  mean(m[m > cr[1] & m <= cr[2]])
})

Hope this helps
Ulrik

Thnaks for your reply,

By using tapply I get this result:

    
    tapply(df$BR, findInterval(df$BR, quantile(df$BR)), mean) 
    1   3   4   5 
    256 320 384 512

But I think this is not true,cause I have to get 5 means but here I get four numbers!

How about setting up a vector which takes the values 1, 2, 3, 4 
depending on the values of BR with cutpoints defined by 
quantile(BR)(using ifelse) and then using tapply?

Do you understand that quartiles divide the data into 4 groups?

Min (group 1) 1st quartile (group 2) median (group3) 3rd quartile (group4) max

But in your case df$BR has only 4 unique values:

> table(df$BR)

256 320 384 512 
  2  74  24   2

So the first quartile is equal to the median:

> quantile(df$BR)
  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
 256  320  320  368  512

You need to use the argument rightmost.closed=TRUE with findInterval(). If you do not, the 5th group consists of only those values that are equal to the maximum:

> df$quant <- findInterval(df$BR, quantile(df$BR), rightmost.closed=TRUE)
> tapply(df$BR, df$quant, mean)
       1        3        4 
256.0000 320.0000 393.8462

Using values that are more variable:

> set.seed(42)
> df <- data.frame(BR=sample.int(100, 100, replace=TRUE))
> df$quant <- findInterval(df$BR, quantile(df$BR), rightmost.closed=TRUE)
> tapply(df$BR, df$quant, mean)
    1     2     3     4 
12.48 41.24 67.24 90.64

This also came up in a google search on "STAR models R"  .

If your search fails to find hits that meet your needs, please tells

I don't know why this is happening, but the nsInfo.rds file is part of every installed package (see Section 4.1 of the R Internals documentation) and it sounds like one or more of them are getting corrupted.  This could be because you or your .Rprofile or an .RData file are triggering a bug in one of your packages. 

You might try
* posting the output of the sessionInfo function, 
* looking in your .Rprofile file with a text editor, 
* deleting/renaming any RData files in your working directory,  and perhaps
* clearing/renaming your personal 3.3 package library and re-installing one package at a time to see which one triggers the error.

Subject: [R] problem with matrix
Message-ID: <CAJMcJMD6LvxStVWwh4Kuj_gmy5rd-RBvZmXubYk6nCdw+gRjCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I've a simple question.
I have a matrix with same values over and under the diagonal. That's an
example:
  [,1] [,2]     [,3]
[1,]      NaN   45 63.43495
[2,] 45.00000  NaN 90.00000
[3,] 63.43495   90      NaN
How can I extract just the three values over (or under) the diagonal and
convert them in a  vector like this: 45, 63.43495, 90 ?

Thank's in advance

Hello,

See the help page for ?lower.tri.
If your matrix is named 'x', something like

x[upper.tri(x)]

Hope this helps,

Suggestion: When new, seek out and follow guides -- in this case, the
posting guide (below), which asks that you post your code that failed.
In this case, an obvious guess is that you have mis-specified or maybe
misspelled one or more of your modeling variables in the call, but
without the code, one can't tell.

Hi Sarah,
thanks a lot. In this line:

result.m[cbind(factor(result$f_cell), factor(result$f_cell_neigh))] <-
result$distance

I had a problem with cbind(factor .. : the assignement to the [i,j] element
of the matrix did not work.

I solved in this manner:

- I modified censDist, so for every couple of location codes (f_cell,
f_cell_neigh), I added the corresponding id from id_cell (they are directly
interpretable as the coordinates of the 1327x1327 result.m matrix). So
censDist looks like this:

head(censDist)
   f_cell f_cell_neigh  distance id id_neigh
1   2924         2732 1309.7525 NA       NA
2   2924         2875  696.2891 NA       NA
3   2924         2351 1346.0561 NA      975
4   2924         2350 1296.9804 NA      758
5   2924         2725 1278.1877 NA       NA
6   2924         2721 1346.9126 NA       NA

Then I run your code with a slight modification of the last row:

resultS <- subset(censDist, f_cell %in% id_cell$f_cell & f_cell_neigh %in%
id_cell$f_cell)
resultS.m <- matrix(NA, nrow=nrow(id_cell), ncol=nrow(id_cell))
resultS.m[cbind(resultS$id, resultS$id_neigh)] <- resultS$distance

and it worked!

thank you so much,
Mario

Subject: [R] Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTclObjv, objv),
 class = "tclObj") when selecting (HTTP mirrors) in update.packages()
Message-ID: <CAKstpn5EiMRfc722yZvrX55LmypMdaJkN2vxCoUJJZ-sdxn1Fw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

When I try to run update.packages() and double click on the last
option (HTTP mirrors), I receive the error message:
 Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTclObjv, objv), class = "tclObj")

While I can reliably reproduce the error, if I double click quickly
enough (decreased time between the two clicks) the error doesn't
appear, so it may be that the menu is receiving two clicks, very close
together instead of a double click causing it to fail.

update.packages()
--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---
Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTclObjv, objv), class = "tclObj") :

Additional information:
If I run update.packages() in the same R session after receiving the
above error, in addition to the normal menu with title "HTTPS CRAN
mirror", a smaller, empty menu appears with the title "HTTP CRAN
mirror".

Thanks.

Dear R User,

I have a data with a mean and Standard Error (SE) but no sample size, I am wondering whether I can compute the standard deviation (SD) with these information. if possible, how much would be for the given example?

Hi Kristi,
Multiply the standard error by the square root of the sample size.

Message-ID: <DB5PR07MB11097B567822D62EC2046841DB480@DB5PR07MB1109.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi All,


I'm using number of models such as lm(), tree, randomForest, svm, and nnet for predicting the delays in projects. Also, I computed the sum of  squared error for all these models for comparison purposes. However, I want to use other related evaluation criteria such as root mean sum of square error (RMSE) and R Squared for evaluation of these models.


My question is that is it possible to compute these criteria (RMSE or R2) for all above-mentioned statistical models.


Second, for the lm() we can see the co-efficient values by checking model summary. Is it possible to see the co-efficient for other models such as SVM and neural network?


Thanks in advance for the help and support.


Many Thanks and


Kind Regards

Short executive summary to all the nice explanations and
examples (by the other Martin M) below:

  Yes, this is misinformation.
  You should *NOT* set R_HOME in a (system wide /  user) profile.

Dear R help subscribers,




I am working on a word cloud where in I want the words to appear in the same order as in the sentence/text. 

I only know&nbsp;the random.order -&nbsp;which plots words in random order. If false, they will be plotted in decreasing frequency.

&nbsp;

Any help is most welcome.

&nbsp;

Regards

Shailaja

Dear Kristi

You will doubtless soon receive a reply telling you this is a 
statistical question and off-topic here but in the meantime, do you have 
any other information like a value of a test statistic or a p-value? 
Sometimes they can be used.

And please set your mailer to send plain text not HTML as it scrambles 
messages.

A) I am not a Dr. I am just someone who has been using R for awhile. Since the install process usually works for me, I might not even be the best person to identify your problem, but I will help if I can. 

B) sessionInfo is a function.  You have to invoke functions by including argument parentheses,  like so:

sessionInfo()

Looking at how that function is implemented when you ask the interpreter to print the function definition doesn't help us differentiate your setup from anyone else's.

C) you have not addressed the question of what might be in your .Rprofile. That is a file by that name in your home directory (My Documents?) If it does not exist, it can't be a problem, but you need to confirm. 

D) You have not addressed what might be corrupted in your personal package library (typically My Documents\R\win-lib\3.3). Confirm that you have renamed or deleted it. 

E) It might be relevant to ask how you are installing the package. What was the exact URL of the installation file?  Did you make the mistake of using the "Run As Administrator" option when you started that install file? (If so,  that can make it quite difficult to clean up bad file permissions. I am not even sure how to fix that, so you would need someone else to help if so.)

F) What commands are you giving to R during your first run?

Here are two ways that do not use any packages:

Dear Dr. Jeff,

Many thanks for your reply. Here is the output of session info.

I uninstalled all versions of R from my PC and stored R files, then
reinstall.

First time, it works smoothly. But crashing once I shut down and reopen...

Details appended below...

Thanks and hope you will be able to help and support ...

Best regards,

If the documentation for those models does not tell you how, then you should ask yourself whether what you are trying to do makes sense statistically. The question of what makes sense statistically is not a good fit for this forum, which is about R.

By the way, root mean square errors are easy to calculate... the hard part is knowing whether doing so is informative per above.

Hello,

does anyone know when the R 3.3 binary for RH Linux 7 will be available from the RedHat Repository?

One of my R scripts, which uses ggplot2, works fine in RStudio 3.24 on Windows, but doesn't display any graphics in RStudio Server 3.23 on Linux RH 7.

I would like to upgrade the server's R version, but only R v. 3.23 is available from the RH Repository.

Many thanks.

Phiroc

If I am not mistaken, R is not available from the RH repo. It is available from Fedora's EPEL repo for RH, CentOS and the like. I use Fedora and I have noticed that 3.3 is in testing repo there. You may want to install it and provide feedback on bodhi if you want a faster move to EPEL (and Fedora) repos.

Hi,

First, RHEL and related distributions (e.g. Fedora), have a dedicated R-SIG list:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-fedora

Future queries in this domain should be submitted there, as many of the RH package maintainers (e.g. Tom Callaway, aka Spot) read that list.

Second, as you may be already aware, R is available via the EPEL, not the regular RH repos:

  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

Third, you can check the current status of RH related R builds in two places:

Bodhi, which is the RPM distribution framework - https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=R

Koji, which is the build framework - http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=1230


It would appear that Tom is in the process of preparing a 3.3.0 release, but I would defer to him on the time frame for release, which generally requires that testers provide the requisite feedback to increase the "karma" to a pre-specified level.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Message-ID: <CADw4Cksj-v_Kmo4T2_TU58pmUSm4HT0JjpnM2vDdw5F2qYRDdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Wishing you all well.

I am exploring text mining with R. Here is where I need help:

1. The starting point is a data frame

worder1<- c("I am, taking 2","are these the three samples?",
            "He speaks differently to you, aint it !","This is distilled -
my dear, now give me $3","I saved 2500 this month.")
df1 <- data.frame(id=1:5, words=worder1)

here in dput format:

dput(df1)
structure(list(id = 1:5, words = structure(c(3L, 1L, 2L, 5L,
4L), .Label = c("are these the three samples?", "He speaks differently to
you, aint it !",
"I am, taking 2", "I saved 2500 this month.", "This is distilled - my dear,
now give me $3"
), class = "factor")), .Names = c("id", "words"), row.names = c(NA,
-5L), class = "data.frame")


2. The corpus rituals ...

corp1 <- Corpus(VectorSource(df1$words))
inspect(corp1)
class(corp1)

corp1 <- tm_map(corp1, removeNumbers)
corp1 <- tm_map(corp1, removePunctuation)
corp1 <- tm_map(corp1, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
corp1 <- tm_map(corp1, stripWhitespace)
class(corp1)


3. Getting to the analysis

tdm1 <- TermDocumentMatrix(corp1)
inspect(tdm1[1:5,])
dtm1 <- DocumentTermMatrix(corp1)
inspect(dtm1[1:5,])

4. Now here is the problem

If I do a translation, not in getTransformations(), I am unable to convert
to tdm or dtm

corp1 <- tm_map(corp1, tolower)
class(corp1)
tdm1.2 <- TermDocumentMatrix(corp1)
dtm1.2 <- DocumentTermMatrix(corp1)

The error returned is:

Error: inherits(doc, "TextDocument") is not TRUE

5. The explaination on internet suggests either

a) corp1 <- tm_map(corp1, content_transformer(tolower))
which in my case returns error:
Error in UseMethod("content", x) :
  no applicable method for 'content' applied to an object of class
"character"

b) corpus_clean <- tm_map(corp1, PlainTextDocument)
which results in loss of all the meta data

I will appreciate any help. Lastly to keep the doc ids with R corpus,
should the step 2 be changed as:
corp1 <- Corpus(DataframeSource(df1))

from:
corp1 <- Corpus(VectorSource(df1$words))

Thanks /

Subject: [R] projectRaster function no values
Message-ID: <CAOV3wDDD+AxXxFqqnKPUnoNte400u-W2LJhoTSpA30oFL4iizg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Greetings! Any help with this problem is appreciated!

I'm working to get a netcdf file that has a Lambert Conformal Conic
projection into geographic, but also a smaller area.  Here's the issue I'm
having - essentially it looks like projectRaster is working, but the
resulting raster has no values.

The data itself is massive so I can't include that, but here's what's going
on.


> testvar2 = raster("SE/test.nc",band=t,varname="TAMAX") # pulling first
time slice of my netcdf

I'm quite perplexed with this one, I feel like I'm doing everything right
so I'm not sure what's failing.  The R version is R 3.2.3 in a Linux/Unix
environment.

Many thanks for your help!

I want to know if the wigglyness of the smooths [s(ctrial, by=igc)] is

k-index and p-value are NAs:

Basis dimension (k) checking results. Low p-value (k-index<1) may

s(ctrial,sbj)           64.00 43.04      NA      NA

Does anyone know why is this?

Thank you in advance for your time,
Fotis

P.S. I am using RStudio Version 0.99.896, R 3.3.0, and mgcv package version

Subject: [R] Placement of words in a word cloud as per its occurance.

Hi Shailaja,
If you just want a line of words, it's not too difficult if you have
the word frequencies:

# take a common sentence
sentence<-"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words<-unlist(strsplit(sentence," "))
# make up some word frequencies
wordfreq<-c(10,1,2,2,3,4,10,6,5)
library(plotrix)
# scale the frequencies into a convenient range
wordcex<-rescale(wordfreq,c(0.5,2))
x11(height=4)
# a simple function to display a vector of words in different sizes
wordline<-function(words,wordcex,space=0.005) {
 plotxy<-par("usr")
 x<-plotxy[1]
 y<-sum(plotxy[3:4])/2
 space<-diff(plotxy[1:2])*space
 for(i in 1:length(words)) {
  par(cex=wordcex[i])
  text(x,y,words[i],adj=0)
  x<-x+strwidth(words[i])+space
 }
}
# get an empty plot
plot(1:10,type="n",axes=FALSE,xlab="",ylab="")
# display the words
wordline(words,wordcex)

The function can be elaborated to fit the sentence into the available
space, break it into lines, all that sort of thing.

Jim

Message-ID: <CAMLwc7PpRMsNJLChxw3RjnS-vgo4ZX+1YkCFD_8emWU8N=eaTg@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to convert latitude and longitude into addresses in R using
Wikimapia mapping instead of Google? The reason being that Wikimapia
addresses have more details.

This is the code I have been using but this obtains the information from
Google.

library(data.table)
library(ggmap)

coords<- structure(list(Lattitude = c(23.8642394, 23.8643628, 23.8645843,
23.8632958, 23.8632859), Longitude = c(90.3981852, 90.3981042,
90.3954784, 90.3940043, 90.3940025)), .Names = c("Lattitude",
"Longitude"), row.names = c(NA, 5L), class = "data.frame")

coords$textAddress <- mapply(FUN = function(lon, lat) revgeocode(c(lon,
lat)), coords$Longitude, coords$Lattitude)

Thank you!

Sincerely,

Milu

A few points of order; you seem to be making a couple of rookie mistakes here. (Don't take it personally, lots of people do).

1) Posting in HTML comes across garbled (and it can get much worse than what you see below), so please configure you mail program to avoid doing that.

2) You seem to assume that we all immediately recognize the task you are working on and that there is a well-known and generally accepted methodology for which we just need to supply some detail that you have overlooked. In fact, the majority will be doing things in hundreds of different directions, and even those who are into wordclouds may be taking different approaches to it, there could be implementations in several packages, etc. Some people might be mildly interested in helping out (perhaps they want to make a wordcloud for themselves one day), but they would need to know what code you are using. As it stands, people are left wondering which function it might be that has an argument called random.order.

Dear Fotis,

The test is a randomization test, based on comparing differences of 
residuals, ordered with respect to the covariate of the smooth, to 
differences of residuals in randomized order. Random effect terms are 
excluded because there is not basis size to choose. Currently smooths 
with factor by variables are also excluded for reasons of maintainer 
laziness, as this would require special case code to exclude the 
covariate values that are irrelevant given the factor level. Sorry about 
that.

My guess is that you don't have a problem here anyway, given the fairly 
low edfs relative to the basis dimension. In general as a double check I 
would plot the residuals against ctrial, colour coded by level of igc, 
just to check that there doesn't seem to be missed pattern in them. 
However with binary residuals you are unlikely to see much.

best,
Simon

Hello,

I have written an R script which displays a bar chart using the ggplot2 library (please refer
to code excerpt at the bottom of this e-mail).

Although the bar chart is displayed OK in the Windows version of RStudio (v. 3.2.4),
nothing appears on Linux RH 7 in Rstudio Server 3.2.3.

I have tried replacing the data frame in the RH-version of the script by 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a <- c("ab", "bc", "cd")
b <- c(1, 2, 3)
ds <- data.frame(a,b)
g1 <- ggplot(data = ds, aes(x = a))


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

... but to avail: ggplot doesn't plot anything. No error message are displayed.

Any help with this issue would be much appreciated.

Many thanks.

phiroc

g1 <- ggplot(data = mergedD, aes(x=DESC_TYPE))

Hi Jim,




Thank you for the reply.




Is there a way out to use it with wordcloud package and built a comparative and commonality cloud. 




My usage: 




comparison.cloud(term.matrix,max.words=300)&nbsp;&nbsp; commonality.cloud(term.matrix,random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0)




I am already&nbsp;doing a lot of preprocessing and the sentence is not limited to 1 or 2.




Thanks,

Context is everything.  Please follow the Posting Guide and provide a minimal reproducible example. Also,  if your scripts are literally the same on the two platforms, you should provide the output of the sessionInfo() function for each.

Hi Adrienne,

You'll always get great help for these kinds of questions if you subscribe and post to the R-SIG-Geo mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo  I highly recommend that you join!

I have encountered this before, and usually it is because I have mistakenly assumed that source and destination data are roughly coincident.  I'm not sure if that is true in your case. I have tried to replicate your steps.  I transformed the coordinates of your source and destination rasters into SpatialPoints objects, and then I reprojected your source coordinates to the projection of your destination coordinates.  Unless I have messed up a step, you can see in the plot generated that there is a significant difference in the extent of the source and destination rasters.  Perhaps your destination coordinates are amiss?

Cheers,
Ben

Subject: [R] Vectorised operations
Message-ID: <57342100db38c7a9ac572036b30008d8.squirrel@quantex.zedcore.com>

Folks

I have some very long vectors - typically 1 million long - which are
indexed by another vector, same length, with values from 1 to a few
thousand, sp each sub part of the vector may be a few hundred values long.

I want to calculate the cumulative maximum of each sub part the main
vector by the index in an efficient manner.  This can obviously be done in
a loop but the whole calculation is embedded within many other
calculations which would make everything very slow indeed.  All the other
sums are vectorised already.

For example,

A=c(1,2,1,  -3,5,6,7,4,  6,3,7,6,9, ...)
i=c(1,1,1,   2,2,2,2,2,  3,3,3,3,3, ...)

where A has three levels that are not the same but the levels themselves
are all monotonic non-decreasing.

the answer to be a vector of the same length:

R=c(1,2,2,  -3,5,6,7,7,  6,6,7,7,9, ...)

If I could reset the cumulative maximum to -1e6 (eg) at each change of
index, a simple cummax would do but I can't see how to do this.

The best way I have found so far is to use the aggregate command:

as.vector(unlist(aggregate(a,list(i),cummax)[[2]]))

but rarely this fails, returning a shorter vector than expected and seems
rather ugly,  converting to and from lists which may well be an
unnecessary overhead.

I have been trying other approaches using apply() methods but either it
can't be done using them or I can't get my head round them!

Any ideas?

Best wishes

John

Ben,

Thanks so for much for the heads up on R-sig-geo (totally forgot about that
one myself).  Thank you also for the clue, it gave me a poke in the right
direction to figure it out.  I'll share with the group just in case someone
else runs across this.  It was actually something off with the resolution
and extent in the source data.

> t=1
> testvar2 = raster("SE/test.nc",band=t,varname="TAMAX") # pulling first
time slice of my netcdf
> testvar2

class       : RasterLayer
band        : 1  (of  4  bands)
dimensions  : 229, 234, 53586  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
resolution  : 15, 15  (x, y)
extent      : -1747.5, 1762.5, -1710, 1725  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
coord. ref. : +proj=lcc +lon_0=-77 +lat_0=38 +lat_1=30 +lat_2=60
+ellps=WGS84
data source : /projdata/dcerp/DSdata/regcmdata/SE/test.nc
names       : Avg.Max.Aneom.Temperature
z-value     : 1960-01-01
zvar        : TAMAX

The CRS in the file was giving the resolution as 15, but in reality this is
a 15km resolution dataset and should cover an area from 20N to 50N and
about 100W to 50W.  R was interpreting the resolution as 15m, which caused
it to have the small extent, instead of what it should have been, which is
covering Eastern North America.   I had to mess with the resolution and
extent a bit, but once I did it worked beautifully with projectRaster.

Thanks again!

Adrienne

ave(A, i, FUN=cummax) loops but is faster than your aggregate-based
solution.  E.g.,

> i <- rep(1:10000, sample(0:210, replace=TRUE, size=10000))
> length(i)
[1] 1056119
> a <- sample(-50:50, replace=TRUE, size=length(i))

as.vector(unlist(aggregate(a,list(i),cummax)[[2]])) )

Sorry, I can't help, but  wanted to note that "apply methods" are
essentially just loops and rarely much faster or slower than explicit
loops. (Those of us who use them do so for clarity and maintainability
of code reasons).

Cheers,

Hi all,
I am using R version 3.2.3 and I want to plot 3D histogram or 3D scatterplot. Does anyone know which packages can be used for this version for 3D plots? I tried plot3d but it's not working for this version.
 
Thanks for any help.

Hi John,
I may be misunderstanding what you want, but this seems to produce the
output you specify:

A<-sample(-10:100,100)
i<-rep(1:10,c(5:13,19))
# replace the last value of x with the maximum
max_last<-function(x) return(c(x[-length(x)],max(x)))
as.vector(unlist(by(A,i,max_last)))

and this is what I would expect using the cummax function:

as.vector(unlist(by(A,i,cummax)))

Jim

Couple of points:
1) this is the R-help mailing list. If there is a problem with RStudio, nice as it is it has its own support area.  If the bug can be reproduced without RStudio then this list or one of its sister lists are appropriate. 
2) I don't have RedHat, but I can try this later at home on Ubuntu. 
3) Posting in HTML causes problems. The Posting Guide warns you to post in plain text.  This may be why your request did not show up on the list, where people with red hat might have already seen it by now. 
4) There is an R-sig-Fedora mailing list that might have people with better answers for your possibly-OS-specific question than this OS-neutral mailing list. 
5) I notice that there are several differences here: OS, R version, RStudio edition, and several packages. You might try to bring these into alignment to narrow the possible sources of the trouble.

Hi there
I have been using R for a while now. I am doing my PhD project with it. Recently, it keeps crashing, mostly when I draw a graph and use XYPLOT code. I even spent some money on cleaning registry, checking ram, deleting unnecessary files from working directory. I used "plot(cars) and?dev.off(). First the">" sign disappears from the console and then if I try to remove the plot or something else, the whole R freezes. When the ">" disappears, R doesn't run the commands anymore. I searched all online questions and answers, but I couldn't fix this. Please help me. PLEASE.
Cheers

Context is everything. Please follow the Posting Guide and provide a minimal reproducible example. Also, if your scripts are literally the same on the two platforms, you should provide the output of the sessionInfo() function for each.

Hello, 

I have written an R script which displays a bar chart using the ggplot2 library (please refer 
to code excerpt at the bottom of this e-mail). 

Although the bar chart is displayed OK in the Windows version of RStudio (v. 3.2.4), 
nothing appears on Linux RH 7 in Rstudio Server 3.2.3. 

I have tried replacing the data frame in the RH-version of the script by 




a <- c("ab", "bc", "cd") 
b <- c(1, 2, 3) 
ds <- data.frame(a,b) 
g1 <- ggplot(data = ds, aes(x = a)) 





... but to avail: ggplot doesn't plot anything. No error message are displayed. 

Any help with this issue would be much appreciated. 

Many thanks.

2: In install.packages("GARPFRM", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org") :  installation of package ?GARPFRM? had non-zero exit status


(b) library(GARPFRM)

It gives following error :  Error in library(GARPFRM) : there is no package called ?GARPFRM?

Please help me in this regard.

Thanks

One thing for sure: It's not the fault of R nor Rstudio (because they are
doing fine on other people's computers, mine included). You can probably
get some help on the Rstudio support forum.

.tar.gz packages are source packages. The default for the install.packages function is for binary packages. (Generally you will not find binary packages on R-Forge.)

You should read the help pages for install.packages.

Trying to load a package which failed to install should not surprise you.

Perhaps you =misspelled the package name. I see no plot3d package. (But there is a plot3D package.)

For 3D scatterplot you can use also "scatterplot3d" package.

Do the crashes happen in R if you run it without RStudio?  If not, this 
is something you need to report to the RStudio people, not here.

If they do happen in plain R, try running with the --vanilla option.  If 
that is fine, the problem is probably something you have in your saved 
workspace, or in one of the startup files.

What happens if you run R in a console or the Windows GUI if you are using Windows

We need to isolate the issue as an R issue or an RStudio one or a local computer one.  My experience is that occasionally RStudio will do something a bit weird but usually rebooting RStudio  cures it.

If it appears to be an RStudio problem you will need to go to the RStudio support. 

For some general suggestions on how to ask questions here have a look at

I had this problem as well, a lot, and it was frustrating and I did not
find much reference to it online. I believe it occurs after you run a plot
and then make the plotting window too small for R studio to redraw the
plot. Then when run a line of code, it never runs or appears to be running
indefinitely. The "STOP" sign does not show up either, so you cannot stop
the process that way - I always had to force stop via control alt delete.
After I starting paying attention to either clearing all plots or keeping
the size of the window big enough to draw the plot, the problem totally
stopped. I do not know/understand what the underlying problem is, but
hopefully it is resolved in newer versions.

Also, this starting happening for me with R studio 0.99.893, so if you have
a different version, maybe it is a different issue (or maybe it is a
different issue regardless...).

Hi Saba,
Your main worry may be that of non- zero status and hence your attempt to
load what the system claims you have. I have encountered such problems
severally. You can try two things: run it several times ( network issues
might play a role) or try different crab mirrors.

Subject: [R] x-axis tick marks on log scale plot
Message-ID: <CAEQKoCHSLXiUV=jB_wrhRw9_h9ZAea_p_0Ymto8_CKCmFiHgtg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a plot with log scale on the axes. How do I add ticks and labels in
addition to the ones provided by default? Can I specify where I want the
ticks and labels?

For example:

set.seed(12345)
x <- sample(1:10000,10)
y <- sample(1:10000,10)

plot(x,y,log="xy")


For me, this plot has tick marks (and labels) at 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000.
How can I make the axes so that it has marks and labels at 1000 intervals
(i.e. 2000, 3000, 4000, etc.)

thanks!

You'll get ticks on side 1 (the x axis) by using

axis(1, at=1000*(2:10))

You'll get labels at some of those locations; R will leave some out, if 
it looks as though the labels will overlap.  Using las=2 will make them 
perpendicular to the axis, and all should be drawn.

Hi,

You can do it by first plotting your values without the x-axis:
plot(x,y,log="xy", xaxt="n")

and then plotting the x-axis with ticks where you need to:
axis(side=1, at=seq(2000,8000,1000))

HTH,
Ivan

I didn't say that there is a problem with R or Rstudio. I said, it keeps crashing for whatever reason. If it is not crashing on your computer It doesn't mean that it never might crash. This is not help after keeping me waiting for long time. Such a waste of time corresponding with you.

One thing for sure: It's not the fault of R nor Rstudio (because they are doing fine on other people's computers, mine included). You can probably get some help on the Rstudio support forum.

First the">" sign disappears from the console and then if I try to remove the plot or something else, the whole R freezes. When the ">" disappears, R doesn't run the commands anymore. I searched all online questions and answers, but I couldn't fix this. Please help me. PLEASE.

Thank you Peter for pointing out my errors.

I shall take care of if henceforth.

To keep the mail short I left out the details, sorry about that.

&nbsp;



I am using&nbsp;wordcloud package&nbsp;to built a comparative and commonality cloud. 



My usage: 



comparison.cloud(term.matrix,max.words=300)commonality.cloud(term.matrix,random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0)



I am already&nbsp;doing a lot of preprocessing and the sentence is not limited to 1 or 2.

The words in the word cloud are placed in random order if random.order=FALSE then it is placed according to its frequency.

&nbsp;

I want the same order as the sentence minus the stop words.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

Thanks,

 with RSelenium in CRAN Machines?
Message-ID: <CANMhtdz9bFR+5QaLW8sXxt6upduiayW-xn2xDrHphSkPMfBmPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys,

First time posting here.

I have a CRAN package called GetTDData that downloads and reads public data
from a government website (
http://www.tesouro.fazenda.gov.br/tesouro-direto-balanco-e-estatisticas).

Recently (today), the website has changed its structure by removing
permanent links of the files and creating a "random" html address for the
files that really matter. This means that when I download the souce html
code, I don't have the information for the actual links, but just a bunch
of code.

In the past I have dealed with this type of problem by forcing the
renderization of the page using RSelenium with firefox or PhantomJS and
then capturing the desired href locations.

My question is, if integrate my code with RSelenium using firefox or
PhantonJS, will it pass on all arquitectures (win, linux, solaris) of CRAN?

I'm happy to hear any other ideas.

Many thanks!

Hello all,

I've run a model, and now would like to extract residuals.  However, I 
have set sum-to-zero contrasts for the categorical fixed effect 
(contr.sum).  Because I am interested in looking at the variation in the 
residuals associated with that fixed effect (along with other levels), I 
need to calculate residuals setting that fixed effect to zero.  Any 
thoughts on how to do this?

thanks,
allie



contr.sum.keepnames <- function(...) {
     # make deviation contrasts that don't lose the names of the factors 
in the model results
     # from

     conS <- contr.sum(...)
     colnames(conS) = rownames(conS)[-length(rownames(conS))]
     conS
}

test_df = data.frame(site = rep(LETTERS[1:10], 10), resp = runif(100), 
pred = runif(100))

contrasts(test_df$site) = contr.sum.keepnames(levels(test_df$site))

What does Bmat contain? Perhaps try table(table(Bmat)) and see if any 
entries are greater than unity.

Hi all:
As to the anova, we can perform multiple comparison via TukeyHSD.
But as to chi-square test for frequency table,how to perform multiple comparison?

For example, if I want to compare 3 samples' ratio(the data has 3 rows,each row corresponds to 1 sample,and has 2 columns,each column corresponds to positive and negative respectively).


dat<-matrix(c(6,30,8,23,14,3),nrow=3)
dat
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]    6   23
[2,]   30   14
[3,]    8    3



chisq.test(dat)

       Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  dat
X-squared = 17.9066, df = 2, p-value = 0.0001293


The result shows that the difference between the 3 samples is significant.But if I want to perform multiple comparison to find out which pair of samples is  significantly different,which function should be used?


Many thanks for your help.

My best

Michael,

Thanks for your response.  

I tried table(table(Bmat)) and it gave me the following error:
[  Error in table(Bmat) : object 'Bmat' not found]

FYI--
"values" contains 16,383 observations ranging from 0 to less than 1.

I just tested your code on my debian install with no problems. RStudio
server logs messages to /var/log/messages (on redhat). Does running:

$ cat /var/log/messages |grep rsession

$ cat /var/log/messages |grep rserver

in the shell give any clues?

In keeping with the theme of reducing unnecessary overhead
(and using William's example data)

> system.time( vAve <- ave(a, i, FUN=cummax) )
   user  system elapsed
  0.125   0.003   0.127
> system.time( b <- unlist( lapply( split(a,i) , cummax) ) )
   user  system elapsed
  0.320   0.007   0.327
> system.time( b <- unlist( lapply( split(a,i) , cummax) ,
>use.names=FALSE) )
   user  system elapsed
  0.067   0.001   0.068



> all.equal(vAve, b)
[1] TRUE

Apparently, quite a bit of overhead associated with keeping the names when
unlisting.

You do understand that this is entirely a volunteer effort, do you
not? There is no guarantee that you will get any response at all, nor
that any that you do receive is actually helpful -- or even correct!
Caveat Emptor! (and your of getting useful help would probably be
improved by following the posting guide and exhibiting courteous,
respectful behavior to those who are volunteering their time to assist
you).

Subject: [R] No map background showed up when adding tile in leaflet()
Message-ID: <04555991BCE2934483554C4DD31D51344CC11E48@EXCHMBFF232.Utility.pge.com>

Hey All,

I am learning to create a map with leaflet(), but my default map background won't show up, its just grey.

Here is my code:

leaflet() %>% addTiles()
addCircleMarkers(lng=points$lon,lat=points$lat,
                         radius=6,stroke=FALSE,fillOpacity = 0.5)

When I run the code, the markers show up and interaction of zoom in/out works okay, but background is always solid grey, not sure why. I tried "addProviderTiles("Stamen.TonerLabels")" as well, does not work out.

Thanks for your help in advance.

Message-ID: <D3637D0C.174709%macqueen1@llnl.gov>

You will probably have to contact the maintainer of the package, since the
error appears to be generated inside the package's function.

Immediately after the error, type
  traceback()
The results might give you a clue. Or they might not!

There might be some requirements on the second argument of the
DefineGame() function. Check the help page for DefineGame and see if the
object you supplied, value, meets those requirements.

What is a good way to grep multiple strings (say in a vector)? In the 
following, I grep ants, cats, and fox separately and concatenate them, 
is there a way to grep the trio in one action? Thanks.

all<-c("ants","birds","cats","dogs","elks","fox"); all
[1] "ants"  "birds" "cats"  "dogs"  "elks"  "fox"
some<-c("ants","cats","fox"); some
[1] "ants" "cats" "fox"
j<-c(
   grep(some[1],all,value=F),
   grep(some[2],all,value=F),
   grep(some[3],all,value=F)); j; all[j]
[1] 1 3 6
[1] "ants" "cats" "fox"

I use my own functions multiGrep and multiGrepl:

multiGrep = function(patterns, x, ..., sort = TRUE, invert = FALSE)
{
  if (invert)
  {
    out = multiIntersect(lapply(patterns, grep, x, ..., invert = TRUE))
  } else
    out = unique(unlist(lapply(patterns, grep, x, ..., invert = FALSE)));
  if (sort) out = sort(out);
  out;
}

multiGrepl = function(patterns, x, ...)
{
  mat = do.call(cbind, lapply(patterns, function(p)
as.numeric(grepl(p, x, ...))));
  rowSums(mat)>0;
}

> multiGrep(some, all)
[1] 1 3 6

> multiGrepl(some, all)
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

multiGrep(some, all, invert = TRUE)
[1] 2 4 5

I dn't have a lot of experience at this but I can say that at least one person whose experience I trust recentlyreported in Rhelp that RSelenium tends to be a fragile interface. Nonetheless, he does use it on occasion and it clearly "works" on more than one platform. If your code is not confidential and the website has at least a guest login capacity, you could post it here and ask for trial runs on whatever platform(s) you may not have testing capacities for.

It appears your question is which row(s) are contributing most greatly to the overall test of independence. The result of a `chisq.test(.)` (which is not what you see from its print method) has a component named residuals. (Read the help page : ?chisq.test)

x2 <- chisq.test(dat)
x2$residuals
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,] -2.3580463  2.4731398
[2,]  1.4481733 -1.5188569
[3,]  0.9323855 -0.9778942



Those row sums should be distributed as chi-squared statistics with one degree of freedom each, but since you have admittedly inflated the possibility of the type I error, it would be sensible to adjust the "p-statistics" using the function that Jim Lemon misspelled:

> rowSums(x2$residuals^2)
[1] 11.676803  4.404132  1.825620

> p.adjust( 1- pchisq( rowSums(x2$residuals^2), 1) )

[1] 0.001898526 0.071703921 0.176645786

So row 1 represents the only group that is "significantly different at the conventional level" from the expectations based on the overall sample collection. I also seem to remember that there is a function named CrossTable (in a package whose name I'm forgetting) that will deliver a SAS-style tabulation of row and column chi-squared statistics.

Subject: [R] Change sum of squares type for ANOVA
Message-ID: <6D5C009FB51EBD41BEE57F4C002350FD09E63F@SB00112A.adb.intra.admin.ch>

Dear R-list members,

I compared my statistics with my supervisor yesterday. He is using STATISTICA, I am using R. We both loaded the same data-file and did a two-way ANOVA with treatment and trial as factors; treatment means were then compared to the untreated control using Dunnett's test. Surprisingly, we got different values, especially the F values differed. In the following Dunnett's test, some treatments were significant in R, but not in STATISTICA. We checked the basic settings of the programs and found out, that STATISTICA is using "sigma-restricted parametrization" and "type VI sum of squares" for the calculations, but so far, I could not find any information about the sum of squares type, which is applied in R. Is it possible, that these settings are the reason for the different values we got? And how can I change in R these settings?

Here the code I used:
bt_assay_devtime_Model <- aov(developmenttime~treatment+run+treatment*run, data=bt_assay)
summary(bt_assay_devtime_Model)
postHocs_bt_assay_devtime <- glht(bt_assay_devtime_Model, linfct=mcp(treatment="Dunnett"), base=1)
summary(postHocs_bt_assay_devtime)
confint(postHocs_bt_assay_devtime)

Thanks a lot for your help!

Getting nicer looking axis ticks  for log-scale axes (and
traditional graphics) I have created the function
   eaxis()
and utility function    pretty10exp(.)

and I also created standard R's  axTicks(.)  to help with these.

    if(!require("sfsmisc")) install.packages("sfsmisc")
    require("sfsmisc")

    x <- lseq(1e-10, 0.1, length = 201)
    plot(x, pt(x, df=3), type = "l", xaxt = "n", log = "x")
    eaxis(1)

gives the attached plot

Subject: [R] Linear Regressions with non-negativity constraint
Message-ID: <d04734bb787f416890ea8163f658641f@PLONINEXMS136.maninvestments.ad.man.com>

Hi all,

I hope you are doing well?

I'm currently using lm() to estimate a linear multi-factor (5 factors without intercept) model as follows ...

factor.lm <- lm(y~x1+x2+x3+x4+x5-1, data = data.frame.rbind)

Using nnls(A,b) I estimated the same model, extended by a non-negativity constraint on the 5 independent factors. It works quite well but unfortunately nnls() only returns the x estimates. Is there a way to extract the Std.Errors, t-values, p-valuess and R^2 as well?

Thanks in advance and kind regards, 
Aljosa

The nls2 package can be used to get starting values.

If I would like to force all my coefficients to be inside an interval, let?s say, between 0 and 1, what kind of starting values are normally recommended for the start argument (e.g. Using a 4 factor model with b1, b2, b3 and b4, I tried start = list(b1 = 0.5, b2 = 0.5, b3 = 0.5, b4 = 0.5))? I also tried other starting values ... Hence, the outputs are very sensitive to that start argument?

Subject: [R] stopifnot() doesnt work as I expect it to. Are my expectations
	correct?
Message-ID: <CANBHdu_t9KSuX6WiJ_gELSo9_x_Kd681fw1hd4JWe-xijhQwCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

*stopifnot(FALSE, someOtherExpression)*

For the above code I expect stopifnot() to always say that 'FALSE is not
TRUE' regardless of what someOtherExpression is(It may evaluate to TRUE or
FALSE or throw an error). Is my expectation correct? Is that how
stopifnot() is supposed to work?

The present implementation of stopifnot() does not work like that. If
someOtherExpression would throw an error, then stopifnot() throws that
error instead of saying 'FALSE is not TRUE'.

So, I modified the source code of stopifnot() and now it works as I expect
it to.
If that is how stopifnot() is supposed to work, then kindly let me know how
I can contribute my solution

It appears your question is which row(s) are contributing most greatly to the overall test of independence. The result of a `chisq.test(.)` (which is not what you see from its print method) has a component named residuals. (Read the help page : ?chisq.test)

x2 <- chisq.test(dat)
x2$residuals
          [,1]       [,2]
[1,] -2.3580463  2.4731398
[2,]  1.4481733 -1.5188569
[3,]  0.9323855 -0.9778942



Those row sums should be distributed as chi-squared statistics with one degree of freedom each, but since you have admittedly inflated the possibility of the type I error, it would be sensible to adjust the "p-statistics" using the function that Jim Lemon misspelled:

> rowSums(x2$residuals^2)
[1] 11.676803  4.404132  1.825620

> p.adjust( 1- pchisq( rowSums(x2$residuals^2), 1) )

[1] 0.001898526 0.071703921 0.176645786

So row 1 represents the only group that is "significantly different at the conventional level" from the expectations based on the overall sample collection. I also seem to remember that there is a function named CrossTable (in a package whose name I'm forgetting) that will deliver a SAS-style tabulation of row and column chi-squared statistics.

Is it possible, that these settings are the reason for the different values we got? And how can I change in R these settings?

Don,

Thank you for your helpful response.  At this point, I do believe it is a package error and I have contacted the developer.

Thanks,
Lisa

You will probably have to contact the maintainer of the package, since the error appears to be generated inside the package's function.

Immediately after the error, type
  traceback()
The results might give you a clue. Or they might not!

There might be some requirements on the second argument of the
DefineGame() function. Check the help page for DefineGame and see if the object you supplied, value, meets those requirements.

Dear Michael and Michael,

I took a quick look at the Statistica website, and their definition of "types" of sums of squares doesn't appear to be the same as the common definition, which originated with SAS. As I read their materials, what they call "Type VI" sums of squares would correspond to the "Type III" tests provided by Anova() in the car package by setting type=3. 

As well, the reference to "sigma-restricted coding" in the Statistica documentation corresponds to contrasts provided by contr.sum() in R. This is important for Type III tests because it produces a row-basis for the model matrix with orthogonal effects. One way to do this is via options(contrasts=c("contr.sum", "contr.poly")). See ?Anova for more information.

I hope this helps,
 John

Dear Michael F

What you say is of course true but Michael E (or possibly Simone) seems 
to be using a function glht from an unnamed package. Since we do not 
have the data or the offending output it is hard to be sure though.

The documentation is unclear on that.  First it implies all expressions 
are evaluated:  "If any of the expressions in ... are not all TRUE, stop 
is called, producing an error message indicating the first of the 
elements of ... which were not true."

But then the "conceptually equivalent" code acts the way you expected.

However, it doesn't really make sense to me to put in tests that could 
themselves trigger errors unless you'd be interested in seeing those 
errors, so I don't think I'd change it.

The following usage of stopifnot seems reasonable to me and it
would be nice if the 2nd call caused the message 'is.data.frame(df) is not
TRUE'.

f <- function(df) {
    stopifnot(is.data.frame(df), is.integer(df$ID))
    range(df$ID)
}
f(data.frame(ID=4:7))
# [1] 4 7

Message-ID: <CABwicxgRV-MW6NGEt7y=zv4pVAELFWzFgvFs1oxuSin9oj5QGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I want to estimate the following SEM model:

Y1 = a0 + b0*D + c0* Y3 + d0 * Y3 * D + control variables
Y2 = a1 + b1*D + c1 *Y3 + d1 * Y3 * D + control variables
Y3 = a2 + b2*D + c2 *Y1 + d2 * Y1 * D + e2*Y2 + f2 * Y2* D + control
variables


where, D is dummy variable, Y1,  Y2 and Y3 are endogenous variables and
Y1*D, Y2*D, Y3*D represent the interaction terms.

Suppose I have Z as an instrument for Y2. Then, can I use Z*D as instrument
for Y2*D and similarly for others?


Regards
Sukant

Subject: [R] Plots for lmrob function

Dear R-helpers,

I have fitted a robust regression using lmrob function from robustbase package. I try to get the different plots for diagnostics of residuals and others. I can't get them, a window opens but nothing appears on it (the window remains white, no graph appears) and I get this error messages.


Here is a small reproducible example


a=c(1231,1415,1256,3242,3121,1567)
b=c(12,34.3,43.5,23.5,12,54.3)
c=c(23,56,73,21,34,45)
d=c(43,11,15,65,76,34)
library("robustbase")
fit=lmrob(a~b+c+d)
plot(fit,plot=all)

Erreur dans plot.new() : attempt to plot on null device

I have an open device :
dev.cur()

null device 
1 

How can I solve my problem and finally get the different required plots ?


Best
S

Yes, that's an example where the proposed behaviour makes sense.  But

stopifnot(is.data.frame(df)); stopifnot(is.integer(df$ID))

isn't that much harder to type, and it already does what you want.

Hello,

Every time I try to require(rjags) in Studio, Studio crashes and says that
a fatal error has occurred. This seems to happen when it's trying to
require coda, which I have installed. All of my software is updated. Anyone
else encountered this before? The package does seem to load successfully in
regular R, but I would prefer not to be constrained to that platform if
possible.

Since this is RStudio-specific, you'll need to ask on one of the RStudio 
forums.

A "null device" is not going to be of much help. Generally one would have an available interactive device. On a Mac this would be the quartz device:

quartz

That said I also get a different error. I am running with the 'error' option set to `recover`, so I see only a single plot of the "Robust Standardized residuals" before an error is reported. I intially wondered is this is caused by using such a small dataset for a model when requesting three predictors and an outcome.

> plot(fit,plot=all)
recomputing robust Mahalanobis distances
saving the robust distances 'MD' as part of ?fit?
Hit <Return> to see next plot: 
Error in plot.it && missing(ylim) : invalid 'x' type in 'x && y'
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In plot.window(...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
2: In plot.xy(xy, type, ...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
3: In axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...) :
  "plot" is not a graphical parameter
4: In axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...) :
  "plot" is not a graphical parameter
5: In box(...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
6: In title(...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
7: In plot.xy(xy.coords(x, y), type = type, ...) :
  "plot" is not a graphical parameter
8: In title(sub = sub.caption, ...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter

But reducing the model did not cure the error. Only removing `plot=all` was sufficient to get plotting of all five plots. The help page for plot.lmrob does not describe a "plot" parameter.

Subject: [R] Multistate survival models
Message-ID: <573F650B.7050501@utoronto.ca>

A quick (I think) question.

Does the survreg() function in the survival package handle Surv() 
objects of type mstate?

It's not clear from the documentation that it doesn't. The Vignette only 
discusses the Cox model and the Fine-Gray model.

I tried using survreg() on an mstate Surv() object. It did not give an 
error and produced a result but I don't know if it did a competing risk 
analysis or not.

Thanks.

Hi all;
I have a big data set (a small part is given below) and V1 column has repeated info in it. That is rs941873, rs12307687... are repeating many times. I need choose only one SNP (in first column named rs) which has the smallest ?Pvalue withing V1 column. That is I need choose only one SNP for repeated names in V1 which has the smallest Pvalue.

Message-ID: <2046958597.14381.1463778378865.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

I am?using ddply on?a data set that contains 2+ million rows; trying to rank the values of a variable within groups, and then transform the ranks to (approximate) z-scores --- i.e generate quantiles on the normal scale.
Here is some sample data for one group:x <- NA 0.3640951 0.1175880 0.3453916 0.4214050 0.7469022 0.1091423 0.6099482? ? ? ? NA? ? ? ? NA 0.6786140 0.1785854 0.9750262? ? ? ? NA

I have tried the following two alternatives:?
(1) Using the qnorm function from the stats package in conjunction with the percent_rank function from the dplyr? package:For example:
y <- qnorm(percent_rank(x))
This produces -Inf and Inf for the extreme values in the sample data. This issue is resolved if I use the rank function from the stats package instead, for example:y <- qnorm(rank(x, na.last = "keep", ties.method = "average")/length(x))
but if there are no NAs in a certain group, the upper extreme data point is still evaluated to Inf.
(2) Using the ztransform function from the GenABEL package:
For example: 
y <- ztransform(percent_rank(x))
This preserves the extreme values but produces one of the following types of errors when used on my full data set.

Error in ztransform(x) : trait is binary
ORError in ztransform(x) : trait is monomorphic
I suspect these errors may be due to the fact that there are very few observations and/or several missing values (NAs) within certain groups, but I am not sure since there are several hundred groups.? 
Is there a better way?

The reason your data is garbled is that you failed to configure your email client to post in plain text. Please read the posting guide and the listinfo for r-help. You should also clarify what you want. Do you want only one line per SNP so the result would be another dataframe with a reduced number of lines of data?

Can you "back up" a bit and present the _theory_  you have in mind that lets you assess the GOF?

You should also search the r-help archives because this is a recurring question here.

Subject: [R] lib default location
Message-ID: <CAJDAfTD9qh1b_5DE029o9xtSy6MqLMCDF9W6XdQyypxL+bscKg@mail.gmail.com>

Everytime I install a package from CRAN I receive this message:

Installing package into ?/home/albap/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3?
(as ?lib? is unspecified)

Should I set my lib? If so, what's the recommended path?

Also, everytime I have to choose the mirror. Could I make one of them default?

Thanks!
Ciao.

It is fine to keep this per user default.

Yes, one way is described in the examples of ?Startup.

Hi all,

Here is my df and I want to make an averaged model of my variables based on Time like the following:

    
   $ Protocol   : Factor w/ 48 levels "DP FS QTSE SAG",..: 2 3 43 42 
   $ Time       : num  182 185 189 234 186 ... 

   $ Systemtype   : Factor w/ 2 levels "Aera XJ","AERA XQ": 1 1 1 
   $ ADJ        : Factor w/ 2 levels "auto","manu": 1 1 
   $ BR         : int  384 384 384 384 512 384
   $ TF         : int  10 10 13 7 7 5 5 
I split my df into quartiles for time,

   
   df$quant=findInterval(df$Time, quantile(df$Time), rightmost.closed=TRUE)
by the column df$quant I see quartiles 1 to 4 for time, next I want to create a new column for example for BR and if df$quant==1 then put mean of first quartile of BR in that,if df$quant==2 put mean of second quartile of BR in that and so on. I do the same for every numeric variable. Does anyone know how to that?


Thanks for any help!

Perhaps, but untested in the absence of a reproducible example and choosing to instead use a name for the dataframe which is not also a function name:

aggregate( dfrm[ , sapply( dfrm, inherits, "numeric")],   # logical indexing for `[, j]`
           dfrm['quant']      # using "[" keeps it a list
           mean)

Hi Chalabi,

Maybe you can use ddply to look over the intervals and add the means as new
colum

Best wishes

Dear R users:

I have written the following lines :

>b=solve(t(X)%*% X)%*% t(X)%*% y

when I wrote the following line
>(t(y-X %*% b)%*%(y-X %*% b)/(length(y)-ncol(X)))*solve(t(X)%*% X)
I have obtained an error message, I don't know why namely (t(y-X %*%

Can you please help me.

Mistake is that (t(y-X %*% b)%*%(y-X %*% b)/(length(y)-ncol(X))) is NOT a scalar, but a 1 x 1 matrix. 

This works:

as.vector((t(y-X %*% b)%*%(y-X %*% b))/(length(y)-ncol(X)))*solve(t(X)%*% X)

as does recognizing the first term as a sum of squares:

sum((y-X %*% b)^2)/(length(y)-ncol(X))*solve(t(X)%*% X)

(And, for the Illuminati, a Kronecker product works too:

(t(y-X %*% b)%*%(y-X %*% b)/(length(y)-ncol(X))) %x% solve(t(X)%*% X)

This could be useful for multivariate y.)

Roy,

Yes, t(y-X %*% b) is the transpose of y-X %*% b. In principle the product
of  t(y-X %*% b) *(y-X %*% b) is a scalar, I don't know why I have an error
message after the following line:

(t(y-X %*% b)%*%(y-X %*% b)/(length(y)-ncol(X)))*solve(t(X)%*% X)

Thanks

I don't know if there is some sort of propagation delay, but the reason has already been given and multiple fixes suggested.

Note that you can suppress the somewhat redundant message by specifying 
quiet=TRUE in the call to install.packages().

Hi all;
I have a big data set (a small part is given below) and V1 column has repeated info in it. That is rs941873, rs12307687... are repeating many times. I need choose only one SNP (in first column named rs) which has the smallest ?Pvalue withing V1 column. That is I need choose only one SNP for repeated names in V1 which has the smallest Pvalue.
Your helps are truly appreciated,Oslo

Hello,

First of all, it's better to post data using ?dput. Below, I give an  
example of that? in the lines structure(...).
dat <-
structure(list(rs = c("?? rs941873? ", "?? rs634552? ", "?? rs11107175? ",
"?? rs12307687? ", "?? rs3917155? ", "?? rs1600640? ", "?? rs2871865? ",
"?? rs2955250? ", "?? rs228758? ", "?? rs224333? ", "?? rs4681725? ",
"?? rs7652177? ", "?? rs925098? ", "?? rs1662837? ", "?? rs10071837? "
), n0 = c(81139462, 75282052, 94161719, 47175866, 76444685, 84603034,
99194896, 61959740, 42148205, 34023962, 56692321, 171969077,
17919811, 82168889, 33381581), Pvalue = c(1.52e-07, 0.108, 0.0285,
0.123, 0.68, 0.000275, 0.0709, 0.0317, 0.0772, 0.021, 0.000445,
0.000634, 5.55e-09, 8.66e-05, 0.000574), V1 = c("rs941873", "rs941873",
"rs941873", "rs12307687", "rs941873", "rs12307687", "rs12307687",
"rs12307687", "rs12307687", "rs10071837", "rs10071837", "rs10071837",
"rs925098", "rs925098", "rs925098")), .Names = c("rs", "n0",
"Pvalue", "V1"), row.names = c(NA, -15L), class = "data.frame")

Now, if I understand correctly, the following might do what you want.

tmp <- split(dat[, "Pvalue"], dat[, "V1"])
idx <- unlist(lapply(tmp, function(x) x == min(x)))[order(order(dat[, "V1"]))]
rm(tmp)
result <- dat[idx, ]
result

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Contrast matrix with a continuous variable
Message-ID: <DUB123-W4451CDC1BC062754278F43C44D0@phx.gbl>





















Hello everyone, 


I was wondering if could help me designing a
contrast matrix when you have a continuous variable (Days).  


 


My model looks like
this: 


 


model<-lme(Y~A*B*Days,
data=data_over_time) 


 


The factor A hast
two levels (A1 and A2) and factor B has three levels (B1, B2, and B3). I
measured the response variable Y every two or three days over 70 days
(Days).  


I need to look at
only a few comparisons over the 70 days such us: 


                                   A1 and B1 vs A2 and B1,  


                                   A2 and B2 vs
A2 and B1,  


                                   A1 and B2 vs
A2 and B2


I could use the
function contrast from the package contrast to design the matrix with the three
comparisons mentioned above for specific days at a time. However, I need to run
the comparison over the 70 days not at individual time points. 


 


I was wondering if
you could help me designing this contrast matrix. 


 


Any help would be
much appreciated.

 same data, different results

<http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/213592/r-vs-spss-simple-effects-analysis-in-mixed-2x2-anova-scheme-same-data-diffe#>

Hello,

I prepared a mixed 2x2 ANOVA design analysis both in SPSS and in R. The
SPSS script is correct, but in R script there is a mistake somewhere. To
test that I generated artificial data from a normal distribution to
simulate the interaction between two independent variables. There were no
difference between the results in main effects, but results of simple
effects analysis do not match when comparing between levels of variable
which introduced repeated measures (GROUP A: PRE vs POST ; GROUP B: PRE vs
POST).

I would be very thankful if you can help me. The code below will do
everything for you.

*Here is the code in R which:* - generates the data - calculates mixed
ANOVA - prepares data to csv format to import to SPSS - performs simple
effect analysis (there is probably a mistake)

N <- 100
absMean <- 1
sdCustom <- 5

grA_pre <- data.frame(ID = seq(N), lvl=rnorm(N, mean=absMean,
sd=sdCustom), group=factor('A'), stage = factor('pre'))
grA_post <- data.frame(ID = seq(N), lvl=rnorm(N, mean=-absMean,
sd=sdCustom), group=factor('A'), stage = factor('post'))
grB_pre <- data.frame(ID = seq(N+1,2*N), lvl=rnorm(N, mean=-absMean,
sd=sdCustom), group=factor('B'), stage = factor('pre'))
grB_post <- data.frame(ID = seq(N+1,2*N), lvl=rnorm(N, mean=absMean,
sd=sdCustom), group=factor('B'), stage = factor('post'))

gr <- rbind(grA_pre, grA_post, grB_pre, grB_post)
names(gr)
head(gr)
# save set to .csv to import to SPSS
grSPSS <- reshape(data = gr, timevar = "stage", idvar = c("ID",
"group"), direction = "wide")

write.csv2(grSPSS, file = "sample2.csv")

library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(ez)
print("Omnibus mixed ANOVA - main effects and interactions")
ezPlot(data = gr, wid = ID, dv = lvl, between = group, within = stage,
type = "III", x = group, split = stage, x_lab = "Group", y_lab =
"Level of experience")
ezANOVA(data = gr, wid = ID, dv = lvl, between = group, within =
stage, detailed = TRUE, type = "III")#ezStats(data = gr, wid = ID, dv
= lvl, between = group, within = stage, type = "III")

print("Simple main effects analysis")
dataA <- subset(gr, group == "A" )
dataB <- subset(gr, group == "B" )
dataPRE <- subset(gr, stage == "pre" )
dataPOST <- subset(gr, stage == "post" )
print("GROUP = A: PRE vs POST")
simpleEffControlANOVA <- ezANOVA(data = dataA, dv = lvl, wid = ID,
within = stage, detailed = TRUE, type = "III"
)print(simpleEffControlANOVA)
print("GROUP = B: PRE vs POST")
simpleEffControlANOVA <- ezANOVA(data = dataB, dv = lvl, wid = ID,
within = stage, detailed = TRUE, type = "III"
)print(simpleEffControlANOVA)
print("STAGE = PRE: A vs B")
simpleEffControlANOVA <- ezANOVA(data = dataPRE, dv = lvl, wid = ID,
between = group, detailed = TRUE, type = "III"
)print(simpleEffControlANOVA)
print("STAGE = POST: A vs B")
simpleEffControlANOVA <- ezANOVA(data = dataPOST, dv = lvl, wid = ID,
between = group, detailed = TRUE, type = "III"
)print(simpleEffControlANOVA)

*Here is the code for SPSS Syntax which:* - calculates everything on

The only people who will be able to help you are people who use both R 
and SPSS as you do not show the result from either. So even though they 
can re-run your R commands they cannot compare them with SPSS.

Subject: [R] if else condition - help
Message-ID: <CAL2fYnP3TOHBF=5vsGtpaEM8M8_dOSR26q2rnHhj6jgihNF=ZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi group:
I am having difficulty with if else condition. I kindly request some help.

I have a matrix k

> k
           C1         C2         C3         C4
A  0.09902175 -0.1083887  0.2018689 -0.3546167

D -2.91485614  2.9201895 -2.4771802 -2.6991517

I want to convert values > 1.5 to 1, < -1.5 to -1 and rest to 0;

> k1 - desired output
           C1         C2         C3         C4

D           -1        1            -1           -1


I am trying with if else but cannot do it. I could only define one
condition.  Could someone help how I can do this. I dont mean only if
else, but any other way.

k =
structure(c(0.0990217544905328, 1.60623837694539, -0.104331330281166,

k1 <- t(apply(k, 1, function(x) ifelse(x > 1.5,1,-1)))

Thanks

Hi Adrian I'm not sure that you need to use the ifelse here.  You can simply
assign values ina vector or matrix using a simple condition -- here is a simple
example:

v<-c(4,5,6,7)
v1<-v
v1[]<-0
v1[v<5]<--1
v1[v>6]<-1
v1

A "null device" is not going to be of much help. Generally one would have an available interactive device. On a Mac this would be the quartz device:

> dev.cur()
quartz 
? ? 2 


That said I also get a different error. I am running with the 'error' option set to `recover`, so I see only a single plot of the "Robust Standardized residuals" before an error is reported. I intially wondered is this is caused by using such a small dataset for a model when requesting three predictors and an outcome.

> plot(fit,plot=all)
recomputing robust Mahalanobis distances
saving the robust distances 'MD' as part of ?fit?
Hit <Return> to see next plot: 
Error in plot.it && missing(ylim) : invalid 'x' type in 'x && y'
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In plot.window(...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
2: In plot.xy(xy, type, ...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
3: In axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...) :
? "plot" is not a graphical parameter
4: In axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...) :
? "plot" is not a graphical parameter
5: In box(...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
6: In title(...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter
7: In plot.xy(xy.coords(x, y), type = type, ...) :
? "plot" is not a graphical parameter
8: In title(sub = sub.caption, ...) : "plot" is not a graphical parameter

But reducing the model did not cure the error. Only removing `plot=all` was sufficient to get plotting of all five plots. The help page for plot.lmrob does not describe a "plot" parameter.

Thank you both Dylan and Wray.

since my matrix is quite large and for simplicity in downstream
operation, i will use sign function. thanks a lot.

If the problems were somewhat less symmetric or  more complex this would be a method that could be easily generalized to a larger number of less "absolutely" symmetric intervals:

 k2 <- k
 k2[] <- findInterval(k2, c(-Inf, -1.5, 1.5, Inf) ) -2  
                                             # shifts the 1-3 values to -1 to 1
 k2
  C1 C2 C3 C4
A  0  0  0  0
B  1  0  0  0
C  0 -1  0  0
D -1  1 -1 -1

Using k2[] <- ... preserves the matrix structure

Subject: [R] Merging 2 files with different timestamp
Message-ID: <CAEGXkYXxDQJR81Q+q6AQTuT69E6gAwd-v9UHS7qAwByLQXdNfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I am trying to merge two text files by using the timestamp
header for both the files:

The first file has the following format for the timestamp:"2012-01-01
23:30:00 UTC"

Timestamp for the second file : 2012-01-01 2330.

I am having problems by converting from one timestamp format to another.
Any suggestions/help in this regard?

Hello,

My apologies for the earlier posting. There was an error with regard to my
query :


I am trying to merge two text files by using the timestamp
header for both the files:

The first file has the following format for the timestamp:"27-Dec-12 23H
30M 0S"

Timestamp for the second file : 2012-12-27 2330.

I am having problems by converting from one timestamp format to another.
Any suggestions/help in this regard?

regards,

Is this the format of a column within the two different files?  If they are
columns, here is a way of converting to a common format for merging:

Subject: [R] mgcv::gam(): NA parametric coefficient in a model with two
 categorical variables + model interpretation
Message-ID: <CAAO1NneNOjwWCyva-yP6Bz5D5hSBrmaqBXitwW9Md2c-nt1JRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hallo all

I am using a gam model for my data.

m2.4<-bam(acc~ 1 + igc + s(ctrial, by=igc) + shape + s(ctrial, by=shape) +
s(ctrial, sbj, bs = "fs", m = 1) , data=data, family=binomial)

igc codes condition and there are four levels (CAT.pseudo,
CAT.ideo,PA.pseudo, PA.ideo), and shape is a factor (that cannot be
considered random effect) with four levels too (rand21, rand22, rand23,
rand30).

Here is the summary of the model
> summary(m2.4)

Family: binomial
Link function: logit

Formula:
acc ~ 1 + igc + s(ctrial, by = igc) + shape + s(ctrial, by = shape) +
    s(ctrial, sbj, bs = "fs", m = 1)

Parametric coefficients:

I am not sure how this model works, but I guess it creates four smooths for
each level of condition, and four smooths for each level of shape.

There is also the intercept of the model, set at the reference level of
condition (CAT.pseudo) and at the reference level of shape (rand21). Each
parametric term represents the difference of each level of each of the two
factors from the intercept.

I have two questions

Q1:
Does anyone now why I get NA results in the second line of the parametric
terms?

Q2:
The term igcCAT.ideo denotes the difference in the intercept between
(A): condition=igcCAT.ideo,  and
(B): (condition=igcCATpseudo ) &(shape=rand21).
But what is the value (level) of shape for (A)?
Is it the reference level? Or is it, perhaps, the "grand mean" of the shape
variable?


Thank you in advance for your time,

Message-ID: <CAFUx43zrm+845wXtkwFHV=WebT2CCm-S6uORtFzoJQ0GUkSmBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

every one , im using Boolnet package inside R environment to create a
boolean network.

after i create a text file for the Boolean network  and  i loaded it by
using R  by using this command:

 > library(BoolNet)
> loadNetwork("C:/Users/mohammad/Documents/cellcontrol.txt")

then its loaded inside R screen. But when i started to do some of tasks on
this network every time i got this error message, this is an example how i
work on the created network and get the error.

> stateTransition(cellcontrol, rep(1,11))
Error in inherits(network, "BooleanNetwork") :
  object 'cellcontrol' not found
>

please can any one help me to solve this error .

Reagdrs,

Hi Mohammad,
I don't have the BoolNet package installed, but the error means that
the object "cellcontrol" is not there for the function to use. It
should be a network "generated by generateRandomNKNetwork, or
reconstructed by reconstructNetwork" as detailed in the help pages.

Okay, perhaps if you try this:

cellcontrol<-
 loadNetwork("C:/Users/mohammad/Documents/cellcontrol.txt")
stateTransition(cellcontrol, rep(1,11))

Obviously this is a guess, but it might help.

Two solutions...

v + matrix(b, nrow(v), ncol(v), byrow = TRUE)

or

t(apply(v, 1, `+`, b))

Subject: [R] need help to convert animal ID to a factor
Message-ID: <CALjSv_eh+GZ1CWsuzWW5Fe+MNZWv8+urgSZq5F3xM46TRXhmjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was trying to convert my animal ID experiment (ID) to factor to get the
ggboxplot, previously it was working well.
But since yesterday it displayed "Error" every time I tried to re-run it.
Could you help me in this issue?


# convert rat ID to factor
Leak.df <- toFactor(Leak.df, id.var=c("ID", "Time"))

>From Console:
> ets.df <- toFactor(ets.df, id.var=c("ID", "Time"))
Error: could not find function "toFactor"

Looking forward for your reply.


Kind regards,
Neny

I've got quite a few packages loaded and yet I get:

> ?toFactor
No documentation for ?toFactor? in specified packages and libraries:
you could try ???toFactor?

So it's a function from some undetermined package and It's not even locatable with sos::findFn. I suspect you have forgotten to load it (whatever _it_ is.

I am not familiar with any function called "toFactor". It may be part of some contributed package that you need to re-load. 

However, one does not ordinarily need to use a package to convert one column of a data frame into a factor, since factors are supported by base R.

Eg

MyDF$ID <- factor( MyDF$ID )

Message-ID: <629e5be9986f472391f68845b92c2de8@PLONINEXMS136.maninvestments.ad.man.com>

Hi all,

I hope you are doing well?

I'm currently using lm() to estimate a linear multi-factor (5 factors without intercept) model as follows ...

factor.lm <- lm(y~x1+x2+x3+x4+x5-1, data = data.frame.rbind)

Using nnls(A,b) I estimated the same model, extended by a non-negativity constraint on the 5 independent factors. It works quite well but unfortunately nnls() only returns the x estimates. Is there a way to extract the Std.Errors, t-values, p-valuess and R^2 as well?

Thanks in advance and kind regards, 
Aljosa

Or, as you're messing with transposes anyways, use the fact that the column-wise counterpart is automagically handled by recycling:

t(t(v)+b)

Or, look Ma, no transposes
 
v + rep(b, each=nrow(v))

(_always_ doublecheck the logic when you apply these and similar techniques! I have seen my share of student code where recycling had been applied along the wrong dimension of a matrix...)

hmm, why should he want that ?
The OP did mention that it's about somewhat large objects, so
efficiency is one of the considerations :

ifelse() is often convenient and nicely self-explaining, but it 
is (because of its generality, but also by its definition)
much *less efficient* than the (sometimes slightly less
convenient) ways you were shown previously in this thread :

- For the generalized case findInterval() is order of magnitudes
  better, and
- for the simple case you were shown to use logical indexing,
  i.e., calls ? la    x[x > k] <- ..


In summary:
   Use  ifelse()  much less -- notably if writing
   functions/code which should scale !

The syntax
mydat <- data.frame( y,x )
fit1 <- lm( y~., data=mydat )
appears to perform a multivariable regression of y on every non-y variable in the data frame mydat. I can not find this syntax (y~.) in R documentation. Is y~. a supported feature of the R language? Where can I find it documented? I would hate to write code that is dependent on a non-supported, non-documented language feature.

It is documented in the Introduction to R manual (hidden in section 
11.5, "Updating fitted models"), and in ?formula, which ?lm refers to.

Hi John,

This is indeed documented, but you'll have to look at the function 
formula():
?formula

Regarding the dot (.), here is the explanation from the help of formula():
"There are two special interpretations of . in a formula. The usual one 
is in the context of a data argument of model fitting functions and 
means ?all columns not otherwise in the formula?: see terms.formula. In 
the context of update.formula, only, it means ?what was previously in 
this part of the formula?."

HTH,
Ivan

It's about formula syntax, so ?formula documents it.

~ igc + s(ctrial) + s(ctrial,by=igc)
- see section on `by' variables in ?gam.models.

Hi All,

the solution for my question is as follows

## Filter duplicates and correpsonding non-duplicates
### To filter duplicates and their corresponding non-duplicates use the
### following code snippet:
Debitor <- c("968691", "968691", "968691",
             "A04046", "A04046",
             "L0006", "L0006", "L0006",
             "L0023", "L0023",
             "L0056", "L0056",
             "L0094", "L0094", "L0094",
             "L0124", "L0124",
             "L0143", 
             "L0170",
             "13459",
             "473908",
             "394704",
             "4711",
             "4712",
             "4713")
Debitor <- as.character(Debitor)
var1 <- c(11, 12, 13,
          14, 14,
          12, 13, 14,
          10, 11,
          12, 12,
          12, 12, 12,
          15, 17,
          11,
          14,
          12,
          17,
          13,
          15,
          16,
          11)
ds_example <- data.frame(Debitor, var1)
ds_example$case_id <- 1:nrow(ds_example)
ds_example <- ds_example[, sort(colnames(ds_example))]
ds_example

# This task is to generate a data frame that contains the duplicates AND 
the
# corresponding non-duplicates to the duplicates.
# For example, finding the duplicates will deliver case 2 and 3 but the 
list
# should also contain case 1 because case 1 is the corresponding case to 
the
# duplicate cases 2 and 3.
# For the whole example dataset that would be:
needed <- c(1, 1, 1,
            1, 1,
            1, 1, 1,
            1, 1,
            1, 1,
            1, 1, 1,
            1, 1,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
needed <- as.logical(needed)
ds_example <- data.frame(ds_example, needed)
ds_example

# To find the duplicates and the corresponding non-duplicates
duplicates <- duplicated(ds_example$Debitor)

list_of_duplicated_debitors <- as.character(ds_example[duplicates, 
"Debitor"])

filter_variable <- unique(list_of_duplicated_debitors)

### Wrong code. Do not run.
### ds_duplicates <- ds_example["Debitor" == filter_variable]  # Result: 
dataset with 0 columns
### duplicates_and_correponding_non_duplicates <- ds_example["Debitor"] 
%in% filter_variable  # Result: FALSE

duplicates_and_correponding_non_duplicates <- ds_example$Debitor %in% 
filter_variable  # Result: OK
duplicates_and_correponding_non_duplicates <- ds_example[, "Debitor"] %in% 
filter_variable  # Result: OK

### Create the dataset with duplicates and corresponding non-duplicates
ds_example <- ds_example[duplicates_and_correponding_non_duplicates, ]
ds_example

It was a simple mistake when subscripting.

Kind regards

Perhaps

ds_example <- ds_example[ with( ds_example, 1 < ave( Debitor, Debitor, FUN=length ) ), ]

I need a function, that calculates the mean of a desired amount of normally distributed numbers and repeats this process for a desired number of repetitions. The function should return only a single vector consisting solely of the calculated means. Also the user of this function must be able to specify the parameters of the normal distribution used while calculating the means. I need this function for the Kolmogorov Smirnov Test.
I am a total beginner, so far I only have come to this point:

kolmo <- function(x, mean, sd, rep){
  
  for(i in rep){
    cat(mean(rnorm(x, mean, sd)))
    
}}
This returns a simple number, but I do need a vector to be returned.
Thanks a lot in advance!

Hi Dave, Roy and R-users,

Many thanks for your suggestions - in later correspondence Dave suggested that I ask the data provider to run a md5 checksum on the problem files, and compare their results against a md5 checksum on my copies of the files. Having done this, I found that the results didn't match (which they should do if the files were identical), and so this indicated that some corruption must have occurred during the file transfer.

Unfortunately we haven't discovered the source of the problem, but it was very helpful to learn how to compare files and identify the problem, so thanks very much for your help!

Best wishes,
Louise

Hi Louise:

If Dave can?t figure it out, I can give a look also.  A couple of things I would suggest:

1.  Don?t use the name ?data? in the nc_open command, that is a reserved command in R and you never know what problems that can cause.

2. You are doing calculations to get set the start and count values in the ncvar_get commands, print those values out before you make the calls to make certain they are valid.

HTH,

-Roy

I have trained two models using the caret library for R and would like to
combine the two multi-class trained models into one ensemble.

My first thought was to use caretEnsemble, but it does not yet support
multi-class predictions. See
https://github.com/zachmayer/caretEnsemble/issues/8

Is there a tutorial or sample code you can point me to showing how to

Hi Nicoletta,

You need to read more introductory material.
One of the problems with your code is that you actually don't create any 
value, let alone any vector; you just display it with cat().
Then you try to create each value of your vector with an explicit for 
loop, but you don't need to; replicate() does the job in a compact code.

So if I understand correctly what you want to achieve, I would do this:
kolmo <- function(x, meanR=0, sdR=1, repet=1){
     out <- replicate(repet, mean(rnorm(x, meanR, sdR)))
     return(out)
}
# I changed the names of your arguments to make it less confusing (but I 
wasn't imaginative)
# I set some default values for 'meanR' and 'sdR', which are actually 
the defaults of rnorm()
# 'return(out)' is not necessary but I prefer to explicitly write what I 
want the function to output

Example:
kolmo(x=10, repet=3)

HTH,
Ivan

Actually, it is debatable which one of those deserve to be called "usual". Once upon a time, in the heyday of John Tukey, it might have been usual to have data set of a few hundred rows and, like, a dozen columns, exactly one of which being the response. Not so much these days, I'd say.

Message-ID: <OFBC2106C8.7A59FA6B-ON85257FBC.0056D26D-85257FBC.0057E1BA@ria.buffalo.edu>

R users: 

Suppose I have a function that takes three numeric arguments x, y,  and z, 
any of which may be scalars or vectors.
Suppose further that the user takes one of the arguments, say y, as a 
vector with the other two as scalars.
Is there an existing R function that will promote the other two arguments 
to vectors of the same size?

I know in most cases this is not a problem as the promotion is automatic. 
I need this for a function I am writing
and I don't want to write any additional code to do this if I can help it.

This depends on what you mean by 'promote' ...

If you want to do something like 'recycling', as is often done for plot colours, but need things the same length for subsetting etc, one crude but fairly straightforward way I will confess to using in a function is something like

L <- max( length(x), length(y), length(z) )
x <- rep(x, length.out=L) 
y <- rep(y, length.out=L) 
z <- rep(z, length.out=L)

If you wanted to zero-fill to the same length, or fill with NA, that'd be something else ...

Scalar values in R are just vectors of length 1. The "promotion" you are thinking of is "recycling" that automatically occurs when vectors of different lengths are supplied to certain operations. 

One shortcut might be to put them all into a data frame using the data.frame() function.  Otherwise, I think the rep() function and some conditional code would be needed.

For a general overview of R's recycling approach, see:

  https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Vector-arithmetic

and:

  https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#The-recycling-rule

The question is what type of error checking you want to embed in your function, if the lengths of each argument are not the same and that would be a problem. Do you want to presume that a user will pass arguments that fit your a priori expectation, or protect against the possibility that they do not?

What would you do if y is a vector of length 6, x is a vector of length 1 and z is a vector of length 8?

R's default rules would replicate 'x' 8 times (e.g. rep(x, 8)), while extending 'y' by 2 (e.g. y <- y[c(1:6, 1:2)]), so that both have length(z).

You can use something along the lines of:

Max.Len <- max(length(x), length(y), length(z))
x <- rep(x, length.out = Max.Len)
y <- rep(y, length.out = Max.Len)
z <- rep(z, length.out = Max.Len)

which will recycle each as may be needed so that they have a common length.

Only you will know, given your function, if that might result in problems in whatever result your function is intended to generate.

Marc Schwartz

Use 'replicate.'

Will compute return a column vector of length n1, each entry of which is
the mean of n2 random normal variables with mean and sd specified by the
arguments of rnorm.

You have by now seen some other responses on the list. Keeping the list 
included will insure you continue to get mulitple eyes looking at the 
problem and will benefit others trying to use the answers.

Two comments:

1) Your first format includes a specification for seconds. If that is 
nonzero at any point you could have difficulty aligning that data with the 
second format. In some cases this may be desirable, in other cases you may 
prefer to use some kind of "nearest minute" calculation such as 
trunc.POSIXt or round.POSIXt might yield. If you do so, be aware that 
those functions always return POSIXlt, and efficient computation is 
usually obtained with POSIXct, so convert if you have to.

2) It is not necessary to convert back to character as Jim Holtman 
suggests in order to merge the data... working with POSIXct data type 
directly will be more efficient. I would warn against using POSIXlt for 
merging, though, for poor efficiency reasons.

Subject: [R] print all variables inside function
Message-ID: <CAHby=D1NB24-aqfBvk7omFN6VSy45d9rHj0G1wd7L84wfsgLLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello dear R-help

I would like to use some short and simple names multiple times inside
one script without collisions. I need to wrap the variables inside
some object. I know I can use class function or environment. For
example as follows:

exmp1<-function(){

########
# knowns
pa=0.35
pb=0.35
pc=0.30
pad=0.015
pbd=0.010
pcd=0.020
########

########
# unknowns
pd=pa*pad+pb*pbd+pc*pcd
pdc=pc*pcd/pd
pda=pa*pad/pd
pba=pb*pbd/pd
########

y<-c(pad=pad,pbd=pbd,pcd=pcd,pd=pd,pdc=pdc,pda=pda,pba=pba) # this
line I would like to automate so I don't have to write it every time
return(y)
}
output<-exmp1()

Is it somehow possible to print 'Unknows' and 'Knowns' from exmp1
function without the need of explicitly write the 'y' line which puts
all variables inside list? For example with an imaginary function
'fprint' which takes exmp1 as the input: fprint(exmp1).

George,

You are very close.  Try this ...

# make Debitor a character variable in the data frame
ds_example$Debitor <- as.character(ds_example$Debitor)

duplicates <- duplicated(ds_example$Debitor)
duplicated_debitors <- unique(ds_example$Debitor[duplicates])
ds_duplicates <- ds_example[ds_example$Debitor %in% duplicated_debitors, ]

Why create them first?  Just do something like this:

knowns <- c(
  pa=0.35
  pb=0.35
  pc=0.30
  pad=0.015
  pbd=0.010
  pcd=0.020)

Dear Jan,

This will return a list with all objects from within the function.

test <- function(){
  a <- 10
  b <- 3 * a + 1
  x <- -1
  output <- paste(objects(), objects(), sep = "=")
  output <- paste(output, collapse = ",")
  output <- paste("list(", output, ")")
  return(eval(parse(text = output)))
}
test()

Thanks David,

I figured out a way to get the data I want without RSelenium.

Apreciate the help, though.

If you really want to return all the objects in a function, I think it
is better to return as.list(environment()), perhaps adding the
all.names=TRUE argument to capture names starting with a dot.
I only have done this while debugging a function and then I
find it is more convenient to return just environment().

eval(parse(text="...")) will have problems when objects in the
environment have odd names, like 'Two words', '...', or '..1'.

Hello,
I?ve noticed a Warning, while working with both the R console and a document window in R:

I have Version R 3.3.0 GUI 1.68 Mavericks build (7202) installed on my Macbook Pro running Mac OS X 10.11.5 (15F34).

Is this something to worry about? Can anyone help me out? 

I downloaded R from the official servers.

Nope, it comes from OSX. AFAIR, it is something about supporting versions back to 10.6 (Snow Leopard) in the same binary, and the thing that works in 10.6 got deprecated in later versions. It's something that we probably want to fix (something about resolution independence, making a difference with hi-res displays), but I'm unsure whether it can be done without dropping support for the older versions. I think the warning is mostly harmless until Apple drops supporting the function entirely.

Thanks for your advise.
Just wondering, since I have to analyse my data with "Mixed model analysis
in R"
and I'm not familiar at all with this software, just try to use it within a
week and need to write my analysis result as soon as I can, could you
please advise me of what does mixed model analysis mean?


Kind regards,

Subject: [R] Defining contrasts within function
Message-ID: <CAAyVsXJMCsvLR6abhoi_EttwxEbmEvn-aLNyjR51zF046XMOgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I'd like to change the options("contrasts") within a function, such that
"identity" contrasts
are created for unordered factors. I'm following the idea shown below,
which works fine.

However, when I include these functions in a package (with `contr` being
exported, but
`contr_identity` not exported as it is not intended to be called directly
by the user), I get
the following error message. And this is after loading and attaching the
package with library(). Why is `contr_identity` not found?

Error in get(ctr, mode = "function", envir = parent.frame()) :
  object 'contr_identity' of mode 'function' was not found


contr <- function(x) {
ocontrasts <- options(contrasts = c(unordered = "contr_identity", ordered =
"contr.diff"))
on.exit(options(ocontrasts))
contrasts(x)
}

contr_identity <- function(n, contrasts) {
    contr.treatment(n, contrasts = FALSE)
}

f <- gl(2, 8, labels = c("Control", "Treat"))
contrasts(f)
contr(f)

Subject: [R] Replicating the SPlus "twoway" function
Message-ID: <96074A28AAA5424983F8DA582FEDD00F1A5FC5B5@EX10MBOX02.pnnl.gov>

Is there a package somewhere that replicates the SPlus twoway() function?  That function models a 2-d data matrix, which may contain NAs, as

x[i,j] = grand.effect + row.effect[i] + col.effect[j] + resid[i,j]

I'm sort of resurrecting some ancient S code and it would be handy if a twoway() function were available in R.  I've googled and RSiteSearch'd, but maybe there's something out there that goes by another name?

Thanks.

Subject: [R] heat color on age visible on ordination
Message-ID: <CAPL76w8Pi42i1Rp9fvVACw7z1jS--0=ChNBFJA3FRUj_9Dsh9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I have a big matrix spread over a long time period.
I would like to make a ordination plot (PCA, CA, DCA etc) of this matrix
and look for patterns on time by exploring a color scheme (I have heat
color in mind).
The idea is to use a progressive color scheme ranging from red (the oldest
age) until purple (the youngest one). Then, make a ordination and see if
the similar colors are plotted together, if so , I would have a pattern on
time easily identifiable on 2 dimensions.

Let me give an hypothetical case to you.

mat5 <- matrix(rnorm(2000), ,4) #I have a matrix
mat5
seq<-seq(1, 50000, by = 100) # I have a time sequence of 500 dates ranging
from 50000 to 1
seq

rownames(mat5) <- c(seq ) # making ages the row names of the matrix

library("vegan")
test.pca<-rda(mat5) # Ordination (PCA)

plot(test.pca, scaling=-3) # In this plot I would like to have the old ages
ranging from red (age 50000) to purple (age 1)

Would that be possible??

Thank you all for any help

Hi Jackson,
One way to assign colors to values is:

library(plotrix)
ages<-seq(1, 50000, by = 100)
agecol<-color.scale(ages,extremes=c("purple","red"))

Then just use "agecol" for your point colors.

Hi Jackson,
I'll take a wild guess at "What is wrong?". You only got one end of
the color vector, probably the purple end. As my recollection of
principal components analysis is of a data reduction method, you
probably have a lot fewer than 500 points on your plot. If you only
have, say, 50 values to plot, you will only use up 50 colors. If this
is a good guess, you will have to link the colors to the values you
are plotting, not the original values. I have very little idea of what
either set of values is like, but you may be able to work it out.

Subject: [R] Quantmod - modify decimal places
Message-ID: <CA+r16mzPRiqkAHhaJ1JGPAeHcwLAc=acK7RFvDKstdfQ4uZ4PA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Apologies if this has already been asked and answered or if I've labelled
the subject incorrectly but I can't find a solution using the search
function for this group; the vignette documentation for quantmod or general
google searches.

I'm attempting to use quantmod to download foreign currency exchange
rates.  I'm using the call "getFX" however the output results are always
restricted to 4 decimal places.  Generally this is fine but when comparing
developing and mature economies this can lead to no answer being returned
due to how weak a specific currency is (in relative terms).

For example, compare the following two results for converting USD to
Vietnamese Dong (VND):

a)      *1/getFX("USD/VND",from="2016-05-22",to ="2016-05-22", source =
"oanda", auto.assign=FALSE)*

 This yields?

                USD.VND

2016-05-22 4.473272e-05

 However my preferred call would be:

 b)*      getFX("VND/USD",from="2016-05-22",to ="2016-05-22", source =
"oanda", auto.assign=FALSE)*

 However this yields a zero result:

VND.USD

2016-05-22       0


which is clearly wrong.


I've tried various things including trying to invoke options (digits = 10)
at the start of the script, and even within the getFX wrapper as an extra
argument, but it doesn't work.  I can of course run select cross currency
rates and invert the results, but that is pretty awkward and it feels like
there ought to be a smarter and simpler solution.

Any help greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Dave

Subject: [R] Course: Introduction to Zero Inflated Models
Message-ID: <fe1840c4-d966-a6e9-186b-ae7e07ed9f2e@highstat.com>

There are places available on the following course:


Course: Introduction to Zero Inflated Models (Bayesian and frequentist 
approaches)

When: 13-17 June 2016

Where: Australian Institute of Marine Science, Perth, Australia

Course website: http://highstat.com/statscourse.htm

Course flyer: http://highstat.com/Courses/Flyers/Flyer2016_06Perth_ZI_V2.pdf

Keywords: Zero inflated count data. Zero inflated continuous data. 
Dependency. ZIP and ZAP models. Zero inflated GLMMs with random effects. 
Bayesian statistics, MCMC and JAGS. lme4, glmmADMB, JAGS. Overdispersion 
and solutions. Bayesian model selection.

Description: Suppose you want to study hippos and the effect of habitat 
variables on their distribution. When sampling, you may count zero 
hippos at many sites, potentially resulting in overdispersed Poisson 
GLMs.  In such cases zero inflated models can be applied. During the 
course several case studies are presented, in which the statistical 
theory for zero inflated models is integrated with applied analyses in a 
clear and understandable manner. Zero inflated models consist of two 
integrated GLMs and therefore we will start with a revision of GLM. Zero 
inflated GLMMs for nested data (repeated measurements, short time 
series, clustered data, etc.) are discussed in the second part of the 
course. We will focus on zero inflated count data, and zero inflated 
continuous data.

Hi all,
I have the following df:


    $ Protocol       : Factor w/ 48 levels "DP FS QTSE SAG",..: 2 3 43 42 31 36 37 30 28 5 ...
    
    $ Speed         : chr  "SLOW" "SLOW" "SLOW" "VerySLOW" ...
How can I get the most frequent Protocol when Speed is "SLOW"?
Thanks for any help!
Elahe

Dear UserRs,

I have a little problem creating a file connection when working in parallel
(see the reproducable script below).
I am sure this is something obvious,
Can you enlighten me ?

Thanks,

Arnaud



# This part works
#----------------
cat("This is a test file" , file={f <- tempfile()})
con <- file(f, "rt")


# Doing what I think is the same thing gives an error message when executed
in parallel

library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(2)

## Exporting the object f into the cluster

  clusterExport(cl, "f")
  clusterEvalQ(cl[1], con <- file(f[[1]], "rt"))
   #Error in checkForRemoteErrors(lapply(cl, recvResult)) :
   # one node produced an error: cannot open the connection


## Creating the object f into the cluster

  clusterEvalQ(cl[1],cat("This is a test file" , file={f <- tempfile()}))

Hello,

Maybe the following (untested).

table(df$Protocol[df$Speed == "SLOW"])

Hope this helps,

Hi folks,

I am wondering if it is really possible via some R code which shall do
the following

1. Login to a Gmail account (account name and password will be provided to R)
2. Search for all mails which has a word "ABCD" in the mail body
3. Download all the attachments (if available) which will hit the criteria #2


Am not sure if above is too ambitious, however will really appreciate
if R can do this.

Thanks for your time

Hello Experts,

I am trying to scrap data from Google news for a particular topic using XML
and Curl Package of R. I am able to extract the summary part of the news
through *XPath* but in a similar way, I am trying to extract title and
Links of news which is not working.Please note this work is just for POC
purpose and I would make maximum of 500 requests per day so that Google TOS
remains intact.


library(XML)

library(RCurl)

getGoogleURL <- function(search.term, domain = '.co.in', quotes=TRUE)

{

  search.term <- gsub(' ', '%20', search.term)

  if(quotes) search.term <- paste('%22', search.term, '%22', sep='')

  getGoogleURL <- paste('http://www.google', domain,
'/search?hl=en&gl=in&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=',search.term, sep='')

}

search.term <- "IPL 2016"

quotes <- "FALSE"

search.url <- getGoogleURL(search.term=search.term, quotes=quotes)

getGoogleSummary <- function(google.url) {

  doc <- getURL(google.url, httpheader = c("User-Agent" = "R(2.10.0)"))

  html <- htmlTreeParse(doc, useInternalNodes = TRUE, error=function(...){})

}

*#Problem is with this part of code*

getGoogleTitle <- function(google.url) {

  doc <- getURL(google.url, httpheader = c("User-Agent" = "R(2.10.0)"))

  html <- htmlTreeParse(doc, useInternalNodes = TRUE, error=function(...){})

 * nodes <- getNodeSet(html, "//a[@class='l _HId']")*

  return(sapply(nodes, function(x) x <- xmlValue(x)))

}

Kindly help me to understand where I am getting wrong so that I can rectify
the code and get the correct output.

Thank you.

Hi All,

I need to create a data frame from scratch and fill variables created on the fly with values. What I have so far:

-- schnipp --

# Example dataset
gene <- c("ENSG00000208234","ENSG00000199674","ENSG00000221622","ENSG00000207604", 
  "ENSG00000207431","ENSG00000221312","ENSG00134940305","ENSG00394039490",
  "ENSG09943004048")
hsap <- c(0,0,0, 0, 0, 0, 1,1, 1)
mmul <- c(NA,2 ,3, NA, 2, 1 , NA,2, NA)
mmus <- c(NA,2 ,NA, NA, NA, 2 , NA,3, 1)
rnor <- c(NA,2 ,NA, 1 , NA, 3 , NA,NA, 2)
cfam <- c(NA,2,NA, 2, 1, 2, 2,NA, NA)

ds_example <- data.frame(gene, hsap, mmul, mmus, rnor, cfam)
ds_example$gene <- as.character(ds_example$gene)

t_count_na <- function(dataset,
                       variables = "all")
  # credit: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4862178/remove-rows-with-nas-in-data-frame
  {
  ds_na <- data.frame()
  # if variables = "all" create character vector of variable names
  if (variables == "all") {
    variable_list <- dimnames(dataset)[[ 2 ]] 
  }
  # if a character vector with variable names is given
  # to run the function on a defined set of selected variables
  else {
    variable_list <- variables
  }
  
  for (var in variable_list) {
    new_name <- paste0("na_", var)
    ds_na[[ new_name ]] <- as.data.frame(is.na(dataset[[ var ]]))
  }
  
  ds_na[[ "na_count" ]] <- rowSums(ds_na)
  return(ds_na)
}

test <- t_count_na(dataset = ds_example, variables = c("mmul", "mmus"))

-- schnipp --

gives:

 Error in `[[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, new_name, value = list(`is.na(dataset[[var]])` = c(TRUE,  : 
  replacement has 9 rows, data has 0 In addition: Warning message:
In if (variables == "all") { :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

My goal is to create a dataset from scratch on the fly which has the same amount of variables as the dataset ds_example plus a single variable storing the amount of NA's in a row for the given variables. This is the basis for a decious which cases to keep and which to drop.

I do not want to alter the base dataset like ds_example in the first place nor do I want to make a copy of the existing dataset due to memory allocation. The function shall also work with big data, e. g. datasets with more than 1 GB memory consumption.

I also do not want the newly created variables to be stored in the original data frame. They shall be separate.

A former similar solution worked:
http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Creating-variables-on-the-fly-td4720034.html

Why doesn't this one?

How do I create the variables within the data frame if the data frame is empty?

Kind regards

Georg Maubach

I would probably write the function something like this:


t_count_na <- function(dataset,
                       variables = "all") {
  if (identical(variables, "all")) {
    variable_list <- names(dataset)
  }  else {
    variable_list <- variables
  }  
  apply(dataset[,variable_list], 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
}


Hope this is helpful,

Subject: [R] identify duplicate entries in data frame and calculate mean
Message-ID: <3e8793e6-1bae-fe74-e48b-f2a5b18dfc54@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu>

I have a data frame with 10 columns.
In the last column is an alphaneumaric identifier.
For most rows, this alphaneumaric identifier is unique to the file, 
however some of these alphanemeric idenitifiers occur in duplicate, 
triplicate or more. When they do occur more than once they are in 
consecutive rows, so when there is a duplicate or triplicate or 
quadruplicate (let's call them multiplicates), they are in consecutive rows.

In column 7 there is an integer number (may or may not be unique. does 
not matter).

I want to identify each multiple entries (multiplicates) occurring in 
column 10 and then for each multiplicate calculate the mean of the 
integers column 7.

As an example, I will show just two columns:
Length  Identifier
321     A234
350     A234
340     A234
180     B123
198     B225

What I want to do (in the above example) is collapse all the A234's and 
report the mean to get this:
Length  Identifier
337     A234
180     B123
198     B225

You have several  options.  

1.  You could use the aggregate function.  If your data frame is called DF, you could do something like

with(DF, aggregate(Length, list(Identifier), mean))

2.  You could use the dplyr package like this

library(dplyr)
summarize(group_by(DF, Identifier), mean(Length))


Hope this is helpful,

Thank you very much, Tom.
This gets me thinking in the right direction.
One thing I should have mentioned that I did not is that the number of 
rows in the data frame will be a little over 40,000 rows.

Don't see that as being a big problem. If your data grows then dplyr
supports connections to external databases. Alternately if you just want a
mean, most databases can do that directly in SQL.

Thanks, Tom.  I was making a mistake looking at your example and that's 
what my problem was.

Cool answer, works great. Thank you very much.

You are treating this as if R were a macro processor, which it's not. The only function that lets you pull in a data-object from the store of named objects using a character vector is `get`, so perhaps:

get( sprintf("Samples_%s.txt", 1) )$V1

And if you were considering the next step of hoping to pass a computed item to `$`, then forget that as well, and learn to use `[`.

It is not clear (at least to me) what your actual task is.  But, if Samples_1.txt is the actual name of a data frame that exists in memory (and not a filename), then you need to wrap the sprintf() in a get() function.

get(sprintf("Samples_%s.txt", 1))$V1

I am no expert  on "computing on the language" in R, but I can't help but think you are going about your task in the wrong way.  If you provide more detail about what you are trying to do, someone will probably be able to provide you a solution where you don't need to do it this way.


Hope this is helpful,

Hi Beatriz,
I'll guess that you have a number of files with names like this:

Samples_1.txt
Samples_2.txt
...

Each one can be read with a function like read.table and will return a
data frame with default names (V1, V2, ...). You then want to extract
the first element (column) of the data frame. If I'm correct, try
this:

V1s<-list()
# nfiles is the number of files you want to read
for(i in 1:nfiles) {
 filename<-paste("Samples_",i,".txt,sep="")
 # you will probably have to add the appropriate arguments to read.table
 V1s[[i]]<-read.table(filename)$V1
}

The list V1s should contain the first columns of all the data frames read.

Jim

Hi,

what is exactly mixed model analysis in R?
could someone give me a better description.


Thank you,
Neny

This has nothing to do with R, per se. This is a statistical issue. You
need to work with a statistician, as your statistical background is
inadequate (google "mixed effects models") if you really need this.

Cheers,
Bert

What you are doing wrong is both trying yourself and asking others to
violate Google's Terms of Service and (amongst other things) get your
IP banned along with anyone who aids you (or worse). Please don't.
Just because something can be done does not mean it should be done.

I would probably write the function something like this:


t_count_na <- function(dataset,
                       variables = "all") {
  if (identical(variables, "all")) {
    variable_list <- names(dataset)
  }  else {
    variable_list <- variables
  } 
  apply(dataset[,variable_list], 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
}


Hope this is helpful,

Could also use which.max to get the particular item: ...
tprot <- table(df$Protocol[df$Speed == "SLOW"])
tprot[which.max(tprot)]

Message-ID: <3E1C08ABE98D2946977745E01A1A376F0173C481@BANURBNA05.e2k.ad.ge.com>

Hi All,

Request your help.

We are trying to connect to hive from R using Rstudio. Its a kerberos secured cluster. Code snippet is below.

==============

library(rJava)
library(RJDBC)

cp = c("/usr/hdp/2.3.2.0-2950/hive/lib/hive-jdbc.jar","/usr/hdp/2.3.2.0-2950/hadoop/lib/hadoop-common-2.7.1.2.3.2.0-2950.jar")
.jinit(classpath=cp)

drv <- JDBC("org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver",classPath = list.files("/usr/hdp/2.3.2.0-2950/hadoop/lib",pattern="jar$",full.names=T, recursive = TRUE),identifier.quote="`")

conn <- dbConnect(drv, "jdbc:hive2://host.node1.com:10000/default;principal=hive/shost.node1.com at node1.com<mailto:shost.node1.com at node1.com>", "", "")

show_databases <- dbGetQuery(conn, "show databases")

show_databases

==============

But we are getting the below error

Error in .jcall(drv at jdrv, "Ljava/sql/Connection;", "connect", as.character(url)[1],  :
  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation

What are we missing here? A kerberos ticket is there in place. Shall we usekerberos  keytab inside R code? What is the function for ir. Also which hadoop libraries should we import for R and hive interaction?



Thanks & Regards,

Anoop Kumar K M

Subject: [R] Reduce does not work with data.table?
Message-ID: <BLU437-SMTP106ED097DCFEE035776C6A5E9400@phx.gbl>

Reduce is failing when applied to a list of elements of class 
data.table. Perhaps this is a bug?

Example:

library(data.table)

dt1 <- data.table(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)
dt2 <- data.table(x = 4:6, y = 1:3)
dt3 <- data.table(x = 0:-2, y = 0:-2)

# This works fine
dt1 + dt2 + dt2
#    x y
# 1: 5 5
# 2: 6 6
# 3: 7 7

# But:
dt_list <- list(dt1, dt2, dt3)
Reduce("+", dt_list)
# Error in f(init, x[[i]]) : non-numeric argument to binary operator
# In addition: Warning message:
# In Reduce("+", dt_list) :
#   Incompatible methods ("Ops.data.frame", "Ops.data.table") for "+"

If I use data.frame instead of data.table, Reduce works properly.

Message-ID: <CAE2FW2kA0qgLqhqYC1=zMfRra6ysYYEA4yEBSwk0gMHpvFs_dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am searching for some toy models in R.  My goal is do to model checking.

For example,

My data come from statistical model N(5, 2), with n=100, call this model_1
Then, I add bias to that data with N(3, 1), with n=100, call this model_2

Ultimately, I want to see model_1+ model_2 gives good prediction or perhaps
parameter estimation.

I think this is a pretty standard statistical analysis problem?

How do people on this list deal with it?  Any suggestions?

Thank you,

Mike

This is a design feature of data.table objects, which don't conform to the normal functional programming paradigm that R is usually designed to adhere to and which Reduce expects. Specifically, they normally modify in-place rather than leaving the original object alone. 

In short, don't do that. Read more about how data.tables work. Their benefits come with distinct disadvantages that you need to be very clear about or you will get into trouble like this regularly.

Do you mean you have data from N(5,2) that has had data from N(3,1) added to it, or that you have two different sets of data?
Or do you mean that you want to know how to generate such data?

> Ultimately, I want to see model_1+ model_2 gives good prediction 
If you generate random data correctly following a model, the model will indeed predict the data pretty well. But under those circumstances it seems redundant to ask the question. Were you thinking of fitting a (possibly different) model to the data at some point ?  If so, what model would you want to fit? And what would you want to predict from it?

What parameters do you want to estimate?

Unclear on that at present. See above.

I generate toy data from N(5,2). X input will be the same for model_1 and
model_2, say, seq(-3, 3, by=0.01).

I only use model_1, model_2 for data generation.  I am using machine
learning methods for estimation and prediction to see if the method is good
and robust.  Then, check performance by comparing results with the known
model_1 and model_2.

Subject: [R] mixed models
Message-ID: <CABPq8JN974cVTJvRT-+hHigPERV+-uVzzNq6OCZuqpHB4q5xgw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings R community,

My aim is to analyze a mixed-effects model with temporal pseudo-replication
(repeated measures on the same experimental unit) using ?nlme?.  However,
my code returns the error message ?Error in na.fail.default?, even though
the data frame does not contain missing values. My code is below, and the
data file is attached as ?Eboni2.txt.

library("nlme")

str(Eboni2)

head(Eboni2)

model1 <- lme(preDawn ~ Irrigation, random=~season_order|treeNo,
data=Eboni2)

I am genuinely confused.  Hope someone can help.

Best regards,

James F. Henson

You forgot to show the commands to us that you used to read the data in with (your example is not "reproducible"). This step can make all the difference in the world as to whether your analysis commands will work or not.

Subject: [R]  strange error
Message-ID: <873274c8eb88201a0f8babc05ca4c3fd@email.freenet.de>

Hello everyone,
almost every time I try to plot something R gives me the following mistake:
Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large
One example would be, when I tried to run a function, somebody published to create a Lorenz Attractor:
?
parameters <- c(s = 10, r = 28, b = 8/3) state <- c(X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 1)
Lorenz <- function(t, state, parameters) {   with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {     dX <- s * (Y - X)     dY <- X * (r - Z) - Y     dZ <- X * Y - b * Z     list(c(dX, dY, dZ))   }) }
times <- seq(0, 50, by = 0.01) library(deSolve) out <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
par(oma = c(0, 0, 3, 0)) plot(out, xlab = "time", ylab = "-") plot(out[, "Y"], out[, "Z"], pch = ".", type = "l") mtext(outer = TRUE, side = 3, "Lorenz model", cex = 1.5)
?
It turns out to be really problematic, because there are barely functions I can plot.
My version of RStudio is R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10) -- "Wooden Christmas Tree" and my computer uses Windows 8.1.
Would it be possible to avoid the problem by using Windows 10?
Or is there anything else I can do?
?
Thank you in advance,
Alice de Sampaio Kalkuhl

This is an RStudio problem, not an R problem.  One solution is to make 
the "Plots" pane bigger.  There may be others -- you'll have to contact 
RStudio for help with it.

It may not be the problem, but with RStudio this error pops up when
the area reserved for plotting is too small. Typically this area is in
the right hand column, if you have this minimised (perhaps to maximise
space for typing) you will hit this problem. Try making it bigger.

Edit: Just ran your code, the problem is with the line
par(oma = c(0, 0, 3, 0))

This sets the plot outer margins, my guess is that you have used this
command then managed to save the settings to your default environment.
Changing to:

par(oma = c(1, 4, 3, 4))


which I think is the default, fixes the code on my system

Subject: [R] svymean in multistage desing
Message-ID: <CAEJjatR+BUNyO6Jv87hb61MSBXCgomJBtyrmC_19MFiTGh6dJw@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for your attention. I have been using  your R library, survey, I
made an example for two stage sampling  SI ? SI, an estimate the total and
the mean,  (the point estimation y de SE)

and also, I remaking the estimation.





For the total, point estimation and estimation of the variance, we have
exactly the same number. But for the mean, the estimated sample variance I
found different number.



I have been using  the formula   8.6.6 of S?rdall,  -Model Assisted Survey
Sampling-.  That for the  case of  Simple Random sample without replacement
is equal, to the Taylor approximation for two stage sample, Example 5.6.3
of S?rdall,  -Model Assisted Survey Sampling-













Can you please help me telling me which one is the formula that function
svymean or svratio are using.



I copy the code.

Please keep the mailing list in the loop by using reply-all.

I don't think there is a requirement that the number of levels is equal, but there may be problems if you don't have the minimum number of records corresponding to each combination of levels specified in your model. 

You can change the csv extension to txt and attach for the mailing list. Or, better yet, you can use the dput function to embed the data directly in your sample code. 

Also,  please learn to post plain text email to avoid corruption of R code by the HTML formatting.

Subject: [R] Computing means of multiple variables based on a condition
Message-ID: <B203F983-BD0A-4E3F-9D08-A08E27F5136C@gmail.com>

I have a large dataset, a sample of which is:

a<- c(?A?, ?B?,?A?, ?B?,?A?, ?B?,?A?, ?B?,?A?, ?B?)
b <-c(15, 35, 20,  99, 75, 64, 33, 78, 45, 20)
c<- c( 111, 234, 456, 876, 246, 662, 345, 480, 512, 179)
d<- c(1.1, 3.2, 14.2, 8.7, 12.5, 5.9, 8.3, 6.0, 2.9, 9.3) 

df <- data.frame(a,b,c,d)

I?m trying to construct a data frame that shows the means of c & b based on the condition of d and grouped by a.

I want to create the data frame below, then use ggplot2 to create a line plot of b at various conditions of d.

I can compute the grouped means (d>=2, d>=4, etc.) one at a time using dplyr but haven?t figured out how to put them all together or put them in one data frame.

I?d rather not use a loop and am relatively new to R.  Is there a way i can use tapply and set it to the conditions above so that I can create the df below?


        condition    mean(b)     mean(c)    
A        d>=2          ____         _____
B        d>=2          ____         _____
A        d>=4          ____         _____
B        d>=4         ____         _____

Just to be clear, do you really want your 'condition' groups to be be
subsets
of one another?  Most (all?) of the *ply functions assume you want
non-overlapping groups so they do a split-summarize-combine sequence.
You would have to replace the split part of that.

Alice,

Have you tried running the code in R in a terminal?  If the error
persists, then this may be the right place to ask for help.  If it is
specific to R Studio, then you need to ask them.

These will be overlapping subgroups from the same data frame.  For example, d<=2 will have length=9, d<=4 will have length=7, etc.

Thank you for including some sample data, but I have to ask that you 
please invest some time in learning how to edit your code in a text editor 
and to post in plain text. The quote marks in your example were "curly", 
which R does not understand. There are other ways in which HTML email 
leads to corruption on this mailing list as well, so you will save 
everyone numerous headaches by investing this time sooner rather than 
later.

The type of operation you are looking for is referred to as an "outer 
join" in SQL nomenclature, and it is intrinsically slow because the only 
way to accomplish it is computationally equivalent to a for loop that 
successively applies each minimum "d" value to your whole data set.

Having said that, you can accomplish this in the "dplyr" syntax instead of 
using a for loop, if that makes you happy, but it is not really any 
"better" than a for loop (and some people might consider it misleading 
to drape a for loop in such fancy syntax):

DF <- data.frame( a = c( "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B" )
                 , b = c( 15, 35, 20,  99, 75, 64, 33, 78, 45, 20 )
                 , c = c( 111, 234, 456, 876, 246, 662, 345, 480, 512, 179 )
                 , d = c( 1.1, 3.2, 14.2, 8.7, 12.5, 5.9, 8.3, 6.0, 2.9, 9.3 )
                 , stringsAsFactors = FALSE
                 )
passes <- data.frame( dmin = c( 2, 4, 6 ) )

library(dplyr)

DF2 <- (   passes
        %>% rowwise
        %>% do({ # run once for each row in "passes"
             dmin <- .$dmin # dot here refers to row of
                            # "passes" data frame
             (   DF
             %>% filter( d >= dmin )
             %>% group_by( a )
             %>% summarise( meanb = mean( b )
                          , meanc = mean( c )
                          )
             %>% mutate( condition = paste0( "d>=", dmin ) )
             )
            })
        %>% select( a, condition, meanb, meanc )
        %>% as.data.frame
        )

Another option would be to convert the data into a long format and add
columns for each condition.

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
DF %>%

Subject: [R] Shaded areas in R
Message-ID: <CAJAnTBXtLMADaak8JyPcXcJ3WLPPkczyZ+ktvAaXUrDr5p-T4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working with R language, and plotting some parameters over time. I need
to draw a shaded area under the curve of eacj parameter.

For that, I might use the polygon (x,y) function, assigning coordinates
(x,y) to each vertex of my polygon. To do so, "x" and "y" must be vectors
with numerical values, but since my x-axis is a time series, I cannot
assing a numerical value to my "x" coordinate, because time variable is a
"character" variable.

Is there any option to use the function polygin (x,y) in this case, or any
other function that allows me to draw a shaded area under the curve on a
time series basis?

Thank you in advance for your help

Best regards

?scar

Subject: [R] Segmentation Fault with large dataframes and packages using
	rJava
Message-ID: <5746C695.7000902@biotec.tu-dresden.de>

Dear all,

I have been trying to perform machine learning/feature selection tasks 
in R using various packages (e.g. mlr and FSelector).
However, when giving larger data frames as input for the functions, I 
get a segmentation fault (memory not mapped).

This happened first when using the mlr benchmark function with 
dataframes in the order of 200 rows x 10,000 columns (all integer values).

I prepared a minimal working example where I get a segmentation fault 
trying to calculate the information gain with FSelector package.

require("FSelector")
# Random dataframe 200 rows * 25,000 cols
large.df <- data.frame(replicate(25000,sample(0:1,200,rep=TRUE)))
weights <- information.gain(X24978~., large.df)
print(weights)


I am using R version 3.3.0 64-bit on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS with FSelector 
v0.20 and rJava v0.9.8 on a machine with 32 core Intel i7 and 250 GB 
Ram. Java is OpenJDK 1.7 74bit.

I would highly appreciate if you could give me any hint on how to solve 
the problem.

Best
ssalentin

Hi ?scar,

Not really sure what you mean by the time variable being a "character"
vector. Unless you are plotting a barchart or boxplot (or similar), I
don't this this makes sense. If you can post a sample of your data,
preferably using the dput() command we can probably help more.

Times and dates just print like characters, they aren't actually 
characters.  For example,

  x <- Sys.Date() + 1:20
  y <- rnorm(20)
  plot(y ~ x)
  polygon(c(x, x[20], x[1]), c(y, 0, 0), col="gray")

It returns a Date object.  The str() function will show you that. But 
Date, POSIXct, and even POSIXlt are supported by many of the graphics 
functions, so you don't need to worry about the conversions.

No, that is not needed.

polygon() does.

You should try things; R won't break.

You should always do that when you pose your question; you should also 
send your questions to R-help, not privately.  I've cc'd my response there.

Subject: [R] data.table exact matching numeric keys
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP1619701079FFE3F304C1F1E9410@phx.gbl>

I have looked over the documentation and did not see an answer to this 
seemingly basic question:

I noticed that if I have a data.table with a key containing numeric 
values, then a close number is considered a match when searching. For 
example,

 > dt[J(a)]
#     certainty probability
# 1: 0.8596491          -1
# 2: 0.8596491          -1

But in fact the two certainty values differ by 5.797585e-13.

Is there a way to only return exact matches, or set the epsilon value 
(to something like machine epsilon)?

Message-ID: <CAHVFrXGTa23vepAzQL7oZA=c5A7CpB-JCPoCQ8s4Q2qhJv-32g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R-users,

I have created a Conditional Tree using the ctree function ( in package
partykit). The data had a factor - the y variable - and a host  of
categorical x-variables.
Now, I want to find the proportion of cases where y = 1 in each of the
terminal nodes.

Is it possible to do so programmatically?


*Tree <- ctree( y~., data = mydata, ctree_control = c(maxdepth = 4))*

Regards,
Preetam

Hi all,
I have the following df and I want to know which Protocols are VeryFast, which are FAST, which are SLOW and also which ones are VerySLOW :

    
  $ Protocol       : Factor w/ 48 levels "DP FS QTSE SAG",..: 5 5 28 5 5 5 7 7 47 5 ...

  $ quant          : Factor w/ 4 levels "FAST","SLOW",..: 2 2 2 4 2 1 1 2 4 

I do the following subset but nothing is changed in my df:


  subdf=subset(df,quant%in%c("VeryFast"))
  subdf$quant=factor(subdf$quant)
and when I get the str(df) again Protocol has 48 levels. Does anyone know how can I get these subsets right?
Thanks for any help!

Subject: [R] Factor Analysis using weights for each variable
Message-ID: <CAHVFrXG8=jTuY0JKXURnX2sXKfFb8rfZT_cPtSNjWWn=ixjHKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R-users,

I have 1020 time series ( each of length 10,000), say, X1,X2,......,X1020
and I want to perform Factor Analysis using 50 factors on their correlation
matrix.

The issue is: for every series, I have a weight, i.e. *the series X_i has a
pre-defined weight of w_i* ( i = 1,2,...., 1020). I want to estimate the
factor loadings and specific variances in the model by optimizing the
likelihood function (assuming multivariate normality, as usual).
Is it possible to estimate the model parameters using the weights for each
time series variable in the objective function?

One comment here - For computational purposes or otherwise, it is *ok to
 change my objective function* (instead of taking the likelihood function,
may be something like minimizing the weighted sum of squared specific
variances for the variables would make sense).

Any help with this will be really appreciated.

Regards,
Preetam

Thanks for your answers

I'm going to share my script and my database in an excel file, where you
can check the kind of graph I would like to make (see attached document,
you can find it in Sheet1. Sheet 3 is the one that I used in .csv format to
work with in R).

Script:

# HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION ANALYSIS FOR EVENTS: JULY 9TH AND SEPT 11TH

# Event 20. July 9th, 2015

setwd("C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\MSc Thesis - INIRENA\\R\\Downloads")
dir()

  # Ev20HS: P event 20. Hydrograph separation
Ev20HS <- read.table("Event20_Hydrograph_Separation.txt", skip=4,
header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
as.data.frame(Ev20HP)
colnames(Ev20HS)<- c("Date","Hour","P", "Qt", "St2H", "P2H", "GW2H",
"St18O", "P18O", "GW18O",
                     "Qold2H", "Qnew2H", "%old2H", "%new2H", "Qold18O",
"Qnew18O", "%old18O", "%new18O")
paste(Ev20HS$Date, Ev20HS$Hour)
Ev20HS$date.time <- paste(Ev20HS$Date, Ev20HS$Hour)
as.POSIXct(Ev20HS$date.time, format="%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S", tz="-7")
Ev20HS$date.time <- as.POSIXct(Ev20HS$date.time, format="%Y/%m/%d
%H:%M:%S", tz="-7")

par(mar=c(4, 4, 4, 4))
plot(Ev20HS$date.time, Ev20HS$P, type="h", axes= FALSE, col="cadetblue4",
ylim=c(10,0),
     lwd=2, xlab= "Hour", xline= 1.5, ylab = " ")
axis (4, lwd= 1)
mtext (4, line=2, text="P (mm)")
par(new=T)
plot(Ev20HS$date.time, Ev20HS$Qt, type="l", col="deepskyblue", lwd=2,
ylim=c(0,0.02), xlab= " ", ylab = " ")
axis (2, lwd= 1)
mtext (2, line=2.25, text="Q (mm/10min)")
par(new=T)
plot(Ev20HS$date.time, Ev20HS$Qold2H, type="l", axes= FALSE, col="sienna3",
lwd=2, ylim=c(0,0.02), xlab= " ", ylab = " ")
cord.x <- c(7, 7, 13, 13)
cord.y <- c(0.00223742, 0.00238599, 0.01043445, 0.00970288)
polygon(cord.x, cord.y, col="steelblue3")


I want to plot in the same graph:

a) Precipitation (P) as a barplot (downwards) --> DONE
b) Total discharge in Stream (Qt) --> DONE
c) Discharge of groundwater, i.e. old component (Qold2H) --> The space
between Qt and Qold2H needs to be shaded with one colour, and the space
between Qold2H and x-axes needs to be shaded as well.


Another question, is there any option to make these curves smoother? I
don't really like those ugly peaks.

Subject: [R] Scale y-labels based on a value with 'lattice'
Message-ID: <bf9a8711-f098-cf66-6cfd-55b3bee9e9c7@pp.inet.fi>

Dear R-helpers!

I have a data frame storing data for word co-occurrences, average 
distances and co-occurence frequency:

       Group.1    Group.2     x Freq
1 deutschland  achtziger  2.00    1
2 deutschland        alt  1.25    4
3 deutschland     anfang -2.00    1
4 deutschland    ansehen  1.00    2
5 deutschland     arbeit  0.50    2
6 deutschland arbeitslos -2.00    1

Now I want to plot a lattice 'dotplot' with the formula 'Group.2~x'. 
This works fine.

However, I would like to scale the y-label (based on 'Group.2' according 
the 'Freq' value using a log-scaled value (log(Freq+.5)). In other 
words: the higher the 'Freq' value of a term, the bigger its label 
should be printed in my dotplot.

The problem is that I cannot figure out how to tell lattice to scale 
each y-label with according 'Freq' value. I am quite sure I should build 
a function for scales=list(y=...), but I don't know how to it.

Many thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
Kimmo Elo

Hello,

Don't use subset, use indexing.

subdf <- df[df$quant %in% "VeryFast", ]

By the way, instead of %in% you can use ==, since you're interested in  
just one value of quant.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear all,


I have downloaded the NUTS 2 level data from

#library(?SmarterPoland?)
library(fields)

# Download Administrative Level data from EuroStat
temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")

unzip(temp)

# Read data
EU_NUTS <- readOGR(dsn = "./NUTS_2010_60M_SH/data", layer =
"NUTS_RG_60M_2010")

# Subset NUTS 2 level data
map_nuts2 <- subset(EU_NUTS, STAT_LEVL_ == 2)

I also have data for a variable by coordinates, which looks like this:

structure(list(LON = c(-125.25, -124.75, -124.25, -124.25, -124.25,
-124.25), LAT = c(49.75, 49.25, 42.75, 43.25, 48.75, 49.25),

I would like to match the coordinates to their corresponding NUTS 2 region

You did not change df$quant - you made a new object called 'subdf'
containing a column called 'quant' that had only one level.  Changing
subdf has no effect on df.

Perhaps the
  over()
function in the sp package.

(in which case, R-sig-geo might be a better place to ask).

You want the number of days between dates?
Does this do the trick?

dts <- Sys.Date()+ c(1,2,3,5,6,9)
dts[-1] - dts[-length(dts)]

Time differences in days
[1] 1 1 2 1 3

What about just

diff( dts )

or

as.numeric( diff( dts ), units="days" )

?

Hi

If you want to change the cex of the labels see

library(lattice)
 ?yscale.components.default

Possibly an easier way is to size the symbols

I will use Jims data.frame to plot with lattice
dotplot(Group.2 ~ x, data = kedf, 
                 scales = list(y = list(labels = kedf[,"Group2"], cex = = kedf[,"Freq"]))) 

 If you want to magnify the size of the symbol according to Freq

dotplot(Group.2 ~ x, data = kedf, 
                cex = kedf[,"Freq"])

or with modifications
dotplot(Group.2 ~ x, data = kedf, 
                col = "black",
               pch = 15,
                cex = kedf[,"Freq"])

If you wanted to go further

dotplot(Group.2 ~ x, data = kedf,
        par.settings = list(dot.symbol = list(col = "black",
                                              pch = 15)  ),
        cex = kedf[,"Freq"])

without further work cex will not work as it is in par settings

Subject: [R] Scale y-labels based on a value with 'lattice'

Dear R-helpers!

I have a data frame storing data for word co-occurrences, average 
distances and co-occurence frequency:

       Group.1    Group.2     x Freq
1 deutschland  achtziger  2.00    1
2 deutschland        alt  1.25    4
3 deutschland     anfang -2.00    1
4 deutschland    ansehen  1.00    2
5 deutschland     arbeit  0.50    2
6 deutschland arbeitslos -2.00    1

Now I want to plot a lattice 'dotplot' with the formula 'Group.2~x'. 
This works fine.

However, I would like to scale the y-label (based on 'Group.2' according 
the 'Freq' value using a log-scaled value (log(Freq+.5)). In other 
words: the higher the 'Freq' value of a term, the bigger its label 
should be printed in my dotplot.

The problem is that I cannot figure out how to tell lattice to scale 
each y-label with according 'Freq' value. I am quite sure I should build 
a function for scales=list(y=...), but I don't know how to it.

Many thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
Kimmo Elo

Subject: [R] Getting Rid of NaN in ts Object
Message-ID: <20160527101432.GA3282@localhost.localdomain>

Dear All,
I am sure the answer is a one liner, but I am banging my head against
the wall and googling here and there has not helped much.
Consider the following time series

tt<-structure(c(NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN,
NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, 1133.09, 1155.77, 1179.12,
1182.85, 1133.43, 1103.36, 1081.19, 1058.55, 1056.95, 1059.13,
1018.18, 920.62, 865.99, 856.29, 841.58, 857.7, 852.71, 890.76
), .Tsp = c(1980, 2015, 1), class = "ts")


where the NaN do *not* occur internally. How can I automatically get
rid of them and adjust the start and end year of the time series
accordingly?
Many thanks

Lorenzo

Also, subsetting a factor _intentionally_ does not change the number of levels. Example:
f <- factor(sample(letters[1:3], 30, replace=TRUE))
f[1]  #One element, still three levels

If you want to drop levels, use droplevels() either on the factor or on the subset of your data frame. Example: 
droplevels(f[1]) #One element, only one level


Also worth noting that df is a function.
 > df <- data.frame(quant=factor(letters))
looks very like you're assigning a data frame to the function 'df' (density for the F distribution)
It doesn't, because R is clever. But it's really not good practice to use common function names as variable names. Too much potential for confusion.

Hi Lorenzo,

Try:

tt[is.nan(tt)] <- NA
tt <- na.omit(tt)

Best,

Subject: [R] Package index.html pages in repository
Message-ID: <CAFDswJs8A_0SUY7kfjLZZxStvyT-dAbS3srE6Df2yQaQ=yReEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am hosting a small repository (of partly non-public repositories) and was
wondering if it is possible to create the package-index page on CRAN (e.g.
here for drat https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/drat/drat.pdf)

automatically somehow out of an existing repo (i.e. create the package from
the descriptions, extract the manual, extract the vignette, link them etc.).

Thanks!

Holger

That's the data Oanda provides via the URL quantmod::getSymbols.oanda
uses. Look for yourself:

http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/download?quote_currency=VND&end_date=2016-05-22&start_date=2016-05-22&period=daily&display=absolute&rate=0&data_range=d7&price=mid&view=table&base_currency_0=USD&base_currency_1=&base_currency_2=&base_currency_3=&base_currency_4=&download=csv

In case it's not clear from what I said above, there's nothing you can

Subject: [R] Sample selection using multiple logit or similar
Message-ID: <5626172f-21f2-4298-228b-fc740c4441d7@unc.edu>

Greetings-

I am seeking to fit a model using Heckman-style selection; however the 
wrinkle is that the selection is into multiple categories, not a binary 
in/out. In this case, selection is into the type of higher-education 
institution a student attended; the goal is to estimate post-graduation 
outcomes while correcting for selection into universities.

There is an old Stata file, svyselmlog, that may or may not solve this 
problem in stata. Any guidance or pointers toward solving it in R would 
be most welcome.

Thanks-
Andy Perrin

Subject: [R] Fitting quantile (or cdf?) function to data with specified
 percentiles
Message-ID: <COL125-W15DB9E7C88C717CDDF5B0AF420@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I hope you can help me. In class, we were given an Excel worksheet with specified formulas that take the total score from a survey (or from a specific section) and convert it to a percentage, according to a table that assigns scores to a percentile. Since the formulas are too long and complicated (some have been input by hand) I figured we could fit the data with a function with some parameters. I plotted the table and sure it resembled a more-or-less symmetrical quantile function, and I wanted to use R to find a curve that fittted the data. Here it is:

percentile <- c(0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05,
0.05, 0.05, 0.10, 0.10, 0.15, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50,
0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.95, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99,
0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99)

score <- c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,
45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50)

I looked up the quantreg package, but I didn't know how to use it properly since I don't have the raw data, only the percentiles, and also because what I'm trying to get is the percentile based on the score, not the other way around. Then I tried to fit it using a sigmoid curve (similar to a cdf), using the following code:

require(drc)
model1 <- drm(percentile ~ score, fct = LL.4())
summary(model1)

But I found another problem, the fitted curve apparently went over 1 on the y axis, something not possible for a cdf. I'd like to know what would be the most appropiate way to do this, and also if it is possible to fit a quantile function with this data, apart from the cdf.

Thank you very much for your help

This gives you tt object as numeric vector. If you want to retain ts properties you can use window, but in this case you have to know in which year you want to start

e.g.
tt <- window(tt, 1998, 2015)

Thanks Ulrik,
But in these examples they want to mark the percentage or frequency of plot variables, in my case I want to mark the bars with a different variable of my df. DO you have any idea?

Hi Elahe,

Based on this and your other questions I think you could benefit from
spending time with tutorials on ggplot and on R in general.

Google should give you plenty and I quickly found this:
http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/ and this:
https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf
R tutorial but others might suit your needs. For the ggplot tutorial I came
across http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html and
http://www.r-bloggers.com/basic-introduction-to-ggplot2/

I have only skimmed the linked pages and it looks like a good starting
point.

Hope this helps
Ulrik

Dear list,

Say I have a data frame

test <- data.frame(C1=c('a,b,c,d'),C2=c('g,h,f'))

I want to replace the commas with semicolons

sub(',',';',test$C1) -> test$C1 will only replace the first comma of a string.

How do I replace them all in one run? Thanks.

You can use gsub() instead of sub()

Thanks Ulrik and Bob for your reply.

gsub worked for one column!

If I want to replace the whole data frame, gsub doesn't seem to work. Any
idea

If your data.frame is a mix you can loop over each column - along the lines
of:

library(plyr)

adply(test, 2, function(x){
if(!is.numeric(x[[1]]){
gsub(",", ";", x[[1]])
}else{
x[[1]]
}
})

Calling factor() on a factor, as the OP did, also drops any unused levels,
as the examples showed.

> str(factor(factor(letters)[11:13]))
 Factor w/ 3 levels "k","l","m": 1 2 3
> str(droplevels(factor(letters)[11:13]))
 Factor w/ 3 levels "k","l","m": 1 2 3

Using droplevels instead of factor does make the intent clearer and
droplevels works on data.frames.

A possible (simple) solution is to use a binomial GLM which guarantees  
fitted values (percentiles) in (0,1):

plot(percentile, score)
o<-glm(percentile~sc, family=binomial)
points(fitted(o), sc, col=2)

You can "predict" percentiles given score via predict.glm()

Greetings Jeff,
You are correct that the unequal number of levels is not the problem.
I revised the data frame so that the number of levels was equal and
the same error message occurred.  The code is below, and the
Eboni2.txt file is attached. This problem baffles me.  I appreciate
any help.
Best regards,
James
 Eboni2 <- read.csv("Eboni2.csv", header = TRUE)

library("nlme")

str(Eboni2)

head(Eboni2)

model1 <- lme(preDawn ~ Irrigation, random=~season_order|treeNo, data=Eboni2)

Subject: [R] Trimming time series to only include complete years
Message-ID: <CAPoqHzrZpb=S6GQRo0O0fszw06pW2_-HKe1MQ34emZANsDJeyQ@mail.gmail.com>

In bulk processing streamflow data available from an online database, I'm
wanting to trim the beginning and end of the time series so that daily data
associated with incomplete "water years" (defined as extending from Oct 1st
to the following September 30th) is trimmed off the beginning and end of
the series.

For a small reproducible example, the time series below starts on
2010-01-01 and ends on 2011-11-05.  So the data between 2010-01-01 and
2010-09-30 and also between 2011-10-01 and 2011-11-05 is not associated
with a complete set of data for their respective water years.  With the
real data, the initial date of collection is arbitrary, could be 1901 or
1938, etc.  Because I'm cycling through potentially thousands of records, I
need help in designing a function that is efficient.

dat <-
data.frame(Date=seq(as.Date("2010-01-01"),as.Date("2011-11-05"),by="day"))
dat$Q <- rnorm(nrow(dat))

dat$wyr <- as.numeric(format(dat$Date,"%Y"))
is.nxt <- as.numeric(format(dat$Date,"%m")) %in% 1:9
dat$wyr[!is.nxt] <- dat$wyr[!is.nxt] + 1


function(dat) {
   ...
   returns a subset of dat such that dat$Date > xxxx-09-30 & dat$Date <
yyyy-10-01
   ...
}

where the years between xxxx-yyyy are "complete" (no missing days).  In the
example above, the returned dat would extend from 2010-10-01 to 2011-09-30

Any offered guidance is very much appreciated.

?Did you see this from ?read.fortran

<quote>

 For a single-line record, ?format? should be a character vector.
     For a multiline record it should be a list with a character vector
     for each line.

</quote>?


?I think (not sure) you need:

mydata<-read.frotran("G:/Journals/Disk1/12_restat_95/estimate/GROUPD.DAT",
list(c("1X","F6.0","5F8.6"),c("1X","5F8.4","F10.6"),c("1X","2F6.0","3E15.9","F8.0","F5.2","F5.3"),c("1X","F7.0","2E15.9","F9.4","F5.3")).
?
col.names=c("year","w1","w2","w3","w4","w5","w6","v1","v2","v3",
"v4","v5","v6","z","chyes","chno","ec","vc","cvc",
"pop","ahs","fah","tnh","eq","vq","ups","zm1 "))

If you read the Posting Guide it warns you against posting in HTML (it doesn't say why but basically what you think you sent is not necessarily what we saw). It also mentions that you should update to the latest version of R (yours is not) if you want help (though we might try anyway). It also mentions that you need to post a reproducible example... what the heck did you do that did not work? 

install.packages( "pcalg" )

worked fine for me on Windows 7.

I downloaded the attached file to your first posting that was called a "csv" file but it was tab-separated (as could be clearly seen with the str output, so would only load properly with read.delim rather than read.csv. Running then with the lme call, it produced this message

> model1 <- lme(preDawn ~ Irrigation, random=~season_order|treeNo, data=Eboni2)
Error in na.fail.default(list(season_order = c(5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L,  : 
  missing values in object

And looking at the str result made it clear that there were many NA's in the file.

And even more importantly, there was one NA in your outcome variable:
> sum( is.na(Eboni2$Irrigation))
[1] 0
> sum( is.na(Eboni2$preDawn))
[1] 1

So after restricting to complete.cases, I then formed the hypothesis that you reversed the order of the variables in the formula for the random parameter:

> table(Eboni2$season_order)

 1  2  3  4  5 
83 83 83 83 83 
> length( Eboni2$treeNo)
[1] 415

So it seemed unreasonable to have a "grouping" on variable with only one item per group.

> model1 <- lme(preDawn ~ Irrigation, random=~treeNo|season_order, data=Eboni2[ complete.cases( Eboni2[ , c('preDawn','Irrigation','season_order','treeNo')]), ] )

Just to correct some misinformation that appeared earlier: You can attach "csv" or "tsv" files as long as you name them with an .txt extension so the mail clients and servers consider them to be MIME-text.

Subject: [R] performance of svm (e1071) on windows 64 bits vs 32 bits
Message-ID: <BAY178-W23EF4CFCD6FA5340BFB44ABF420@phx.gbl>

Dear R users,
I?ve been using SVM (e1071) on different 64 bits linux distributions very successfully. 
Very recently I had to migrate some of our codes to a server with xeon e7 processors, 65 gb of RAM, running Windows. Very surprisingly, the peformance of the same code, in the same server, on R 32 bits was much better than on R 64 bits (~5 times).   I confirmed these results in another windows machine, now a notebook, to exclude the possibility of a problem specific to that server.
In both cases, R 32 bits is using more RAM memory (~900 mb) than 64 bits (~600 mb). Changing cache size of SVM doesn?t impact it.
As I need to use de 64 bits version, I went to internet looking for ways of improving the perfomance of 64 bits version. Reading about possible causes, I arrived to Blas and Lapack issues. I have tried different pre-compiled Rblas.dll available on the internet, including SurviveGotoBLAS-3.14. Also, I tried to use R from Revolution Analytics (Revolution R Open) that has a optimized Blas (Intel MKL) , without any visible.
Could you give any help or share similar experience with this issue? 
Thank you very much for your help.
Frederico Arnoldi

Hi Josh 

Thanks a lot - appreciate the answer. Figured it may have worked that way but investigating the url called by the package was a smart move. Guess I'll need to get the info from Bloomberg!

Thanks again

Use reply-all to keep the list in the loop. 

I happen to have this old version of R still around on Windows 7 and it installs just fine for me. 

You may be able to get it to install by choosing a different CRAN mirror, but I still recommend that you upgrade R and try with that before posting again.

Greetings David,
I am new to R and neglected to check vigorously for missing values.
Apologize for posting without checking and finding the one NA.

I appreciate your help.
Thanks.

Thanks John. That helped, but I got a mixed of good thing and bad thing. 
Good is R does not like the scientific number format "3E15.9" but I was 
able to read with alphanumerical format "3A15" (and convert to 
numerical). Bad is R does not like the numbers .1234, .2345 without the 
zeros before the decimal points. My data look like:

   1950. .614350 .026834 .087227 .006821 .180001 .084766

The first variable was read correctly, followed by six 0's.

As the instructions say, this fortran format is approximation at best 
and in this case, a poort approximation.

It has been a while since I used Fortran formatted input, but the following,
without dots in the format, works:

> txt <- "1950. .614350 .026834 .087227 .006821 .180001 4.56E-2"
> print(read.fortran(textConnection(txt), c("f5", "6f8")), digits=10)

1 1950 0.61435 0.026834 0.087227 0.006821 0.180001 0.0456


If I recall correctly, a dot in the format pushes the decimal point:

> print(read.fortran(textConnection(txt), c("f5", "6f8.3")), digits=10)
    V1         V2         V3         V4        V5          V6       V7

Subject: [R] Dynamically populate a vector by iteratively applying a
 function to its previous element.
Message-ID: <CABSrU1KfOky3Q92k8g2j_etehsFnBq_=apqkGUGW8ZYpvAhuWQ@mail.gmail.com>

I want to dynamically populate a vector by iteratively applying a
function to its previous element, without using a 'for' cycle. My
solution, based on a question I posted some times ago for a more
complicated problem (see "updating elements of a list of matrixes
without 'for' cycles") was to define a matrix of indexes, and then
apply the function to the indexes. Here's a trivial example:

# my vector, all elements still unassigned
v <- rep(NA, 10)
# initialisation
v[1] <- 0

# the function to be applied
v.fun = function(x) {
  i <- x[1]
  return(v[i]+1)
}

# The matrix of array indices
idx <- as.matrix(expand.grid(c(1:9)))

# Application of the function
r[2:10] <- invisible(apply(idx, 1, v.fun))

[Note that this example is deliberately trivial: v <-c(0:9) would
solve the problem. In general, the function can be more complicated.]

The trick works only for v[2]. I imagine this is because the vector is
not dynamically updated during the iteration, so all values v[2:10]
are retained as NA.

How can I solve the problem, without using a 'for' cycle?
Thanks for your help ! Matteo

You have set yourself an impossible goal. Either you can reformulate your problem as non-iterative and can process your data as arrays, or you have to use some kind of for loop. The lapply and Vectorize functions are popular "pretty" ways to do this, but they amount to hidden for loops. 

Note that certain instances of iterative algorithms may have optimized compiled calculation functions ready for your use,  but unless someone has figured out some algorithm-specific optimization they won't be significantly faster than an R for loop. 

The best you can do is avoid allocating growing data structures... pre-allocate your result and fill it in as you go.

That's great, John. Your mother told you when you were born? How am I 
supposed to know? Thank you both.
The following format statement did it!! I just change F5.3 to F5, 5F8.4 
to 5F8. I also change 2E15.9 to 2A9, and then use the following 
as.numeric to convert the alphanumerical to numerical. Thank you!!!

mydata<-read.fortran("GROUPC.DAT",
         list(c("1X","F6","5F8"),
              c("1X","5F8","F10"),
              c("1X","2F6","3A15","F8","F5","F5"),
              c("1X","F7","2A15","F9","F5")),
col.names=c("year","w1","w2","w3","w4","w5","v1","v2","v3",
"v4","v5","m","chyes","chno","ec","vc","cvc",
"pop","ahs","fah","tnh","eq","vq","ups","zm1"))
mydata$ec <-as.numeric(mydata$ec)

Your rather sarcastic comment about knowledge given by John's mother seems inappropriate, given that he told you where his information came from and it is the first place you should have looked. 

The bit about the decimal leading to a shift in the decimal place pointed out by Bill is a bit obscure, though it to is mentioned in the help file. 

The "D" format is broken though... the regex template in the processFormat embedded function is missing that option. Bill's use of 'F' instead with no decimal is the easy workaround, but that is a bug.

?Hi. I am new to R and confused by some conflicting and contradictory information about it. Where and how do I create a numeric data file with .csv extension for use in R? So numbers meaning numeric data will be separated by commas and will consist of one line of numbers randomly chosen from 1 to 40. Thanks to all who reply. jay28.

I don?t understand how the calls to the help function would not answer both aspects:

?write.csv
?sample

?

When you need numerical data input in R programs, you can use EXCEL to create .csv file.  When you need output calculation results, you can write out .csv file in R programs.

Yes, the most common .cvs file format is comma seperated numerical values.  You can use EXCEL to create .csv file, and view the content with text editor.

This sounds like homework, which has been determined to be off-topic on this help list. Please read the Posting Guide before posting. 

That said, it would appear the OP may need to read about data frames in, say, the Introduction to R... and perhaps about matrices... and using the as.* functions to convert between them... in addition to the below-mentioned help pages.

hi, here's a minimal reproducible example that crashes my R 3.3.0 console

crash) that occurs on R 3.2.3.

should this be reported to http://bugs.r-project.org/ or am i doing

Message-ID: <CY1PR07MB2588649657A578FE4E6A6BE8FA430@CY1PR07MB2588.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

I want to print a table where table elements are colored according to the frequency of the bin. ?For example, consider below table.?

Function values that I would like to print in the table

                            x.eq.minus1  x.eq.zero  x.eq.plus1
y.eq.minus1             -20                 10            -5
y.eq.zero                 -10                  6             22
y.eq.plus1                -8                    10           -14


Frequency table to color the above table

                            x.eq.minus1  x.eq.zero  x.eq.plus1
y.eq.minus1             0.05             0.15           0.1
y.eq.zero                 0.07             0.3           0.08
y.eq.plus1                0.05            0.15           0.05


In the resulting table, the element for (x = 0, y = 0) will be 6.  This will be printed with a dark color background.  The element for (x = -1, y = -1) will be -20.  This will be printed with a light color background.  And so on.  

Thanks for your help,
Naresh

Hi Naresh:

I shall be brief, as discussions of what statistical/graphical techniques
to use are largely OT.

IMO, this is a bad idea. I think the table entries will be very difficult
to read and groc. If the tables are unrelated, use 2 tables. If you think
they might be related, plot the entries of one versus the other in a
scatter plot. Another possibility would be plot the values as separate bars
in a trellis plot with you table x and y categorical values as conditioning
factors. Judging and comparing bar lengths is much more accurate than
trying to quantify shading density.

Cheers,
Bert

If you don't mix the text and color, heatmaps are pretty standard presentation techniques.

From the R FAQ (9.1):

If R executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating system
error message that indicates a problem in the program (as opposed to
something like ?disk full?), then it is certainly a bug.

  So you could submit a bug report, *or* open a discussion on
r-devel at r-project.org  (which I'd have said was a more appropriate
venue for this question in any case) ...

How to do this depends on how you want to print the result.  Are you 
looking for a LaTeX table, HTML, Word, or what?

Indeed.
In this case, this is a known problem -- not just of R, but of
many programs that you can run ---
You are requesting (much) more memory than your computer has
RAM, and in this situation -- depending on the OS ---
your computer will kill R (what you saw) or your it will become
very slow trying to shove all memory to R and start swapping
(out to disk other running / sleeping processes on the
computer).

Both is very unpleasant...
But it is you as R user who asked R to allocate an object of
about 41.6 Gigabytes (26 * 1.6, see below).

As Ben mentioned this may be worth a discussion on R-devel ...
or you rather follow up the existing thread opened by Marius
Hofert  three weeks ago, with subject
 "[Rd] R process killed when allocating too large matrix (Mac OS X)"

  -->  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2016-May/072648.html
 
His simple command to "crash R" was

   matrix(0, 1e5, 1e5)

which for some of use gives an error such as

> x <- matrix(0, 1e5,1e5)
Error: cannot allocate vector of size 74.5 Gb

but for others it had the same effect as your example.
BTW: I repeat it here in a functionalized form with added
     comments which makes apparent what's going on:


## Make simple data.frame
mkDf <- function(grpsize, wrongSize = FALSE) {
    ne <- (if(wrongSize) 26 else 1) *grpsize
    data.frame(x = rep(LETTERS, each = ne),
               v = runif(grpsize*26), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
}

g1 <- ceiling(10^5/26)
d1 <- mkDf(g1) # works fine
str(d1)
## 'data.frame':	100022 obs. of  2 variables:

dP <- mkDf(g1, wrong=TRUE)# mis-matching the number of elements

str(dP) # is 26 times larger
## 'data.frame': 2600572 obs. of  2 variables: .....


# make this much bigger
gLarge <- ceiling(10^8/26)

dL <- mkDf(gLarge) # works "fine" .. (well, takes time!!)
str(dL)
## 'data.frame': 100000004 obs. of  2 variables:
as.numeric(print(object.size(dL)) / 1e6)
## 1600002088 bytes
## [1] 1600.002  Mega  i.e.,  1.6 GBytes

## Well, this will be 26 times larger than already large ==> your R may crash *OR*
 ## your computer may basically slow down to a crawl, when R requests all its memory...

or simply  na.omit(tt)

as it omits both NA and NaN (and *does* keep the 'ts' properties

Subject: [R] sandwich package: HAC estimators
Message-ID: <5a4a4884895348f8b010876f9ca10151@ex13-live-mbn1.ad.kent.ac.uk>

Dear R users,

I am running a logistic regression using the rms package and the code looks as follows:

crisis_bubble4<-lrm(stock.market.crash~crash.MA+bubble.MA+MP.MA+UTS.MA+UPR.MA+PPI.MA+RV.MA,data=Data_logitregression_movingaverage)

Now, I would like to calculate HAC robust standard errors using the sandwich package assuming the NeweyWest estimator which looks as follows:


coeftest(crisis_bubble4,df=Inf,vcov=NeweyWest)

Error in match.arg(type) :

  'arg' should be one of "li.shepherd", "ordinary", "score", "score.binary", "pearson", "deviance", "pseudo.dep", "partial", "dfbeta", "dfbetas", "dffit", "dffits", "hat", "gof", "lp1"

As you can see, it doesn't work. Therefore, I did the same using the glm() instead of lrm():


crisis_bubble4<-glm(stock.market.crash~crash.MA+bubble.MA+MP.MA+UTS.MA+UPR.MA+PPI.MA+RV.MA,family=binomial("logit"),data=Data_logitregression_movingaverage)



If I use the coeftest() function, I get following results.

coeftest(crisis_bubble4,df=Inf,vcov=NeweyWest)



z test of coefficients:



              Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)

(Intercept)   -5.26088    5.01706 -1.0486  0.29436

crash.MA       0.49219    2.41688  0.2036  0.83863

UPR.MA      -337.57985  395.35639 -0.8539  0.39318

PPI.MA       729.37693  358.60868  2.0339  0.04196 *

RV.MA        116.00106   79.52421  1.4587  0.14465

---

Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1


I am unsure whether the coeftest from the lmtest package is appropriate in case of a logistic regression. Is there another function for logistic regressions? Furthermore, I would like to present the regression coefficients, the F-statistic and the HAC estimators in one single table. How can I do that?

I thought it would be useful to incorporate the HAC consistent covariance matrix into the logistic regression directly and generate an output of coefficients and the corresponding standard errors. Is there such a function in R?

Thanks for your support.

Kind regards

I don't think that is how real Fortran formats work.  My memory is that
you only put a dot in the format if there were no dots in your data file
(so you could avoid wasting one of the 80 columns on the punched card
on a dot).

With current gfortran, putting a dot in the data overrides the decimal
place specification in the format.

% cat format.f
      double precision d1, d2
      integer*4 i1
      integer*4 i

 10   format(I2F7.1F7.6)
      do 20 i=1,100
        read(*,10) i1, d1, d2
        write(*,*) i1, d1, d2
 20   continue
      stop
      end

% gfortran format.f -o format.exe
% ./format.exe
1234012340987654
          12   340123.40000000002       0.98765400000000003
123.0123409.7e20
          12   3.0123400000000000        9.7000000000000000E+020
123.012340976e20
          12   3.0123400000000000        97600000000000000.

Hi all,
  I tried to use the package "XLConnect" to read excel data into R.  I got
the following error message:

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
  call: fun(libname, pkgname)
  error: No CurrentVersion entry in Software/JavaSoft registry! Try
re-installing Java and make sure R and Java have matching
architectures.


  I tried read.xls and got the following error  message:

> library(gdata)> one <- read.xls ("one.xlsx", sheet=1)Error in findPerl(verbose = verbose) :
  perl executable not found. Use perl= argument to specify the correct
path.Error in file.exists(tfn) : invalid 'file' argument


  Can anyone give me some input on this?

Apparently you need to get your Java runtime setup, or install Perl, depending which of these tools you want to use. 

Or if your data are laid out simply, you might be able to use the readxl package.

Yes. The "sandwich" package relies on two methods being available: bread() 
and estfun(). See vignette("sandwich-OOP", package = "sandwich") for the 
background details.

For objects of class "lrm" no such methods are available. But as "lrm" 
objects inherit from "glm" the corresponding methods are called. However, 
"lrm" objects are actually too different from "glm" objects (despite the 
inheritance) resulting in the error.

It is easy to add these methods, though, because "lrm" brings all the 
necessary information:

bread.lrm <- function(x, ...) vcov(x) * nobs(x)
estfun.lrm <- function(x, ...) residuals(x, "score")

Some of these coefficients and standard errors are suspiciously large. It 
might make sense to check for quasi-complete separation.

Yes, this is ok. (Whether or not the application of HAC standard errors is 
the best way to go is a different matter though.)

Running first coeftest() and then lrtest() should get you close to what 
you want - even though it is not a single table.

Not with HAC standard errors, I think.

# read about POSIXlt at ?DateTimeClasses
# note that the "mon" element is 0-11
isPartialWaterYear <- function( d ) {
   dtl <- as.POSIXlt( dat$Date )
   wy1 <- cumsum( ( 9 == dtl$mon ) & ( 1 == dtl$mday ) )
   ( 0 == wy1  # first partial year
   | (  8 != dtl$mon[ nrow( dat ) ] # end partial year
     & 30 != dtl$mday[ nrow( dat ) ]
     ) & wy1[ nrow( dat ) ] == wy1
   )
}

dat2 <- dat[ !isPartialWaterYear( dat$Date ), ]

The above assumes that, as you said, the data are continuous at one-day 
intervals, such that the only partial years will occur at the beginning 
and end. The "diff" function could be used to identify irregular data 
within the data interval if needed.

There are myriad ways to create *.csv files, including text editors and

Try the 'openxlsx' package.  I gave up using XLConnect because of the Java
requirement, and speed on larger tables. "openxlsx" has the access routines
written in C so you don't need any other outside dependencies.

You are right, that it is unnecessary to relate to excel.  I explain this way, because I often tutor people with little programming experience, and often I tutor people with no concept of ?text editors?.

Hi Naresh,
Have a look a the addtable2plot function (plotrix), especially the
second example, and the color.scale function, also in plotrix.

This 'dotchart' solution worked fine and I got what I wanted :) However, 
I still wonder why the same idea does not work with lattice (e.g. using 
'scales=list(y=list(cex=log(abs(kedf$Freq))+1))'

This is also a nice idea to scale the dots. Thanks for pointing this out.

R doesn't currently have a translation team (see 
translation.r-project.org) for Urdu, so it may be hard for you to get 
Urdu-specific support.  However, I would guess the problems you are 
having are common to other languages that use non-Roman alphabets, and 
you may get some advice from the translation teams for one of them.

The general issues that I know of are:

  - R needs to know your encoding.  On Unix-alikes the best support is 
for UTF-8; Windows support is weaker, because Windows tends to use 
UTF-16 or other multibyte encodings, and R's support for those is mixed.

  - You need to make sure your graphics device supports your alphabet. 
Not all graphics devices have character support for all languages.

Hi Naresh

If you want to make a graphic of the table, with the frequencies printed 
in the cells try a mosaic plot from the vcd package

library(vcd)
mosaic(HairEyeColor[,,1], shade = TRUE, legend=FALSE, 
labeling=labeling_values)

or to make cell sizes proportional to expected frequencies,

mosaic(HairEyeColor[,,1], shade = TRUE, legend=FALSE, 
labeling=labeling_values, type="expected")

You can also use ggplot2::geom_tile() for something that is a more 
direct version of a table or a heatmap, with shaded backgrounds, and 
geom_text()
to print the values.

 From an non-reproducible example of mine, where cells are filled
with a unidimensional range of colors from white to blue, and
the text is printed in black, until the background gets too dark:

p <- ggplot(ht2, aes(decade, variable)) +
       geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq), color = "white") +
       scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
       geom_text(aes(fill = Freq, label = Freq),
                 colour = ifelse(ht2$Freq > 40, "white", "black")) +
       labs(title = "Keyword Occurrences by Topic and Year",
            x = "Decade", y = "Keyword")

In contrast to what someone else expressed, for some purposes --- where 
you want to show the _pattern_ of values in a table directly, colored 
backgrounds, if done judiciously can be extremely useful to show the 
viewer what is important.

Would it be a good idea to mention Urdu in the subject line as other 
people who deal with Urdu, but not specifically text mining, may be able

Subject: [R] zelig package: robust SE
Message-ID: <8c76c3349731445dba5ba8feca07daf1@ex13-live-mbn1.ad.kent.ac.uk>

Dear R users,

I am trying to run a logistic regression using zelig. The simple logistic regression works well but now I want to have HAC robust standard errors. I have read in the manual that there is an option called "robust" and that zelig() computes robust SE via the sandwich package. However, it doesn't work. My code looks as follows:


crisis_bubble4<-zelig(stock.market.crash~crash.MA+bubble.MA+MP.MA<http://mp.ma/>+UTS.MA<http://uts.ma/>+UPR.MA<http://upr.ma/>+PPI.MA<http://ppi.ma/>+RV.MA<http://rv.ma/>,robust=TRUE,model="logit",data=Data_logitregression_movingaverage)

Error in glm.control(robust = TRUE) : unused argument (robust = TRUE)



I took this code from the zelig manual and don't understand why I get an error. What is more, I want to calculate NeweyWest SE or the SE using the weights by Andrews via the kernHAC function. How can I do that?

Thanks for your support.

Kind regards

Subject: [R] model specification using lme
Message-ID: <CAHLnndYK-UEt84Mb9Rncm_Q1aTOX8EzttfE-Jt1JGN0dg0MMDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  For the following data, I consider the following random intercept and
random slope model. Denote as y_ijk the response value from *j*th
individual within *i*th method at time point *k*. Assume the following
model for y_ijk:

      y_ijk= (alpha_0+ tau_i +a_j(i))+(beta_i+b_j(i)) T_k + e_ijk


Here alpha_0 is the grand mean;
          tau_i is the fixed effect for ith method;
          a_j(i) is random intercept corresponding to the *j*th individual
within *i*th method, assumed to be common for all three methods;
          beta_i is the fixed slope corresponding to the ith method;
          b_j(i) is the random slope corresponding to jth individual for
the ith method, assumed to be different for different methods;
          T_k is the time corresponding to y_ijk;
          e_ijk is the residual.

For this model, I consider the three specification using  the lme function
as follows:


mod1 <- lme(fixed= reponse ~ method*time, random=~ 1 +time | individual,
data=one, weights= varIdent(form=~1|method),
            control = lmeControl(opt = "optim"))

mod2 <- lme(fixed= reponse ~ method*time, random=~ 0 +time | individual,
data=one, weights= varIdent(form=~1|method),
            control = lmeControl(opt = "optim"))

mod3 <- lme(fixed= reponse ~ method*time, random=~ method +time |
individual, data=one, weights= varIdent(form=~1|method),
            control = lmeControl(opt = "optim"))

I think mod1 is the correct one. However, I am kind of confused with the
right usage of lme function. Can someone familiar with this give some help
here?

Another question is regarding the fixed effect   tau_1, tau_2 and tau_3
(corresponding to the three methods). One main question I am interested in
is whether each of them are statistically different from zero. In the
summary results below (shaded part), it looks that the result for method 2
and 3 are given with reference to method 1). Is there a way to obtain
specific result separately for alpha_0 (the overall mean) and also tau_1,
tau_2 and tau3?

Thanks very much for the help!

Possibly this changed in recent versions of "Zelig". The documentation 
for relogit on the official Zelig web page shows the same error:
http://docs.zeligproject.org/en/latest/zelig-relogit.html#example-2-one-tau-with-weighting-robust-standard-errors-and-bias-correction

In any case, Zelig only interfaced the so-called "robust" standard errors 
(sandwich or HC0) and not the ones with HAC correction.

Why do you want to use Zelig? Apparently, the solution using plain glm() 
along with the sandwich package and coeftest() did work for you. And in my 
other e-mail I showed you how you can use lrm().

In class, we were given an Excel worksheet with specified formulas that take the total score from a survey (or from a specific section) and convert it to a percentage, according to a table that assigns scores to a percentile. Since the formulas are too long and complicated (some have been input by hand) I figured we could fit the data with a function with some parameters. I plotted the table and sure it resembled a more-or-less symmetrical quantile function, and I wanted to use R to find a curve that fitted the data. Here it is:

Use approxfun:

myapprox <- approxfun( x=score, y=percentile)

> myapprox(27.8)
[1] 0.29

> myapprox(27.8)
[1] 0.29

[1] NA

You can change how values outside the max and min limits are handles with furhter arguments to approxfun.

Subject: [R] How to real multiple raster and serial correlation between
 series of rasters
Message-ID: <SNT151-W95DFBC94C5A64DB9BCC09DEB440@phx.gbl>




Hi,
I have 120 raster (10 years) files
in tif format of one variable (say X1) and same numbers for second variables (Say
X2). Each raster consists the mean monthly values of corresponding variables. I
want to write a script in R which operates the following operations:

?        
First reads the one by one
raster from folder and save into the objects. 

?        
Resample/aggregate the both
raster over same spatial resolution 2? x 2.5?.

?        
After resampling the all
raster over same resolution, conversions of all raster to points by using the
rasterToPoint() function of raster library.

?        
After retrieving the same
monthly raster values (like month of January for X1 and X2) into data frame, I
want to compute regression and correlation values for all 120 raster for both
variables (X1 and X2) and save into the data frame.

Is there any way out to deal with
such task.


library(raster)

x <- list.files("C:/site-download/",
pattern = "*.tif", full.names = TRUE)

x1 <- raster(x1)

p <- as(x1, 'SpatialPixels')

plot(x1)

points(p)
Resultant figure has been attached for you for only x1 variable. I have also attached the X1 and X2 variable tif raster for January 2002 for computation purpose. I need to operate it through loop for reading all these rasters and computing the correlation of each pairs. My next step to compute the Lag -1 correlations which is Serial Correlation for both variables.

  If someone answers here, that's great, but I'm guessing that you
will have better luck re-posting this to r-sig-mixed-models at r-project.org
(maybe wait a day or so before re-posting, and when you do, mention that 
you're reposting)

Dear Hanna,

None of the models are correct is you want the same random intercept for
the different methods but different random slope per method.

You can random = ~ 1 + time:method | individual

The easiest way to get alpha_0 and tau_i is to apply post-hoc contrasts.
That is fairly easy to do with the multcomp package.

alpha_0 = (m1 + m2 + m3) / 3
m1 = intercept
m2 = intercept + method2
m3 = intercept + method3
hence alpha_0 = intercept + method2/3 + method3/3

m1 = alpha_0 + tau_1
tau_1 = intercept - method2/3 - method3/3

Hi all,

I'm seeing the natural sequencing of email threads getting corrupted. For example, a May 26 thread on subject 'Shaded areas in R' would have been initiated by an email at 6:58am. However I did not get that email until 1:48pm, preceded by 3 replies to the post. Trivial but irritating. The preceding replies suggest this is something going on at my end, perhaps related to network security. I'm curious what might be causing it, and if there is something I can do about it - short of contacting IT staff, which is more irritating than the corrupted threads.

Semi-Fortune!? This is probably not quite suitable for the fortunes
package, but I still think it's clever.

Best,

If it's a CSV, you may read the file and then write it again (second
file name, for safety) with write.csv2.

Hi Guru's
In my quest to understand R I have what I thought was a simple exercise that now has me baffled.? Why the error message after running this code?? I am totally baffled by the error message.? I was expecting rows 1 and 3 of the x matrix to be returned, and have not a clue as to why this becomes a subscript difficulty.? The manual was of no help in this matter.

x <- c(1:3,2:4)
x? <- matrix(x, nrow = 3)
x
z <- c(1:4,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0)
z <- matrix(z, ncol = 3)
z
x[x[,2]>= 3,]
x
z %% 2 == 1
x[z %% 2 == 1,]Error in x[z%%2 == 1, ] : (subscript) logical subscript too long
Many thanks for your assistance.

Subject: [R] graphic device Windows tickmarks
Message-ID: <71669970-af54-6f16-0f88-e3edc9cf8101@gmail.com>

Dear List,

I discovered an issue; when plotting (base) in R, the tickmark-labels 
are slightly off (Windows machine).

Thus, when saving the plot in R with x11() and dev(...) the 
plot-tickmarks shift, see the example below.

Session Info:

R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
Running under: Windows 7 x64 (build 7601) Service Pack 1

With savePlot it works, but the graph quality is not as nice. Am I 
missing something here?


Example:
thickticks <- 
c(0,40,90,140,200,260,320,380,440,500,560,620,680,740,800,860,920,980)

x11(width=12,height=12)
plot(seq(0,1000),rep(10,1001),xaxt="n")
axis(1,seq(0,1000,by=10),at=seq(0,1000,by=10),tick=TRUE)
axis(1, at = thickticks, labels=FALSE, las = 1,lwd.ticks=2)

# plots
dev.print(device=png,"test.png",units="in",width=12,height=12,res=500) # 
won't display prop.
dev.print(device=postscript,"test.eps",width=12,height=12)  # won't 
display prop.
dev.print(device=pdf,"test.pdf",width=12,height=12)  # won't display prop.
savePlot("test_2.png",type="png") # displays prop.

Subject: [R] Regression and Sub-Groups Analysis in Metafor
Message-ID: <CAB01jfLmwNozOh0d+L=R1nVL6O1L1kLO+YiKU1F6VqiNxmD=rQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am completing a meta-analysis on the effect of CBT on low self-esteem and
I could use some help regarding the regression feature in metafor.  Based
on the studies that I am using for the analysis, I identified 4 potential
moderators that I want to explore:
- Some of the studies that I am using used RCTs to compare an intervention
with a waitlist and others used the pre-score as the control in a
single-group design.
- Some of the groups took place in one day and others took several weeks.
- There are three discernible interventions being represented
- The initial level of self-esteem varies

Based on the above, I used this command to conduct a meta-analysis using
standarized mean differences:



MetaMod<-rma(m1i=m1, m2i=m2, sd1i=sd1, sd2i=sd2, n1i=n1, n2i=n2,
mods=cbind(dur, rct, int, level),measure = "SMD")



Would this be the best command to use for what I described?  Also, what
could I add to the command so that the forest plot shows a sub-group
analysis using the 'dur' variable as a between-groups distinction?


Also, with respect to the moderators, this is what was delivered:



Test of Moderators (coefficient(s) 2,3,4,5):
QM(df = 4) = 8.7815, p-val = 0.0668

Model Results:

         estimate      se     zval    pval    ci.lb   ci.ub
intrcpt    0.7005  0.6251   1.1207  0.2624  -0.5246  1.9256
dur        0.5364  0.2411   2.2249  0.0261   0.0639  1.0090  *
rct       -0.3714  0.1951  -1.9035  0.0570  -0.7537  0.0110  .
int        0.0730  0.1102   0.6628  0.5075  -0.1430  0.2890
level     -0.2819  0.2139  -1.3180  0.1875  -0.7010  0.1373

---
Signif. codes:  0 ?***? 0.001 ?**? 0.01 ?*? 0.05 ?.? 0.1 ? ? 1



>From this, can I interpret that the variable 'dur' (duration of
intervention) has a significant effect and the variable 'rct' (whether a
study was an RCT or used pre-post scores) was just shy of being
statistically significant?  I mainly ask, because the QM-score has a
p-value of 0.0668, which I thought would mean that none of the moderators
would be significant.  Would I be better off just listing one or two
moderators instead of four?

Much appreciated,
Dan

Don't glmrob() and summary.glmrob(), from robustbase, do that?

Hi Mark,
As with most other annoying, time-consuming operations in the internet
and computing in general, blame the spammers and the scammers. The R
help list is attacked by both and requires both automatic and human
scanning of messages to minimize intrusions. Unfortunately no one has
come up with a simple and inexpensive way to convert the senders to
fertilizer.

Hi Jun,
As you do seem to want to replace commas within, not between, strings, try gsub:

gsub(",",";",test[,1])

Mark, you can follow the bouncing emails by looking at the raw message 
headers. How you would access them depends on your email client, 
but "Received:" headers appear in reverse chronological order above the 
"From:" line, indicating the times when the email had reached various 
servers in its journey. Just be sure to subtract the timezone offset 
before comparing timestamps to see the chronology in UTC.

The original email appears to have spent about 4.5 hours at 
"phil3.ethz.ch", possibly awaiting moderator approval. The mailing list 
spam evaluation headers indicate that it did not think the email was spam, 
so some more basic rule or server downtime must have delayed it. 
Subsequent emails in that thread appear to have come in chronological 
order to my email server.

Sorry, I don't have R code to do that analysis (I did the above by 
inspection), so I will shut up now.

Hi all,

I have a messy text file and from this text file I want extract some

Mean of weight  group 1, SE of mean  :  72.289037489555276
 11.512956539215610
Average weight of group 2, SE of Mean :  83.940053900595013
  10.198495690144522
group 3 mean , SE of Mean     :                78.310441258245469

Mean of weight of group 4, SE of Mean               : 76.967516495101669
 12.1254882985

I want produce the following  table. How do i read it first and then
produce a


Gr1  72.289037489555276   11.512956539215610

Hi Val,

Take a kook at read.table. If for some reason the file dosen't have the
same separator between the columns you can use strsplit after loading the
file.

This might helpyou along getting data into R:

v3 <- as.numeric( indta[ firstlines + 1 ] )
# put it all into a data frame
result <- data.frame( Group = v1, Mean = v2, SE = v3 )

Figuring out how to deliver your result (output) is a separate question 
that depends where you want it to go.

and just in case of unit problems I worked in the default units

Check ?postscript and the options as eps and pdf require different

All the above work for me on Win 7 32

platform       i386-w64-mingw32

system         i386, mingw32

Similar to the above has worked on Win 64

Subject: [R] graphic device Windows tickmarks

Dear List,

I discovered an issue; when plotting (base) in R, the tickmark-labels 
are slightly off (Windows machine).

Thus, when saving the plot in R with x11() and dev(...) the 
plot-tickmarks shift, see the example below.

Session Info:

R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
Running under: Windows 7 x64 (build 7601) Service Pack 1

With savePlot it works, but the graph quality is not as nice. Am I 
missing something here?


Example:
thickticks <- 
c(0,40,90,140,200,260,320,380,440,500,560,620,680,740,800,860,920,980)

x11(width=12,height=12)
plot(seq(0,1000),rep(10,1001),xaxt="n")
axis(1,seq(0,1000,by=10),at=seq(0,1000,by=10),tick=TRUE)
axis(1, at = thickticks, labels=FALSE, las = 1,lwd.ticks=2)

# plots
dev.print(device=png,"test.png",units="in",width=12,height=12,res=500) # 
won't display prop.
dev.print(device=postscript,"test.eps",width=12,height=12)  # won't 
display prop.
dev.print(device=pdf,"test.pdf",width=12,height=12)  # won't display prop.
savePlot("test_2.png",type="png") # displays prop.

Hi All,

I thought dataset$variable is the same as dataset["variable"]. I tried the 
following:

> str(ZWW_Kunden$Branche)
 chr [1:49673] "231" "151" "151" "231" "231" "111" "231" "111" "231" "231" 
"151" "111" ...
> str(ZWW_Kunden["Branche"])
'data.frame':            49673 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ Branche: chr  "231" "151" "151" "231" ...

and get different results: "chr {1:49673]" vs. "data.frame". First one is 
a simple vector, second one is a data.frame.

This has consequences when subsetting a dataset and filter cases:

> ZWW_Kunden["Branche"] %in% c("315", "316", "317")
[1] FALSE

> head(ZWW_Kunden$Branche %in% c("315", "316", "317")) # head() only to 
shorten output
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

I have thought dataset$variable is the same as dataset["variable"] but 
actually it's not.

Can you explain what the difference is?

Kind regards

Georg

Message-ID: <CAOyz9G7Usi-idHK-UerLZx4rWGP+PLO4Jt6iBkHdHLLzGBfYdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am running a simulation experiment with 8 factors that each have 4
levels. Each combination is repeated 100 times. If I run a full factorial
this would mean 100*8^4 = 409,600 runs.

I am trying to reduce the number of scenarios to run using a fractional
factorial design. I'm interested in estimating the main effects of the 8
factors plus their 2-way interactions. Any higher level interactions are
not of interest to me. My plan is to use a standard OLS regression for
that, once the simulations are over.

I tried to use the FrF2 package to derive a fractional factorial design but
it seems that this is only working for factors on two levels. Any idea how
I could derive a fractional factorial design on factors with four levels?

Thanks for your help,

Michael

You were clearly mistaken. 

dataframe$column is almost the same as dataframe[["column"]], except that the $ does partial matching. Both of these "extract" a list element. 

A data frame is a list where all elements are vectors of the same length.  A list is a vector where each element can refer to any of a variety of types of objects. The names of the objects in the list are associated with the list vector, not the referred objects (e.g. columns).  The [] operator "slices" the list but keeps the names and referring semantics. The [[]] extraction operator (and its pal $) refer to a single element out of the list, losing access to the containing list and the names that go with it. 

The Introduction to R document has all this in it... it just usually glazes your eyes the first few times you read it.  You might find the R Inferno more entertaining.

No, they implement a different concept of robustness. See also
https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Robust

glmrob() implements GLMs that are "robust" or rather "resistant" to 
outliers and other observations that do not come from the main model 
equation. Instead of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation other estimation 
techniques (along with corresponding covariances/standard errors) are 
used.

In contrast, the OP asked for HAC standard errors. The motivation for 
these is that the main model equation does hold for all observations but 
that the observations might be heteroskedastic and/or autocorrelated. In 
this situation, ML estimation is still consistent (albeit not efficient) 
but the covariance matrix estimate needs to be adjusted.

You could also say mods = ~ dur + rct + int + level

You have to adjust the forest plot by hand and then use add.polygon to 
add the summaries for each level of dur.

So the totality of moderators did not reach an arbitrary level of

At the moment you get an overall test of the moderators which you had a 
scientific reason for using. If you start selecting based on the data 
you run the risk of ending up with confidence intervals and significance 
levels which do not have the meaning they are supposed to have.

I understood. But how do I get the R2 an Chi2 of my logistic regression under HAC standard errors? I would like to create a table with HAC SE via e.g. stargazer(). 

Do I get these information by using the functions

bread.lrm <- function(x, ...) vcov(x) * nobs(x)
estfun.lrm <- function(x, ...) residuals(x, "score")?
 
Do I need to use the coeftest() in this case?

No, they implement a different concept of robustness. See also
https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Robust

glmrob() implements GLMs that are "robust" or rather "resistant" to
outliers and other observations that do not come from the main model
equation. Instead of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation other estimation
techniques (along with corresponding covariances/standard errors) are
used.

In contrast, the OP asked for HAC standard errors. The motivation for
these is that the main model equation does hold for all observations but
that the observations might be heteroskedastic and/or autocorrelated. In
this situation, ML estimation is still consistent (albeit not efficient)
but the covariance matrix estimate needs to be adjusted.

Hi,

thank you for your answer. To tackle down the problem, I tried this 
(modified from your code):

thickticks <- c(0,60,130,210,290,370,450,530,610,690,770,850,930)

png("test.png",width=864,height=834,res=150)
plot(seq(0,1000),rep(10,1001),xaxt="n")
axis(1,seq(0,1000,by=10),at=seq(0,1000,by=10),tick=TRUE)
axis(1, at = thickticks, labels=FALSE, las = 1,lwd.ticks=2)
dev.off()

x11()
plot(seq(0,1000),rep(10,1001),xaxt="n")
axis(1,seq(0,1000,by=10),at=seq(0,1000,by=10),tick=TRUE)
axis(1, at = thickticks, labels=FALSE, las = 1,lwd.ticks=2)

On my machine the x-axis-labels differ.
In the test.png the labels are 0,70,170,...
In the x11 window they are the same values as in the thickticks-vector.
Why? I tried to play with different resolution values, this didn't help.

Best, Christian

Message-ID: <OF1C9BED83.8BE86DD3-ONC1257FC4.00413344-C1257FC4.0041FD1B@lotus.hawesko.de>

Hi All,

I am using R for social sciences. In this field I am used to use short 
variable names like "q1" for question 1, "q2" for question 2 and so on and 
label the variables like q1 : "Please tell us your age" or q2 : "Could you 
state us your household income?" or something similar indicating which 
question is stored in the variable.

Similar I am used to label values like 1: "Less than 18 years", 2 : "18 to 
30 years", 3 : "31 to 60 years" and 4 : "61 years and more".

I know that the packages Hmisc and memisc have a functionality for this 
but these labeling functions are limited to the packages they were defined 
for. Using the question tests as variable names is possible but very 
inconvenient.

I there another way for labeling variables and values in R?

Kind regards

Georg Maubach

The bread()/estfun() methods enable application of vcovHAC(), kernHAC(), 
NeweyWest(). This in turn enables the application of coeftest(),
waldtest(), or linearHypothesis() with a suitable vcov argument.

All of these give you different kinds of Wald tests with HAC covariances 
including marginal tests of individual coefficients (coeftest) or global 
tests of nested models (waldtest/linearHypothesis). The latter can serve 
as replacement for the "chi-squared test". For pseudo-R-squared values I'm 
not familiar with HAC-adjusted variants.

And I'm not sure whether there is a LaTeX export solution that encompasses 
all of these aspects simultaneously.

Hi

I do not consider myself as an expert in factorial design but why do you insist on 4 levels in factors. My opinion is that you need more than 2 levels only if you expect and you want to evaluate nonlinear relationship of the response on such factor.

If you used only 2 levels you could find which factors are influential and they can be further tested on nonlinear response.

And even if you used only 2 levels you have to test 8 factors in at least 16 runs which, with 100 repetitions, gives me 1600 experiments (that seems to me quite a big deal).

Regards
Petr

Hi All,

I was new to R and this list a couple of mounths ago. When processing my 
data I got tremendous support from R-Help mailing list.

The solutions I have worked out with your help might be also helpful for 
others. I have put the solutions in a couple of small functions with 
documentation and tests. You can find the software on Sourceforge.net at

https://sourceforge.net/projects/r-project-utilities/files/?source=navbar

You should download at least "r_toolbox.R" and store it in a directory 
like "r_toolbox" in your favourite project folder. Within "r_toolbox" 
folder put all the other files. You have to adjust the variable 
"t_toolbox_path" to your favourite project directory including the 
"r_toolbox" folder, e. g. "C:\My-Projects\t-toolbox\" on Windows or 
"/home/username/my-projects/r-toolbox" on Unix-like systems.

You can use them for your projects. Although I developed them with great 
care these functions come with absolutely no warrenty. You need to use 
them at your own risk. As the functions are small and overseeable you will 
find out quickly by reading the source code that the functions are save to 
use.

If you have any recommendations or improvement proposals please get back 
to me.

Kind regards

Subject: [R] How to import sensitive data when multiple users collaborate on
	R-script?
Message-ID: <loom.20160531T123953-299@post.gmane.org>

We conduct medical research and our datafiles therefore contain sensitive
data, not to be shared in the cloud (Dropboc, Box, Drive, Bitbucket, GitHub).
When we collaborate on a r-analysis-script, we stumble upon the following
annoyance. Researcher 1 has a line in the script importing the sensitive
data from his/her personal computer. Researcher 2 has to put an additional
line importing the data from his/her personal computer. Thus, we have lines
in the script that are unnecessery for one or the other researcher. How can
we avoid this? Is there another way of conducting the collaboration. Other
workflow? 

I'm perhaps looking for something like:
"If the script is run on researcher 1 computer, load file from this
directory. If the script is run on researcher 2 computer, load data from
that directory". 

Example:
## Import data-------------------------------------
# Researcher 1 import data from laptop1, unnecessery line for Researcher 2
data <- read.table("/path/to_researcher1_computer/sensitive_data.csv") 

# Researcher 2 import data from laptop2 (unnecessery line for Researcher 1)
data <- read.table("/path/to_researcher2_computer/sensitive_data.csv") 

## Clean data
data$var1 <- NULL

## Analyze data
boxplot(data$var2)

here is the solution to your question

test <- data.frame(C1=c('a,b,c,d'),C2=c('g,h,f'))

you should use gsub instead sub if you want it to be on all elements of
each column

tFun <- function(x) {gsub(",",";",x)}
newTest <- apply(test, 2, tFun )

Seems to me that it is work for factors

nnn <- sample(1:4, 20, replace=TRUE)
q1 <-factor(nnn, labels=c("Less than 18 years", "18 to 30 years", "31 to 60 years","61 years and more"))

You can store such variables in data.frame with names "q1" to "qwhatever" and possibly "Subject"

And you can store annotation of questions in another data frame with 2 columns e.g. "Question" and "Description"

Basically it is an approach similar to database and in R you can merge those two data.frames by ?merge.

It seems to me strange. What prevents you to use functions from Hmisc?

?Well, I got a B.Sc. in Math back many years ago. I "earned" a C- in
Statistics (deserved). I don't use statistics normally. And I use R for
non-statistical purposes. In particular, I use it to read files into data
frames; do some minor statistical stuff (sum, mean, standard deviation,
other really simple stuff); then use ggplot2 to create really nice graphs
which I embed into a web page. I also use R to read a web site in order to
extract data in an HTML table into an R data frame. I then do some minor
manipulation and put the data into a PostgreSQL data base?. I even use it
to create Excel spreadsheets (for people at work who aren't wise enough to
abandon it for LibreOffice).

All that to say that, depending on your need, you don't need to learn
statistics to be able to use R. Of course, R was designed to make it easy
to do statistics. And many users here use it for that. But it is not a "one
trick pony".

My general approach to this is to put the function for loading data
into a separate file which is then sourced in the main analysis file.
Occasionally I'll use a construct like:

if file.exists("loadData_local.R")
  {
    source("loadData_local.R")
  }else{
    source("loadData_generic.R")
  }

Where loadData_generic.R contains the path to some sample (non-sensitive) data.

?Can you have the researchers input the name of the data file to be
analyzed? I use code similar to:

arguments <- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE);
#
# I put in the next command due to my own ignorance
# If you invoke an R script file using just R, you
# need to say something like:
# R BATCH CMD script.R --args ... other arguments ...
#
# but if you use Rscript, you invoke it like:
# Rscript script.R ... other arguments ...
#
# Well, I got confused and did:
# Rscript script.R --args ... other arguments ...
#
# The next line adjusts for my own idiocy.
if ("--args" == arguments[1]) arguments <- arguments[-1];
#
for (file in arguments) {
...
}

Please ignore the line about my own idiocy :-}

Another thought is to use an environment variable which is set in the
user's logon profile (or the Windows registry, forgive my ignorance of
Windows). I think this would be something like:

filename <- Sys.getenv("FILENAME")
if (filename = "") {
... no file name in environment, what to do?
}

You could have someone do this for the user, if he is not familiar with ?
the process.

Hi

your message is rather scrambled and to be honest not well understandable (by me).

having two column matrix

> mat<-matrix(1:8, 4,2)
> mat
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    5
[2,]    2    6
[3,]    3    7
[4,]    4    8

You can calculate eg. distance

> dist(mat, diag=T, upper=T)
         1        2        3        4
1 0.000000 1.414214 2.828427 4.242641
2 1.414214 0.000000 1.414214 2.828427
3 2.828427 1.414214 0.000000 1.414214
4 4.242641 2.828427 1.414214 0.000000

But from your description I do not understand how you want to reshape your data.

Example, please.

Subject: [R] How to import sensitive data when multiple users
	collaborate on	R-script?

Assume everyone will begin their work in a suitable working directory for their computer. Put data in that working directory or some directory "near" it. Then use relative paths to the data instead of absolute paths (don't use paths that start with "/"). I usually start by reading in a "configuration" file that I keep customized for per computer, that includes such things as the names of files I want to analyze. Sometimes there is only one row in that file, other times I select one row on the fly to use.

Come again?!  8 factors at 4 levels each is 4^8 possible combinations!

I will reply in more detail off list, as this is OT for r-help.

I am not sure this is relevant or helpful, but see ?abbreviate, which
one can use to abbreviate long strings as labels (but only for
English-like languages, I believe).

Dear R users,



I am trying to calculate NAV of portfolio using Return.portfolio function in PerformanceAnalytics Package. I am having difficulties with how I should specify weight in the function.

I tried to replicate using fixed weights with rebalance_on = "months" by specifying weights explicitly. However, the returns I got were different



Below is the example of the code



# clear memory



rm(list=ls())



library(quantmod)

library(PerformanceAnalytics)



symbols = c(

  "SPY", # US equities, SP500

  "AGG"  # US bonds, Barclay Agg

)

getSymbols(symbols, from="1970-01-01" , to="2014-09-15")

x.P <- do.call(merge, lapply(symbols, function(x) {

  Cl(to.monthly(Ad(get(x)), drop.time = TRUE,

                indexAt='endof'))

}))

colnames(x.P) = paste0(symbols, ".Adjusted")

x.R <- na.omit(Return.calculate(x.P))



# Create a weights vector

w = c(.6,.4) # Traditional 60/40 Equity/Bond portfolio weights



# Create monthly weight

w_mon = x.R[endpoints(x.R, on="months")]

w_mon$SPY.Adjusted = 0.6

w_mon$AGG.Adjusted = 0.4



# Rebalance back to 60/40 proportion

result.months1 = Return.portfolio(x.R, weights=w, rebalance_on = "months", verbose=TRUE)

result.months2 = Return.portfolio(x.R, weights=w_mon, verbose=TRUE)



test1 = data.frame(BOP = result.months1$BOP.Value, EOP = result.months1$EOP.Value, Ret = x.R)

test2 = data.frame(BOP = result.months2$BOP.Value, EOP = result.months2$EOP.Value, Ret = x.R)



# Show input and result



w

head(w_mon)



head(test1)

head(test2)

We can see that even though test1 (from using rebalance_on) and test2 (from specifying weight) showed the same Ret.SPY.Adjusted and Ret.AGG.Adjusted.

The return that test 2 used in calculating EOP was from the next period. For example, for test2, EOP.SPY.Adjusted on 2003-10-31 (0.6065527) = BOP.SPY.Adjusted on 2003-10-31 (0.6000000) * Ret.SPY.Adjusted on 2003-11-28 (1+0.01092112)

Could you please suggest how should I set weight to get the same result as in test1?

Dear Prasad

If you want to use R to do statistics then statistical knowledge is 
essential. If you want to use R to do one of the many, many other things 
it can do then you only need knowledge of whichever of those is your target.

Many thanks for your feedback.

If I get the code for the waldtest right I can calculate the Chi2 and the F statistic using waldtest(). Can I use the waldtest() without using bread()/ estfun()? That is, I estimate the logit regression using glm() e.g. logit<-glm(...) and insert logit into the waldtest() function.

Does that work to get chi2 under HAC standard errors?

The bread()/estfun() methods enable application of vcovHAC(), kernHAC(),
NeweyWest(). This in turn enables the application of coeftest(),
waldtest(), or linearHypothesis() with a suitable vcov argument.

All of these give you different kinds of Wald tests with HAC covariances
including marginal tests of individual coefficients (coeftest) or global
tests of nested models (waldtest/linearHypothesis). The latter can serve
as replacement for the "chi-squared test". For pseudo-R-squared values I'm
not familiar with HAC-adjusted variants.

And I'm not sure whether there is a LaTeX export solution that encompasses
all of these aspects simultaneously.

In every activity, knowing something about it allows you to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. There are non-statistical uses of programming languages, so you could use it for domains you are familiar with. Or you could see some intriguing statistical analysis and study in that area to understand it so you can apply it.  The difficulty in such ad-hoc approaches to learning is that it can be inefficient and leave big holes in your knowledge. Of course, you may have limited options at this point, so inefficient may be better than not at all.  To minimize the risk of missing a significant point, you should try to be thorough in your self-study and use expert consultation if you are unsure. (This list is not a good venue for purely theoretical questions, but such venues like stats.stackexchange.com or your local university do exist.)

However, please don't apply R like a magic answers box, because you can mislead others and cause harm.

There are lots of ways to handle this kind of thing, and the other

output of

  Sys.info()

in particular
  Sys.info()['nodename']
  Sys.info()['user']

I'm not sure what you mean here but I include a worked example. Caveat: 
The data I use are cross-section data with an overly simplified set of 
regressors. So none of this makes sense for the application - but it shows 
how to use the commands.

## load AER package which provides the example data
## and automatically loads "lmtest" and "sandwich"
library("AER")
data("PSID1976", package = "AER")

## fit a simple logit model and obtain marginal Wald tests
## for the coefficients and an overall chi-squared statistic
m <- glm(participation ~ education, data = PSID1976, family = binomial)
summary(m)
anova(m, test = "Chisq")

## replicate the same statistics with coeftest() and lrtest()
coeftest(m)
lrtest(m)

## the likelihood ratio test is asymptotically equivalent
## to the Wald test leading to a similar chi-squared test here
waldtest(m)

## obtain HAC-corrected (Newey-West) versions of the Wald tests
coeftest(m, vcov = NeweyWest)
waldtest(m, vcov = NeweyWest)

Instead of NeweyWest other covariance estimators (e.g., vcovHAC, kernHAC, 
etc.) can also be plugged in.

Thanks for response.. I want to merge two data frames using "within"
function..the columns to used for merge could vary.. then the other
commands become simpler..

Thanks so much for your help!

What is complicated about merge( q, r )?

Keep in mind that there is nothing simple about the rules for non-standard evaluation of variables that within() uses, and it only gets more complicated if you try to apply those rules to two data frames at once. While I am not quite sure I understand what you really want, I suspect you won't like the behavior you get when you pile too much context into within(). 

Note that dplyr::inner_join, which is designed to fit into a whole ecosystem of NSE functions, uses strings to specify column names to join by just like the merge "by" parameters do rather than using NSE, because it is actually the least confusing approach when two data frames are being referenced.

I agree that performing merge outside the scope of "within" function, is
pretty straight forward.. At times there are situations when many, if not
all, of the operations are needed to be done within the scope the "within"
environment..

Thanks so much..

Santosh

Then perhaps your example should illustrate one of these "many situations" that trouble you but you are not being clear about.

I am using VARS (vector autoregressive model). The process gets killed
after running for sometime. Following is the output of R.

That makes perfect sense.  Thank you, Michael.  I take your point about not
chasing the data and definitely see the risks involved in doing so.  Our
hypothesis was that the first, second and fourth variables would be
significant, but the third one (intervention) would not be.  I will
double-check the dataset to make sure that there are not any errors and
will report the results as we see them.  I much appreciate you taking the
time!

Best wishes,
Dan

Hi,
I am exactly replicating the SEM model which was done in SAS using Proc Calis in R.
Used sem package in R but not getting the GFI as same as in SAS (approximately 15% difference)
and also one link is insignificant but in SAS am getting significant.
Searched through online in different blogs but not able to get the solution.
Please let me know what might be the reason.
Thanks,Vinay

Standard reply (see posting guide):

Update to the current version of R (3.3.0 or so) and retry. Your
version is old -- this often leads to incompatibilities with newer
software versions.

Cheers,

Subject: [R] R getting "Killed" while running VAR model

Wild guess: You have huge and high dimensional VAR models, i.e. the 
matrices get huge and you use huge amounts of memory and you use more 
than what is available physically. The operating system protects itself 
by killing processes in such a case...

Best,

That is **not** a legitimate scientific hypothesis. Post to a
statistical list like stats.stackexchange.com to learn why not.

Subject: [R]  Searching for antilog function
In-Reply-To: <loom.20041125T051716-875@post.gmane.org>
References: <loom.20041125T051716-875@post.gmane.org>

The following function can do the work as well

  antilog<-function(lx,base)
  {
  lbx<-lx/log(exp(1),base=base)
  result<-exp(lbx)
  result
  }

This solution is based on the change of base formula which states that :

log (x,base=b) = log(x,base=a)/log(b,base=a)

The original logarithm is changed into natural logarithm and then the 
exponential function is employed

The arguments are:

'lx', de logarithm we have.
'base', the base what was employed to obtain lx

For example:

log(78,10) = 1.892095

Then the antllog is

antilog(1.892095,10)

78

As expected.
