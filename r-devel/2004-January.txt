Subject: [Rd] Doc bug in ?legend on using bg if bty = "o" / "n" (PR#6294)
Message-ID: <20040102132652.5D4FC10469@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

In ?legend (R-1.8.1 and R-devel), Section "Arguments", there is a 
documentation bug:

"bg  the background color for the legend box. (Note that this is only
used if bty = "n".)"

Instead, it is used if bty = "o", but *not* if bty = "n".

Ok, seems to have worked, give or take a couple of formatting errors.

Subject: [Rd] termplot; failure to subset non-dataframe carriers (PR#6327)
Message-ID: <20040104020725.D904E1045C@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

termplot() does not carry subsetting over to carriers that
are in the environment but not in the data frame.  This
generates a "subscript out of bounds" error.

 > data(ToothGrowth)
 > logdose <- log(ToothGrowth$dose)

 > termplot(toothVC2.lm)  ## Works fine
 > toothVC.lm <- lm(len ~ logdose, data=ToothGrowth,

        ylab = ylabs[i], xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims, main = main[i],
        col = col.term, lwd = lwd.term, ...)
2: plot(xx[oo], tms[oo, i], type = "l", xlab = xlabs[i], ylab =  
ylabs[i],
        xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims, main = main[i], col = col.term,
        lwd = lwd.term, ...)
1: termplot(toothVC.lm)

Because logdose is not in the data frame ToothGrowth, it was not  
subsetted.
Pending better suggestions, I offer the following fix:

Replace the lines:
     if (NROW(tms) < NROW(data))
         data <- data[dimnames(tms)[[1]], ]

by

     if (NROW(tms) < NROW(data)) {
         use.rows <- match(dimnames(tms)[[1]], dimnames(data)[[1]])
         data <- data[use.rows,  ]
     }
     else use.rows <- NULL

Then following

             xx <- carrier(cn[[i]])
add:

             if(!is.null(use.rows))xx <- xx[use.rows]

Alternatively, the (conditional) subsetting may be included
within the function carrier()

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
-------------
This may be a good time to mention that I'd like to be able to
add a smooth to the points that appear when partial.resid=TRUE.
One mechanism would be to allow as argument a panel function that
can be set to panel.smooth.  (The default might be NULL).
I'll forward a more detailed suggestion to r-devel.

Subject: [Rd] non-generic functions
Message-ID: <OF75BDC5D8.88BD3A60-ON85256E12.0050FA52@bd.com>

Hi,

I'm writing some code that will eventually see its way to a package (I
hope). I've noticed that some functions are not set up using generic
methods (while similar functions are). For example, mean is a generic
method but var is not. Other operations that I've come across that could
benefit from being generic are: qqplot, cor, cov, optimize/optimise.

For example, if one were developing a control charting package, it be great
to simply use sd(object), where object is of course the appropriate class,
to get the standard deviation of the process as estimated be the charting
method. Similarly, a DOE package might include optimize(object) to find the
optimal operating conditions based on the data and specifications in
object.

Just a thought,

Max

If you use S4 classes/methods you can "create" generics by just calling

setGeneric("sd")

for example, and the original function becomes the default method.  Then 
you can define appropriate methods for your objects.

Subject: [Rd] Boost Protein Expression by Codon Optimization (PR#6383)
Message-ID: <20040106001349.96B891045E@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

Dear Colleague,

Happy New Year!

As we know, codon preference among different species could be dramatically different.  To enhance the expression level of a foreign protein in a particular expression system (E.coli, Yeast, Insect, or Mammalian cell), it is very important to adjust the codon frequency of the foreign protein to match that of the host expression system.  One classic example is GFP (green fluorescent protein) which was optimized to achieve high-level of expression in mammalian cells. 

GenScript has developed a proprietary algorithm for codon optimization.  This algorithm can optimize sequences for protein expression using either your own codon usage table or those from publicly available codon usage database.  It can converts your amino acid sequence into a DNA sequence with overall codon usage similar to a specified organism, and also optimizes the RNA secondary structure, GC content, repetitive codons etc. Using Genscript optimized synthetic genes, many of our customers have reported dramatic increase on protein expression. 

The optimized gene can be synthesized by GenScript gene synthesis technology with 100% fidelity.  The cost is as low as $2.35 per base pair.  Our service is very flexible, we can clone the optimized gene into our standard vectors (without extra charge), or any expression vector that you provide (for $400 extra charge).

Gene synthesis is a powerful technology and it has many other applications.  Another application example is to replace PCR Cloning.  Please visit our web (http://www.genscript.com/gene_synthesis.html) to learn more about this technology.  

Besides Gene Synthesis, we also provide custom vector-based siRNA, siRNA cassette, peptide, oligo, cloning and protein expression, biochemical reagents, and labwares.  Please visit our web site (http://www.genscript.com) to learn more about our services.

na.exclude.default() in src/library/base/R/nafns.R in 1.8.1 and stats/R/nafns.R
in devel copies na.omit.default() and sets:

	attr(omit, "class") <- "omit"

while na.exclude.data.frame() sets the class to "exclude" as advertised. This

is abstracted from the appendix on mixed models from my R and S-PLUS Companion:

 > set.seed(12345)  # for reproducibility
 > library(nlme)
Loading required package: lattice
 > data(MathAchieve)
 > data(MathAchSchool)
 > attach(MathAchieve)
 > mses <- tapply(SES, School, mean)
 > detach(MathAchieve)
 > Bryk <- as.data.frame(MathAchieve[, c("School", "SES", "MathAch")])
 > names(Bryk) <- c("school", "ses", "mathach")
 > sample20 <- sort(sample(7185, 20))
 > Bryk$meanses <- mses[as.character(Bryk$school)]
 > Bryk[sample20,]
Error in as.data.frame.default(x[[i]], optional = TRUE) :
         can't coerce array into a data.frame
 >

This is with R 1.8.1 under Windows 2000. The same code works fine with R 
1.8.0. As Dirk discovered, the problem disappears if the assignment

Bryk$meanses <- mses[as.character(Bryk$school)]

is changed to

Bryk$meanses <- as.vector(mses[as.character(Bryk$school)])

It seems to me that it if $ doesn't want to coerce the array 
mses[as.character(Bryk$school)] to a vector (as I guess was previously the 
case), then the error should have been produced at that point.

Thanks,
  John

Subject: [Rd] problem assigning an array to a variable in a data frame
In-Reply-To: <5.1.0.14.2.20040107172840.01fef4b0@127.0.0.1>

The problem is not in $ but in printing the resulting object (try
traceback()).  You assigned a column which is a one-dimensional array:

> unlist(sapply(sample20, class))
  school1   school2       ses   mathach   meanses 
"ordered"  "factor" "numeric" "numeric"   "array" 

I presume you did not actually intend to do this?

The `problem' is in the use of tapply, which does something different here
from its S counterpart: in R you need to surround its result by drop().  
In R <= 1.8.0 subsetting a 1-d array dropped the dimensions, which was a
bug, and you were saved by a fortuitous subsetting.

But what $ does in R is compatible with S:

X <- data.frame(x=1:10)
y <- array(1:10, dim=10)
X$y <- y
sapply(X, class)

for which both give integer, array.

However, R's print method is deficient and so the error message is in
precisely the right place.  (S does have an array method for
as.data.frame, and since S4 classes were introduced into R, R needs one.)

Message-ID: <8CBAA121CEB4D5118CB200508BB2BBEF05BF73F4@xmx8lonib.lonib.commerzbank.com>

I have encountered an issue which I have been unable to resolve, involving
an S3 generic (print) being declared S4 generic in a package, and the method
being exported.  This all works fine - the problem occurs when I try to
import the method to another package.

Here is the bit that works fine. -------------

#the .r file for package bar

setClass("bar",representation("numeric"))

if(!isGeneric("print")) {setGeneric("print",useAsDefault=print)}
setMethod("print",signature(x="bar"),
    print.bar <- function(x,...)
        {
        print("print method for bar")
        print(x@.Data,...)
        }
    )

if(!isGeneric("barprint")) {setGeneric("barprint",useAsDefault=print)}
setMethod("barprint",signature(x="bar"),
    printBar <- function(x,...)
        {
        print("barprint method for bar")
        print(x@.Data,...)
        }
    )

#the NAMESPACE file for package bar

import(methods)
exportMethods(barprint,print)
exportClasses("bar")

#then in R:

> require(barpkg)
Loading required package: barpkg 
[1] TRUE
> x <- new("bar",99)
> print(x)
[1] "print method for bar"
[1] 99
> barprint(x)
[1] "barprint method for bar"
[1] 99

Fine.

Here is the bit that I have not figured out. -------------

#the .r file for package waz

wazbar <- function(x)
    {
    barprint(new("bar",x))
    }

#the NAMESPACE file for package waz

import(methods,barpkg)
importMethodsFrom(barpkg)
importClassesFrom(barpkg)
export(wazbar)

#then in R

> require(wazpkg)
Loading required package: wazpkg 
[1] TRUE
> wazbar(99)
Error in .setMethodsForDispatch(f, fdef, resetMlist) : 
        Internal error: did not get a valid generic function object for
function "print"
Error in print("barprint method for bar") : 
        S language method selection got an error when called from internal
dispatch for function "print"

end of R bit ---------------------------

The problem goes away if I don't set print as an S4 generic in bar.

Can anyone help - maybe an error is obvious?  

As a bit of background, I am package maintainer for its (Irregular
Time-Series), and have been obliged to put it in a namespace or suffer a
significant performance penalty (about 6x slower).  In the package I make S3
generics (plot, print, summary etc) S4 generic in this package, and so far
have not got into trouble for doing so.  However, I have now got stuck -
possibly I have not seen the right documentation (I refer to the newsletter
article, and John Chambers' correspondence on R-devel early September).

I believe you should not be doing that.  The S4 generic for displaying
objects is show() and not print().  This matters because auto-printing
will use show() rather than print().

The other thing I noticed is that you have `import(methods)'.  That is
dangerous, as loading the methods namespace without attaching the package
is known to have problems.  (Take a look at how package mle does this.)
One reason it is dangerous is the following:

R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL R
> loadedNamespaces()
[1] "base"
> .isMethodsDispatchOn()
[1] FALSE
> loadNamespace("methods")
<environment: namespace:methods>
> .isMethodsDispatchOn()
[1] TRUE
> loadedNamespaces()
[1] "base"    "methods"
> library(MASS)
> detach("package:MASS")
[1] TRUE
> .isMethodsDispatchOn()
[1] FALSE

so if you only load the methods namespace, any call to detach() switches 
off methods dispatch!   That is not the only problem which has been noted.

Thanks for the tips so far.  I have modified the example so that 

(a) I do not define an S4 method for print [I use summary instead, which
gets similar treatment in mle as far as I can see]

(b) I do not do use the 'import(methods)' directive  [I previously did this
because John Chambers explicitly and as point number 1 stated that this was
required, in his email dated 6th September - actually I seem to get the same
results either way]

Nevertheless I get the same behaviour when trying to access a generic method
defined in one package [barpkg in my example] and imported into a second
package [wazpkg in my example].  If I require() the package I get the
behaviour I expect.

Right -- I understood that meanses is a one-dimensional array, though I

You're caught in a subtle "gotcha" with the combination of things you're
doing.  We're trying to sort out some of the interactions among
namespace & methods at the moment, so there may be a nicer solution in
the future.  Meanwhile, I can tell you the problem and suggest various
work-arounds.

The basic problem is that by importing barpkg, rather than requiring it,
the generic version of "print" is not seen from the recursive call to
print inside the S4 method for class "bar".  (It's possible this is just
a simple bug, but the thread of environments is a bit tricky at this
point.)

Here's a dump (using options(error=recover)) of your example
(NameSpace4==wazpkg, NameSpace3==barpkg)

So only the S3 version of print on base is seen at this juncture. 
Hence, crash.

This leads to the first work-around: require(barpkg) (e.g., in a .onLoad
function for wazpkg)

R> require(NameSpace3)
Loading required package: NameSpace3 
[1] TRUE
R> wazbar(99)
[1] "barprint method for bar"
[1] 99

(because the S4 generic for print is now in the search path).

Other probable workarounds (haven't tried them out):

- force S4 generics for print, etc. in the wazbar package as well.

- don't make S3 generics on base into S4 generics.

Message-ID: <x2brpegwqf.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


As some may have noticed, the incoming box on r-bugs was getting
contaminated with about 40 times more spam than regular bug reports.
Since I had more important things to do this week (nothing like
evations to get some things done...) I finally got spamassassin and
procmail set up. Looks like that has pretty much stopped the traffic. 

There is some risk, probably quite low, that this might catch regular
reports and whereas I do collect the rejects, I'm not likely to check
them with any regularity. If this happens to you, please rewrite to
make the report less spam-like... In particular, check that you are
not sending HTML contents.

  Ah, so that's why my report of a bug in the RCheapViagra package 
didn't get through....

  Actually, I hope that's not sufficent to trigger spamassassin - oh 
well, only one way to find out. Well done Peter anyway for setting this up.

Subject: [Rd] debugging strange segfault
Message-ID: <3A822319EB35174CA3714066D590DCD504AF75D5@usrymx25.merck.com>

Dear R-devel,

Can anyone give me some hints on how to go about debugging a strange
segfault in my randomForest package?  Here's the scoop:

A user reported segfault when running predict() in the randomForest package.
I asked for the data and code.  The combination runs fine under WinXPPro,
but does give segfault on one of our Linux boxes running R (1.7.0 through
R-devel_2004-01-08) on Mandrake 9.0. 

The predict.randomForest() function calls a C function "runforest" via
.C(..., DUP=FALSE, ...), which in turns calls a Fortran subroutine
"testreebag" within a for loop.  The segfault seems to occur right after
finishing the runforest() function in C and returning to R.  I inserted the
line:

Rprintf("Done!\n");

as the last line of the runforest() function and got the following output:

> library(randomForest, lib.loc="~/rlibs")
> arabid <- read.table('arabidopsis.out', sep=' ', header=T)
> arabid <- arabid[,-which(names(arabid) == "X0")]
> set.seed(1)
> fit <- randomForest(arabid[,-1], arabid[,1], ntree=100)
> predict(fit, arabid[,-1])
Done!

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x40152a48 in malloc () from /lib/libc.so.6

[If I change the DUP=FALSE in the .C() call to TRUE, I get the following:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x080b412b in Rf_duplicate (s=0x1) at duplicate.c:75
75          switch (TYPEOF(s)) {
]

At this point I'm clueless as to what to do next, and would very much
appreciate any help!

Best,
Andy

The symptom is that of the compiled code overrunning the storage it was 
allocated.  I tracked down an instance (in SuppDists) yesterday and have 
seen quite a few in my time.

I would expect you to find a write to memory off one or other end of an
array, and compiling with bounds checking in place *may* help.  (g77 is
less useful than some commercial Fortran compilers at this, and some
people write code that cannot be checked.)

Increasing some storage areas for output arrays will often make the 
problem go away, but it is not actually a solution since it may just 
relocate an illegal write to a non-fatal place.

Hope that helps enough,

Brian

I'm not sure if I don't get the clue, but please consider this:

The behaviour is the same with R1.7.1 on Window2000 as on a R1.8.1 on sunOS
5.8.

Please do read the R FAQ and don't misuse R-bugs to ask questions.

Hint: you most likely specified a non-existent time.  When did your locale
switch to DST in 1993?  I don't know, of course (you haven't told us your
locale) but I bet it was that day.  That means the time you specified does
not exist if your locale switched at the same time as the UK (and I bet it
did).

Here's my evidence (WinXP)

So it is probably intended, then!

Thanks to DTL, BDR, KH and RG, I've found and fixed the bug.  The problem
was that I was offsetting an array being passed from C to Fortran, when I
shouldn't have.  Valgrind pinpointed the line that caused the trouble.  When
I found the bug, it makes me wonder why the code ever worked...

[I've just submitted the patched version to CRAN.]

return() is not documented.

It should also be mentioned in the R Reference section for function().
Apparently the last result of a function is the return value from a function,
except when the function is terminated with a return() with an argument.

No, it is documented: on the same help page as function()!
Try ?return.

See the "Details" Section of ?return.

Also, there s no "Reference" Section, but a "References" Section for 
citing articles and books (not help pages), and a "See Also" Section for 
citing help pages, but it doesn't make sense to cite the help page itself.

?return  does give the correct page, and the "Details" section
does talk about this,  right ?

Eh??? What does help(return) say on your system? Mine has

Usage:

     function( arglist ) expr
     return(value)
......
     If 'value' is missing, 'NULL' is returned.  If it is a single
     expression, the value of the evaluated expression is returned.

     If the end of a function is reached without calling 'return', the
     value of the last evaluated expression is returned.

Oh.
It didn't occur to me to ask help(), which I could have because I know
what I need.
I was looking at the R Language Definition (draft).

Excuse me for a moment.  A moment which you won't notice, as I must
build a time machine and change my bug report to "not documented in the
R Language Definition (draft)".

Full_Name: Jeff Litwiller
Version: 1.8.1
OS: Windows 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (192.160.186.181)


biplot() does not work on objects of mode prcomp.  Even though the documentation
and release notes indicate that it should.

To get biplot() to work on prcomp objects I had to do the following:

1) Add the following line to "R\rw1081\library\mva\NAMESPACE":

S3method(biplot, prcomp)

2) Make the following change to "\R\rw1081\library\mva\R\mva":

change "x$loadings" to "x$rotation"

Note, the same fixes needed to be applied to 1.8.0.

You are presumably hitting the switch from dayligh-saving to regular time in
that year.

I was just mucking about with that, but R (1.9.0 as of Jan 8, 2004, on
Debian unstable) still crashes reliably even when I explicitly set the TZ
variable (and it also crashed for TZ=GMT):

> Sys.getenv("TZ")
TZ
""
> Sys.putenv("TZ"="CDT6CST")
> Sys.getenv("TZ")
       TZ
"CDT6CST"

Not nice. I wrote some code to transfer time stamps from one time zone to
another, but that sits at work right now and I can't get to it...

Subject: [Rd] Top 10 R Features
Message-ID: <20040111163302.581953960@mprdmxin.myway.com>


It seems to be the time of the year for top 10 lists both
looking backwards
(e.g. films: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3660638/ )
and forwards
(e.g. trends: http://www.wfs.org/forecasts.htm )

In this light I think we need a list of the top 10 features
that users think R needs.    Some of these are concrete while
others are vague.  By R, I am referring to the entire R system
including packages, not just the core.

Anyone have other ideas on this?

By the way, I think R is a really powerful system with an 
amazing community constantly enhancing the core and contributing 
new packages so I hope this will be viewed constructively and not 
as criticism.

The following are in no particular order:

1. GUI.  See http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/  
Its hard to specify this one closely but the above link discusses
it and various approaches.

2. Timezone-free dates in the core.  POSIXt is great for file
stamps and certain esoteric applications (e.g. world currency
arbitrage) but for the most part it needlessly complicates 
most statistical analyses and is error prone so a second
system is needed for common use. 

3. A guide to the source.  One of the most powerful aspects of
R is that you get the whole source.  It would be nice to have 
a tour of this.

4. A really good reference card.  Something along the lines of
the Visibone javascript reference card (www.visibone.com) which
is so packed full of much information you can't believe they
got in into a few pages or the Werbach html barebones guide
(www.werbach.com/barebones/).  I am aware of a few reference
cards ( http://www.psych.upenn.edu/%7Ebaron/refcard.pdf
http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/cheatsheet 
http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/doc/statsRus.html )
which are all good but I think even more would be possible.

5. Boundary conditions.  Anyone who has used APL for a period
of time and then come to R will know what I mean by this one.
In APL you can write code and find that it works on boundary
conditions (null objects, etc.) in the correct way an amazing
percentage of the time.  This is not the case with R.  Its
hard for me to pinpoint what's wrong here but its a feeling from
having used the two systems.

6. SAS style output-it-all-at-once commands.  Hmisc and Design
already have some of this but more is needed.  These commands
could be in a separate package or in the core.

7. More use of objection orientation.  R has the capability to
support this but at the next level up its not used as much as
it could be.  Could character patterns (file name globbing, 
fixed character sequences with no regular expression 
subcommands, basic POSIX regular expressions, extended 
POSIX regular expressions, Perl regular expressions) be 
generalized into classes, for example?

8. Generalization, consolidation and regulariation of commands.  
With a large number of contributors there is opportunity for 
generalization and consolidation of commands.  Could the various 
apply commands be generalized and consolidated, for example? This
point is probably related to #7.

9. Harness the community.  There is a large community using R now.
The mailing lists provide some interaction and the package system
provides a way for them to contribute code; but a wiki or some
similar method of harnessing comments and experiences would be
nice.    A wiki does exist at
http://fawn.unibw-hamburg.de/cgi-bin/Rwiki.pl?RwikiHome
but its unused so something more than just the technical provision
of the software seems necessary.  The mailing list even discussed 
the possibility of integrating the help system with a wiki.  Or
maybe there is some other solution.

10.  Some facilities to make it easy to write single file simple 
self contained filters in R in the same way you can with perl 
and awk.

And the bug is in glibc, not R (the segfault is in strftime in libc).  
It works perfectly on Solaris:

[1] "1993-08-07 01:50:00 CST"

and on Windows (where that is not a valid time zone so I used mine).

[1] "1993-08-07 01:50:00 GMT Daylight Time"

Presumably glibc has some undocumented assumption that we are not 
fulfilling, but I am by now very tired of the bugs in its date-time code.

I've found the glibc bug.  Looking at the gdb output

(gdb) print tm
$1 = {tm_sec = 0, tm_min = 50, tm_hour = 1, tm_mday = 7, tm_mon = 7,
  tm_year = 93, tm_wday = 6, tm_yday = 218, tm_isdst = 1,
  __tm_gmtoff = 138337816, __tm_zone = 0x1 <Address 0x1 out of bounds>}

Now __tm_zone is not a POSIX field, and it is not documented in time.h 
either.  Yet strftime.c in glibc 2.3.2 includes

  zone = NULL;
#if HAVE_TM_ZONE
  /* The POSIX test suite assumes that setting
     the environment variable TZ to a new value before calling strftime()
     will influence the result (the %Z format) even if the information in
     TP is computed with a totally different time zone.
     This is bogus: though POSIX allows bad behavior like this,
     POSIX does not require it.  Do the right thing instead.  */
  zone = (const char *) tp->tm_zone;
#endif
#if HAVE_TZNAME
  if (ut)
    {
      if (! (zone && *zone))
        zone = "GMT";
    }

so it looks at the field even though there is no reason why it should be 
set according to POSIX or ISO C. If one NULLs it, the code behaves 
correctly.  Note that strptime in the same version of glibc does not set 
it, hence the problem.

The extra field seems to have been around since 1996-09-11, so I think a
test for glibc >= 2.0 is safe here.

It turned out this was indeed just a bug ("simple" might be an
exaggeration).  A quick fix should be available in r-devel now, a more
thorough fix will arrive later--the difference being mainly to make
dispatch a little faster.

(The bug was a result of the function being called coming from base,
causing the dispatch code to look for the generic, but in the wrong
environment.)

Subject: [Rd] automatic "paste" filter to paste only the commands from a
 transcript on the clipboard
Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.2.20040113093145.037c3480@mailhost.blackmesacapital.com>

Just for fun (and actually because I would use it too) I wrote a
version of the "paste" menu command that assumes the clipboard
contains a transcript, and just pastes the commands from it into
the R console window (Windows GUI only).

So, if something like this:

 > foo <-
+ 33
 > foo * 3
[1] 99
 > foo
[1] 33

is on the clipboard, then the "paste commands" menu command will just paste

foo <-
33
foo * 3
foo

into the console window. (Resulting in this case in the original contents
of the clipboard being reproduced in the console window.)

Is anyone interested in having this functionality in R?

If there's enough interest in this to incorporate it into R, I'll package it
up as a patch (I did it in R 1.8.1).  (BTW, I only implemented it for the
Windows GUI, but it was pretty simple, so I'm sure if there's much
interest someone could easily port it to other GUIs).

A similar item exists in ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics): "M-x
ess-clean-transcript" or thereabouts. Much loved by those who know it
is there.

A version that works on the contents of a Tk text widget might not be
a half bad idea to have.

Yup, I use a version in Emacs -- didn't know about the ESS
version, so I wrote my own... :-(.  I use it all the time and I have
it bound globally to C-x M-w so that I can use it from a buffer of
any mode.  However, it's a little cumbersome to go via Emacs
when pasting from other applications.  That's why I proposed a
version that could work within R.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0401151010100.2639-100000@gannet.stats>

I would like to deprecate La.eigen.  It is used in a few packages
(ade4, fpc, gss, mvtnorm and smoothSurv on CRAN), but only in usages where 
replacing `La.eigen' by `eigen' would call exactly the same code.

The reason for wanting to deprecate it is that little-used interfaces tend
to get overlooked, e.g. PR#5406, a report on eigen, needed to be applied
to La.eigen as well.  We have also fixed NaNs issues in eigen but not
La.eigen.

Does anyone have code that uses the extra features of eigen?

Brian

Oops: of La.eigen, that is the `method' argument.

Why do you claim that your answer is the correct one? You have not scaled

          scaled to have unit variance before the analysis takes place.

Eh? I may be not quite up to speed on my PCA theory, but I fail to see
why you should expect to have any relation between prcomp(..., scale=T)
and an SVD of the covariance matrix. What you do have is

Could it be possible for packages to have manuals in multiple

I'm not saying all manuals should be in multiple languages, but
I think there should be a mechanism for package writers to add
manuals in multiple languages, if they think it useful.

It seems that R (unlike S-plus) allows assignments to elements of a 
vector objects even when the object do not exists locally (inside a 
fucntion) in cases where an object of the same name exists globally.  I 
guess this is not really desired behaviour:


R v1.8.0

 > testfunc()
Error in testfunc() : Object "a" not found
 > a<-2
 > testfunc()
[1] 1
 > a
[1] 2


S-plus v6.0
 > a
Problem: Object "a" not found
 > testfunc <- function() {a[1]<-1; a}
 > testfunc()
Problem in testfunc(): Object "a" not found
Use traceback() to see the call stack

Problem in testfunc(): object "a" must be assigned locally before 
replacement
Use traceback() to see the call stack

Please don't post things as bugs unless you're reasonably sure they're
bugs.  This is a difference between R and S-PLUS.

It's well documented that R and S-PLUS have different scoping rules
(see 3.3.1"Lexical Scoping" in the FAQ), but I don't think that's
coming into play here.  

What we have is a reference to a global variable that modifies it.
For some reason S-PLUS doesn't allow that, but R does.  Why do you
think it's a bug in R?

Some versions of S-PLUS do not allow it, and others do, so hardly a basis 
for claiming a bug in R.

Subject: [Rd] Another wishlist for R 
Message-ID: <200401161746.JAA14274@eskimo.com>

First, a big thanks to all of the developers and users that have worked to
make R such useful software.  It is only because I find the software so useful
that I have the following opinions.

A recent post to R-devel listed the 'Top 10 Features' for one person.  I found
it to be quite an interesting read.  Over the past couple of years I have
assembled my own lists.

Retrospective.  Some of my favorite things I like about R (vs. S-Plus)

1. Integration with emacs
2. Nice color handling
3. Wealth of packages, easy package updates
4. HTML help
5. More answers on R-news than S-help
6. Active developer community
7. Package creation tools
8. Functions: setwd, with, apropos

Prospective.  Periodically David Smith at Insightful asks users, "If you had
$100, how would you allocate that money to development?"  Without listing
dollar amounts, these are my personal choices for R.

1. Add "head" and "tail" to R base.  
   Patrick Burns has these: http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/public.html#genutil
   Very handy functions for checking data manipulation.

2. Strive for self-contained examples in all .Rd files (as far as possible).
   Generally quite good, but there's always room for improvement.
   For R base, If I create examples, to whom should I send them (R-devel?) and
   how (request for change?).
   Here's one example (by P. Dalgaard) for function 'replace'
     # Replace in a data frame NA?s with -1? 
     dd <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,NA,4),b=c(NA,2,3,4)) 
     dd[] <- lapply(dd,function(x) replace(x, is.na(x), -1)) 

3. Encourage (more) standards for function names.  
   A prominent link on CRAN to the coding conventions would be good.
   Here is a draft of coding conventions:
     http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/RCC/
   Partly as a result of the community development of R, the names of
   functions lack consistency.  Consider the following examples: 
     row.names, rownames
     browseURL, contrib.url, fixup.package.URLs
     package.contents, packageStatus
     mahalanobis, TukeyHSD
     getMethod, getS3method
   The sooner that conventions are encouraged, the more consistent future
   function names will be.

4. Increased integration of text and graphics output (for PDF, in particular).
   Sweave is fantastic for quality reporting, but can be a lot of work
   when a quick analysis is all that is needed.
   Often I would like to do something like print a box plot and include an
   anova table, for example: 
     pdf("file")
     boxplot(y~x)
     frame()
     sink.to.pdf()
     frame()
     anova(lm(y~x))
     sink()
     dev.off()
   I know of no such (simple) tools.  Ben Bolker has a an idea here: 
     http://maths.newcastle.edu.au/~rking/R/help/02b/4179.html

5. Drop unused factor levels by default.  (At least as a settable option.) 
   This issue has been debated before--I'm just adding my vote and justification.
   The proportion of time I want data to include unused factor levels is close
   to zero.  The amount of time I spend cleaning data to get rid of unused
   factor levels is quite substantial.

6. Expanded font control for graphics devices.
   This is already being considered, so again I'm just adding my vote.  See:
   http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/fonts.html
   
7. Clean up namespace implementation
   The introduction of namespaces has (for me) been a nuisance without
   any benefits that I am aware of.  I speak as a user, not a package maintainer. 
   I would like to see (1) more education about namespace benefits, (2) more
   discussions about what is the appropriate role for namespaces and (3) 
   improvements to the documentation, which is now often less correct (if not
   broken) due to namespaces.  For example, help(is.function) doesn't say how
   functions hidden behind namespaces will be treated.  Most help files
   completely ignore issues with namespaces.  
   Some people will say, "of course namespaces are working exactly as
   expected"!  But that is only true if you expect functions to be 
   hidden...quite a few versions of R trained users otherwise.
   The quiet introduction of namespaces has broken my modus operandi for:
     args(predict.lme)
     is.function(predict.lme)
     predict.lme(object)
     exists("predict.lme")
   Namespaces may be neat/right from a language-design perspective, but have
   made it more frustrating for me to actually use the software. 

8. More consistency in the use of na.action and na.rm.
   Compare: mean(..., na.rm= ...) lme(..., na.action=... )
   Maybe na.action could be added to 'mean' and other functions.
   There are issues of compatability with S-Plus here...

9. Add 'substitute' to getAnywhere 
   Acutally, the code for getAnywhere already contains 'substitute', so it
   looks like the author intended for the function to work without a quoted
   argument. That would be wonderful.  Then why does
   getAnywhere("predict.lme") work but getAnywhere(predict.lme) does not work? 
   (Yet another namespace issue)

   I'm not the first person to ask this question.  Obviously I'm
   a member of the "blind" population that can't read help files:
     http://maths.newcastle.edu.au/~rking/R/help/03b/0760.html
   Another possibility is that the help file could be clearer for us blind
   folk that interpret "x: a character string or name" to mean that
   x might not be a character string. (See the help page) 

10. More uniformity in quoting arguments.
    Uniformity outweighs cleverness/exceptions ("The Art of Unix Programming").
    Functions accepting non-quoted arguments
      is.function(obj)
      args(predict)
      rm(a)
      help(help)
      find(replace) or find("replace")
    Functions requiring quoted arguments
      get("help")
      exists("predict.lme")       

    Some people have claimed "the designers of S knew what they were
    doing"  because you can do clever things like this:
        i="help"
        exists(i)   
    But we could just as easily be doing other clever things 
    and have more uniform quoting rules.  S is probably too mature for this to
    really be considered.

11. Have 'aggregate' add logical/default names to its value.
    I'm basically echoing this thread:
        http://maths.newcastle.edu.au/~rking/R/help/03b/7517.html
    Using aggregate(x,by,FUN), I would find it very useful if the factor names in
    the "by" list carried through to the final aggregate data.frame.  Also,
    when 'x' is a vector (and maybe for other data structures), it would be
    nice to have the original names included in the result.

12. Wanted: General-purpose mixed-models function/package
    The nlme library is very nice for mixed-effects models with nested
    effects, but it is not very general-purpose.  Even Bates/Pinheiro have said
    several times in posts to R-help/S-news that nlme was designed for nested
    models and using other models can be hard.
      Bates: "highly unintuitive" (crossed effects model)
      Bates: "algorithms for lme are tuned for nested random effects"
    For example, in nlme,
      The syntax for crossed random effects is quite intimidating
      Try removing the variance component for Rep in: random=~1|Rep/WholePlot.
      Try changing an nested effect from random to fixed (or vice-versa).
      Try to extract lsmeans for fixed-effects in a model.
      Try to do a multiple-comparison of fixed-effects estimates.
      Try using AR1xAR1 error structure.  The nlme library appears to have 
        tools for this, but again is syntactically difficult.  I can find no
        examples.
    Most of these tasks would ideally be straightforward in a general-purpose
    mixed-models function (as they are in SAS, Genstat, etc.)

    The ASREML software is available in S-Plus (and soon R, I'm told) via
    the proprietary 'samm' library.  Whereas lme seems excellent for basic
    nested-effects models and difficult for other models, samm excels at
    crossed-effects models, but doesn't have the plethora of useful 
    print, plot, extractor, and summary methods that are found in nlme.

13. The fantasy list.  Go ahead and tell me, "In your dreams!"
   
Deprecate 'update'.  Cute, but makes session transcripts hard to read.
Remove implicit intercepts in models.  Require y~1+x.  Force thinking about intercepts.
Lattice colors could be more saturated for printing and projecting
Rename 'prompt' to something closer to its purpose like makeSkeletonHelp

This is actually happening -- gradually these functions are losing the
ability to take both quoted and unquoted arguments. However, it's not a
matter of making them all the same.

is.function() and args() really shouldn't take quoted arguments -- the
argument is an object, not on the name of the object.  This is in contrast
to rm(), help(), and find(), where the argument really is the name of the
object.  One motivation for persuading people to type ?lm instead of
help(lm) is that it might then be possible to force help() to take quoted
arguments.

There's a similar issue with expressions as arguments. A few functions
such as with(), quote(), substitute(), capture.output() correctly take
unquoted expressions as arguments.  Most functions will use only the value
of an unquoted expression.  A number of modelling functions, however, use
unquoted expressions without evaluating them, and shouldn't.  It's
probably too late to stop this for functions like glm(), but at least new
modelling functions could avoid it.  There are notes about this issue at
http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf

Using fix(data.frame) causes an immediate bus error and crashes R.  This happens
regardless of the size of the data.frame and occurred in an earlier version of
RAqua as well.  This did not happen on an even earlier version of R I had
installed on this system (pre RAqua).  The crash takes place when using R with
X11--but not with RAqua.  I work more often with the X11 interface ...

The crossed random effects problem is also in the process of being fixed.
Our recent work on computational methods for mixed-effects models
        http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/reports/MixedComp.pdf
shows how to structure the calculations but it takes a long time to
get the code designed, implemented, debugged, debugged again, debugged
again, ..., documented, documented some more, documented some more,
debugged again, ...

I am hopeful that I will be able to come up with a single, unified
data structure, based on sparse matrices, that can be used for nested,
crossed, and partically crossed random effects.

At present I am doing a major redesign of the Matrix package to change
to S4 classes and methods and to incorporate sparse matrices.  Once
that is more-or-less stable (I expect a preliminary release by the end
of January) I will work on the implementation of the lme structures.

It is interesting that ASREML will be available for R.

Perhaps something like this?

<package>/help/<two letter code>

though, perhaps, you might actually want a more general

<package>/<two letter code>/help,html,etc

and then a locale option that specifies the preference of language 
availability (someone might prefer german, then french and then english 
or something like)?

I wondered what was meant by `manuals', but I assumed it was not the help 
system.  Some packages do have manuals, usually installed from inst/doc
(and there is a vignette mechanism to provide manuals of this type).

If you do mean help pages, there are questions of whether more than one 
language should be installed (and BTW the .Rd files are installed under 
man) and whether QC should check all of them, ....

If we are taking multi-language support seriously, we need to be thinking 
about Chinese, Japanese, ....  We don't currently have support for 
multi-byte encodings, although we are discussing it.  We tend to make 
manuals via latex/texinfo which AFAIK do not support multi-byte encodings 
(although projects to do so are under way).  One issue is that there is a 
move to multi-byte encoding (specifically UTF-8) even for Western European 
languages.

Kevin,

I was glad to see your list.  Some of the items were reasons for creating
some of the functions in Hmisc.  summarize and mApply in conjunction with
llist handle labeling of output - this is actually quite tricky and the
Hmisc solution isn't perfect.  Dropping unused factor levels by default
(with easy override) is an old battle and I agree with you completely that
for everyday data analysis I almost always want to do this.  But I haven't
been able to convince anyone else about that, despite repeated attempts. 
[.factor in Hmisc drops unused levels by default.  To be honest, the one
place I've gotten into trouble with this default occasionally is in
multiple panels in lattice related to consistent assignment of line styles
and symbols across strata when the "groups" variable has missing cells in
some panels.

I also share your views about namespaces.  These have caused numerous
problems for me.  It would be nice to have more of a mechanism to put
"feelers" out to the R user community when major changes are planned. 
Namespaces seemed to appear on the scene quite quickly.  I do see some
advantages for them though.  By contrast, I have been very relieved that
S4 classes have not posed a problem for my code that relies on "old"
classes (totally unlike my experience with S-Plus) but any time changes
are made that involve some incompatibilies with old code there should be
some pause.

In Hmisc and Design I reference several functions that were not exported
from packages that now use namespaces.  There is an elegant solution with
the package:::function notation, but I have been unable to use this
solution because I use one code base for all versions of R and S-Plus. 
This notation generates syntax errors in all but late versions of R.

Let me add to the wish list the creation of some mechanism to better track
improvements and bug fixes in packages, such as a change log link by each
package's area in CRAN, or easy access to CVS information from there. 
When I report bugs (e.g., in read.xport in foreign [due somewhat to
problems inherent with SAS's format] or ace or avas in acepack) it would
be nice to see some announcement when the bugs are resolved, or to easily
track this.  Even a checkbox that the package maintainer has seen the bug
report even if she/he currently does not have time to work on it would be
very helpful, as would a notation that the bug report was found to be
"buggy".

Subject: [Rd] xtable feature addition suggestion
Message-ID: <20040117233017.GA6866@gmx.de>

	Hi, attached follows a patch to add a feature that I think it would be useful having in the print.xtable function of the xtable package. It adds the option 'tabular.environment' to that function, which could be used to set an alternative tabular environment, as the name already suggests. 

	This is particulary useful when dealing with long tables, which do not fit in a single page. In the default behaviour, using \begin{tabular} ... \end{tabular}, everything that doesn't fit on the page dissappears. By using the LaTeX package 'longtable' and the 'tabular.environment="longtable"' option to print.xtable() this and other problems can be overcome, adding more flexiblity to the package.

	Thank you,

	I highly agree with you on this. It would be very nice having a fully
featured bug reporting system, where you could upload patches, discuss
improvements on existing packages or on the R-core itself, request for
features and so on. I think that Bugzilla (www.bugzilla.org) would suit
these expectations very well. It is the bug tracking system used by huge
projects like Mozilla (bugzilla.mozilla.org), Gentoo (bugs.gentoo.org),
and  Redhat (bugzilla.redhat.com), and based on my own experience I'd say
it addresses most of the things you pointed out.

	It works (at least in Gentoo, which is the one I'm more used to
working with) like this: someone files in a bug report. In the bug report
itself one informs the type of the bug report (a bug, a feature improvement, a
request to the developer), the severity, and any other relevant information. It
is also possible to upload attachments (like proposed patches) or additional
information on the report.

	The bug report then is assigned to a given group or, in the case of
packages to the person who is in charge for mantaining it. Anyone then can read
the bug report and make suggestions or propose fixes (see for example:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30784 ). [As opposed to the current
system, where the bug report can't even be linked to a website, and all the
discussion should be done via the mailing lists]. The maintainer or any
other other authorized developer can then accept or reject the proposed
suggestions, close the bug as duplicate, as invalid or at least inform that
he is aware of the problem and will work on it some time later.

	Just my two cents,

It might have (and I wouldn't mind replacing Jitterbug with something
that is actually maintained itself!), but there's another rear-end problem... 

Who's going to do the actual work? 

This means both fixing bugs and keeping the bug repository current.
This is not easy, even for base R. We have the Jitterbug r-bugs site,
which at least helps us not to forget bugs that have been reported,
but we often forget to close bugs as they are fixed and it often takes
a while before someone gets around to sorting the incoming directory.
This work is not going away with a more advanced system, and getting
the - hmmm - "varied" group of package maintainers to participate
sounds like a can of worms to me.

A lot of wishlist suggestions need at least cooperation from R-core, who
may not agree that a change is desirable even if someone else were to
write the code. A  bug-tracking system for contributed packages is one of
the exceptions. There's nothing to stop some package developer(s) created
a bug tracking system and making accounts available to other people
(except the time, resources, security issues, etc).

Keeping track of changes is harder. The CVS commit logs for foreign and
survival are with the log for R itself on http://developer.r-project.org.
It's not even that hard to write R code to read the page and extract
entries relevant to that package.

For CRAN to list changes to other packages would require cooperation from
all the package developers. If the maintainer of acepack isn't
sufficiently together to reply to your messages, he probably won't be
keeping up with other aspects of change tracking.  Even trying to extract
a NEWS or Changelog file might not work -- eg for survival the Changelog
file is Terry Therneau's change log, not my log for changes to the R port.

That's my point.  Maintainance is critical, and any time spent on
systems administration (systems in the generic sense, here it's
bug-tracking) is less time spent on other more useful, or interesting,
or high-payoff items.

I'm probably not the only one who wished Peter had more time for other
things...

        I agree that it would  probably take some time to set up the new system,
and maintaince at the beggining would take time too. On the other hand I believe
that the  producitivy gain fostered by the new system on the long term  could perhaps
counterbalance the initial effort. The main effort would be setting up the new
system and handdling accounts to the package mantainers, after that, most of it
would be left to the users of the system. I don't have much experience with
administrating the Bugzilla system yet but I'm installing in my box and will post
my experiences to the list.

Excellent!  It would be great to have a place to track bugs for
packages.  Best of luck!

Changes always show up in r-devel (the main CVS branch, not the
mailing list) first.  Package developers should be keeping a
relatively up to date copy of it around if they're doing things that
are likely to break.

I'd recommend avoiding that as much as you can.  If things aren't
exported from a package, then the package writer is likely to feel
free to change them without warning.  It's much better to convince the
package writer that they missed something in their export list.

>but I have been unable to use this

I think it's reasonable to restrict the availability of updates to
your packages to the currently released R version.  There are reasons
why people might not be up to date (e.g. only doing upgrades at a
specific time of year), but they'll still have access via CRAN to
older versions of your package.

Compatibility with S-PLUS is a lot harder, of course.

I need to do that more often.  But sometimes it's hard to know what things
I do that are likely to break.  That's where there needs to be some other
mechanism for user communications.

That's a good solution in general, but I could see legitimate
disagreements about what should be exported, so this will not always solve
the problem.

Yes that's the real problem.

Absolutely, I'm just getting at the need for better ways to provide input
to R-core for their consideration, perhaps.  And I wish that a unified
mechanism would exist for all package developers to use, with some
incentives (or bug-tracking requirements for a package to be kept in
CRAN).

Well, there is a NEWS file that is worth consulting, and we (Kurt in 
particular) run all the CRAN packages after every major change and daily.
See  http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/checkSummary.html.  We do also 
tend to tell package authors directly if their packages break, at least if 
they were previously warning-free.

It seems the sort of thing you do is to call methods directly where you 
could equally well call the generic, since that is what is currently 
failing in Design and Hmisc (if survfit.km is a survfit method).

That's not showing up in failures on the tests under R-patched.  Of the
listed dependencies only grid, lattice and survival have namespaces, and
only survival has been added since 1.8.1.  (I suspect the R-patched tests 
are against the 1.8.1 versions of the recommended packages, not the 
current versions.)

I think it does.  If the package writer wants a function to be private,
would-be users should respect that decision.  Most of the cases we have
encountered have been calling methods directly rather than coercing
objects to the right class and calling the generic.  In extremis, copy
(with permission) the function you want from the package sources and
rename it.

Unless I made a mistake there are no current uses of ::: in CRAN packages, 
and there are very few in base R (and quite a lot of the methods::: should 
probably better be methods::).

Generally when people know something is likely to cause trouble,
there's a posting to this mailing list  ---  but it's easy to overlook
it among all the other traffic.

To make it a bit easier for Windows package developers to test against
r-devel, I'm going to keep a reasonably up-to-date Windows build
online.  For now it's on CRAN, but there are concerns about the impact
on the mirrors of the extra file size and download traffic.  However,
if I have to move it the links on CRAN will be updated, so it's safe
to say you should start looking at
<http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base>.

Are you sure about that? I can't find old contributed packages, but it

I will start checking NEWS.  The kind of news I need though is more about
bugs that do not cause the package to break.

The point of calling methods directly is efficiency, otherwise I would not
use this dirty practice.  When bootstrapping or otherwise calling methods
repeatedly, I seek the lowest level functions for speed.  This conflicts
with the namespace idea.  I think this should have been taken into
consideration when designing namespaces.

That is a possibility.  None of the approaches we've named are without
maintenance problems.

Not sure about source versions.  Windows binaries are available from
1.6 on, in <http://www.cran.mirrors.pair.com/bin/windows/contrib>.   

We have talked about when to drop 1.6; I'd like to keep it online for
a year after the next version comes out (which would mean 1.6 goes
away this spring, 1.7 in the fall, etc.).  This means that someone has
at least a year to upgrade their R installation.

Submission from: (NULL) (195.221.43.136)


qchisq(1,10) works well but qchisq(1,10,ncp=0) does not work whereas ncp=0 is
the default value of the function qchisq(1,10). (of course, 10 will be replaced
by any integer value).
Let us notice that this bug occurs only when applying probability one.
(qchisq(seq(0,.9,.1),10,ncp=0) works very well).

Technically survfit.km() isn't a survival method, since it's called
directly by survfit() rather than by UseMethod, but it works like one.
It's an internal function that has never been documented, which is why it
wasn't exported.

If people want it, I can export it.  I hadn't heard from anyone wanting it
exported.

Are you sure there is a measurable difference in calling methods directly?
The dispatch overhead on formula (one of your uses) appears to be about
10 microseconds.  (Note, negligible even for 10,000 bootstraps.)

I believe we took the real performance penalties into account (and 
namespaces had performance pluses as well as minuses).

What is the problem with coercing to the right class and calling the 
generic.

Merci, Remy, for the report.

Note that I've been working on improvements to "pnchisq" (C) and "qnchisq"
for R-devel for several days now.

You will see fixes there pretty soon, I hope.

Brian,

I don't worry about dispatch overhead.  I do worry about overhead of

Thomas - I would appreciate getting survfit.km and survreg.fit exported.

What you call "attachments" is the MIME way --- which I very
much prefer -- but the default is the other way (which you seem
to prefer).

Here is what you said:

and your code is failing in R-devel because you are calling
formula.default. So, *why* are you calling formula.default?

Calling e.g. glm.fit not glm is not to do with methods, and apparently
survfit.km is not a method.

That was fixed 16Dec03 for the next version to be submitted to CRAN.  I no
longer call formula.default.

You're right, it just has to do with survfit.km needing to be exported.

Debian uses a convention that (somewhat simplified)

if the package is a standard upstream package then
   its changelog or news or changes or ... file is installaed as ChangeLog
   and the Debian maintainer changes go into ChangeLog.Debian
else if the package is a 'native' Debian package
   the changelog is installed as ChangeLog
fi

R CMD check could warn if there is not ChangeLog or Changes file, and
thereby suggest that authors provide them.

R CMD install could install them in a standard place as we control the
installation mechanism.

Would that help?  In order to parse a Changelog, we'd need a common format.
We could start with the standard emacs mode (with vi or, mercy on them,
notepad users can emulate free-hand).  Or is all this too restrictive?

The good thing is that enough rigour was put into CRAN practices early so
ensure a very decent level of conformity across packages. We could try to
extend this.

Hth, Dirk

Being somewhat overwhelmed at the moment, I read this quickly as 
"maintains itself,"  and thought that would be pretty neat.

Back on earth, and speaking with no inside knowledge, I have the 
impression someone has to spend a lot of time removing R bug reports 
that really never should have been admitted into the repository.

Since this is a wish list, it would be nice if there were a system to 
allow reports to sit in a temporary "unconfirmed bug reports" area where 
all users could add comments like "confirmed in R-patched on zzz," 
"works in Linux," "fixed in R-devel," "here is a work around," "here is 
a patch," "this is a FAQ," or "read the documentation." Then some 
volunteer or the package maintainer would occasionally need to sort 
these, but a lot more of the work would be done by the larger R community.

Not true here.  Probably an issue with your system.

I would suspect so. However I've had no issues with any other software,
and I can access R by starting it through the DCOM server.

Is there any form of logging built into the binary release?

There's a known bug in the MinGW startup code that causes a debug trap
during startup.  Normally this doesn't make any difference (the system
ignores it), but it's really irritating when running R under a
debugger.  

This is probably not the cause of your main problem, unless some other
application puts the OS into some sort of debug mode.

The current r-devel works around this bug.  (You can download
yesterday's build from CRAN.)  I'd be interested in hearing if you see
your original crash using this version, or whether it has been fixed
too.

"Of course" "R CMD check" would have the harder job of also have
to work properly on non-Debian, non-Linux, even non-Unix systems..
For Windows, there's already the filename capitalization mess.

I would be very much in favor of this.  But then I'm biased:
Using Emacs 100% and using ChangeLog's for most of my packages
 {for those who don't know: "C-x 4 a" = add-change-log-entry-other-window
  this works even from an PKG/R/foo.R file, adding to toplevel
  PKG/ChangeLog, automatically inserting the R/foo.R filename
  (and a function name) there.
 }
Having a common format for parsing would allow for quite a few
things, one of the first being a translation to HTML.

Indeed!
Honestly,  I did have the same idea after Frank's post  --- not
knowing the Debian setup --- but didn't post *because* of my
biases (above).

I've got a package I would like to send out for testing and have noticed a

the code for inserting vertical lines, in the tabular environment, causes

but C:\>rcmd build --binary nlsystemfit doesn't choke, but doesn't produce
all the documents either. When I run rcmd rd2dvi.sh <package> I get the

I'll remove the | from the formatting for now...

R-developers:

How do we go about adding keywords to the KEYWORDS and KEYWORDS.db files?

I would like to add  "econometrics  & Econometrics" to the Statistics
section of the file... Is this something I would have to do through CVS?

Statistics

 datagen  & Functions for generating data sets
 distribution & Probability Distributions and Random Numbers
 univar  & simple univariate statistics  [!= S]
 htest  & Statistical Inference
 models  & Statistical Models


Thanks for handling my ignorance,
Jeff.

You appear to be writing latex, but I guess this is part of an Rd file.
Do read `Writing R Extensions' for the description of the actual 
Rd language (which does not have that format specifier}.

\hline is not part of the Rd language either, and you will need the 
two-argument form of \eqn{} for expressions like those.

Finally, it is not `build' that chokes, but `INSTALL' called by `build 
--binary'.  It is often much easier to see what is going on by calling 
INSTALL directly.

You don't, unless you mean for your own private copy of R (which I guess 
you don't as you mention CVS).  Only R-core can alter the distributed R 
sources.

You can request R-core to make an addition, but that needs a reasoned
argument (including why all of the existing categories are inappropriate).

Note that `keywords' is a misnomer -- these are really categories.
You can use \concept to add keywords (in that manual your previous posting 
showed unfamiliarity with, Writing R Extensions).

Remember, that Rd is not LaTeX __at all_  It is format
translated to text/html/latex (and "R" for the examples).
We know that the format is severely limited and had expected to
replace it by a much more versatile XML based format  
but then realized that people would have to *write* in such a
format, most probably needing a smart editor-interface .... a
whole can of worms we didn't dare to open really.

The "Writing R Extensions" clearly says

If it's true that R CMD check does not give any warnings on your

   \tabular{|l|c|c|c|}{
    \hline
    ....

then, that's a bug(let) in R CMD check (patches welcome :-)
Note that \hline is not valid as well.

As a matter of fact, the bug you mention isn't new.
That's been PR#6421  which has been fixed several weeks ago in
both "R-patched" and "R-devel". 
(The other things I said above are true in any case.)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0401201408060.12918-100000@reclus.nhh.no>

I contacted John Fox about this first, because parts of the file are 
attributed to him. He says that he didn't write rstandard.glm(), and 
suggests asking r-devel.

As it stands, rstandard.glm() has summary(model)$dispersion outside the
sqrt(), while in rstandard.lm(), the sd is already sqrt()ed. This seems to
follow stdres()  in VR/MASS/R/stdres.R.

Of course for the c("poisson", "binomial")  families,
summary(model)$dispersion is 1, so sqrt doesn't make a difference, but
working with an epidemiologist, Marilia Carvalho, we wanted to map the
standardised residuals of a quasipoisson null model of cases offset by
log(pop.at.risk), and rstandard.glm() seemed to compress the values more
than we'd have expected. Her colleague: "Valeska (L.  Andreozzi) says that
she has already noticed that, and as McCullagh & Nelder (2nd ed, pg 397)
says, the dispersion is inside the sqrt". (That's the way I read 12.5 on 
p. 397 too). I can't see that summary(model)$dispersion has already been 
subject to sqrt() in sum(object$weights * object$residuals^2)/df.r in 
summary.glm().

Should:

    res / (summary(model)$dispersion * sqrt(1 - infl$hat))

be:

    res / (sqrt(summary(model)$dispersion * (1 - infl$hat)))

on line 117 in base/R/lm.influence.R?

Best wishes,

Roger

Yes, to all what you said.
Only "base/" is "stats/" in R-devel where I've just committed
the fix.
It's been kind of a typo I had introduced when making rstandard
generic.

Just as long as the filenames are case-insensitively unique, we're
okay.  So no changelog coexisting with ChangeLog.

As long as we give clear documentation about what the format should
be, and it's not too obscure, I don't see a problem for Windows users
here.  Non-Windows users (and the INSTALL script) should be prepared
to handle CR-LF line terminations, because not all editors make it
easy to avoid those; there's also the possibility of the last line not
being terminated.  But those are easy problems with standard
solutions.

It should be easy enough for someone to write a changelog function in
R, I'd assume, which might solve this?  

(of course, I'm not volunteering until 2009).

Folks,

Have you looked at R's own ChangeLog recently?

You can insist on a ChangeLog, but some of us may be tempted to follow 
R's own example ....

Message-ID: <20040120173037.6745810538@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

And where is the bug?

Typing the name of an R object at the console prints the value of the 
object.  That seems to be what you have, the beginnings of the value of 
the function `help'.

Have you read the FAQ about what constitutes a bug?  This is the 
documented behaviour.

Right. I'd conjecture that it is effectively the same on Unix, i.e. I can't
see any sane project using both changelog and ChangeLog.

And let's not forget that Emacs and XEmacs are available on Windows (in
various 'standard' or 'cygwin' flavours)

I've been using a cvs2cl.pl (http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl), a nice little
perl script to auto-generate GNU-style 
changelogs from CVS log information.

This site also has a proposed XML format for changelogs, and cvs2cl can
optionally produce this instead.  Finally, they have an XSLT sylesheet that
will convert the XML changlong format into an HTML/XHTML page.

How about we borrow this tool and perhaps XML format for R?

That makes the assumption that there is worthwhile log messages in
CVS.  

In 2 related projects, we are looking at 75% (with ESS) and much less,
maybe 20-25% (BioConductor) of useful and informative log mesages in
CVS.

I'm not precisely sure how well R compares -- a quick check of various
files, based on anoncvs access, suggests that it's pretty good,
assuming that you have cvs access (anonymous or otherwise) to
translate the sometimes terse descriptions.  Compare with
bioconductor, where some of the check-in comments are completely
useless without corresponding diff's (which of course, are completely
self explanatory :-).

best,
-tony

Yes, for an arbitrary project, the CVS log files may not be good enough or
may be too verbose.  The generated logs may still need some hand editing to
be given to clients.

OTOH, now that I know that I'm going to use cvs2cl, the quality and style of
my CVS log entries has gotten better.

Finally, it shouldn't be too hard to parse the XML and provide links to the
appropriate CVS web view...

How about we just add these to a package available on CRAN?  How about we
just make a package of the Burns Statistics functions?  There are already

In gregmisc I have a function textplot which does much of what you want, and
I've just added (in CRAN incoming now) a new function sinkplot() which
accomplishes exactly what you've asked for.  Here is the example:

   set.seed(12456)
   x <- factor(sample( LETTERS[1:5], 50, replace=T))
   y <- rnorm(50, mean=as.numeric(x), sd=1)

   par(mfrow=c(1,2))
   boxplot(y~x, col="darkgreen")

   sinkplot()
   anova(lm(y~x))
   sinkplot("plot",col="darkgreen")

The only thing that isn't quite right is the default R font is
proportionally spaced so the matrix columns don't line up right.  I'll need
change the default font.   [Are any of the Hershey fonts fixed width?]

That one got fixed a while back for r-devel, by using na.last="keep"
in the apply call, which is effectively the same fix. Looks like it
was never filed in r-bugs.

As I've mentioned a number of times.  I find it very useful to have lowess()
become a generic function so that a lowess.formula() can be defined.

Below is a patch that makes both changes, as well as updating the
corresponding help documentation.

I don't really see the point.  lowess() is a two-dimensional smoother only
so the main point would only be to allow lowess(y ~ x, dat) instead of
lowess(dat$x, dat$y).

`R-devel' is said to be Under development (unstable), so please don't 
report problems to R-help.  (There is an R-devel list to which I have 
diverted this).

The problem is a problem in trying to cope with TMPDIR with spaces in,
now fixed, I hope (since it depended on the exact toolset in use).

Notice that is *not* the same error message, and it is not relevant.

The clue is the set of quotes around the directory name.  Had you copied 
an actual example such as

Error: cannot change to directory `'c:/TEMP/Rbuild.3796''

I would have got there a lot sooner.  As the FAQ asks, please report what 
actually happened, not hypotheses.

It is INSTALL not install!

what do you mean?  I think I haven't understood....

We've followed the rule to use
 NEWS +  "informative (but sometimes terse)" CVS messages.

Using a *manual* ChangeLog is a different approach and doing both
(or even all three) doesn't make sense at all.  That's why Greg
mentioned the "cvs2cl" tools where ChangeLog is autogenerated
from the CVS logs.

However, for (non-core) R *packages* things are very different:  
    The majority of package authors will never use CVS (and if
    they were urged to, they'd use almost empty log messages),
but encouraging them to use a ChangeLog file in a simple format
seems feasible IMO.

Encourage or force?

Quite a few packages do already have a ChangeLog, and I took the thrust of 
this thread to be to require one or at least nag for one.  It started as

Dirk> R CMD check could warn if there is not ChangeLog or Changes file, and
Dirk> thereby suggest that authors provide them.

My point is that we cannot know if there is useful information in the 
ChangeLog, and all too frequently (from wider experience than R) it is 
either

manual and incomplete (and missing the change I am searching for)
automatic and far too detailed for useful searching (and with records of 
   all the less-than accurate CVS messages).

I think most times you mentioned this, Brian told you that 
"loess" was there and was generic and was to be recommended over
lowess anyway.

Hence I think we should hear reasons why lowess is to be
preferred to loess in some cases.
[and I think I may well support your argument; I've forgotten
 which reasons I thought to have in the past when deciding for
 lowess (against loess).]

*Not* making lowess generic is one way to recommend loess ;-)

Not quite: loess() is not generic, but it does have a formula interface
and it was recommended over lowess() by the authors of both.  (loess()
is not generic for the reasons I sketch below.)

It seems to me only to be worth making functions generic if they are
likely to be extended in unforeseen ways: making image() generic was one
of those.  For lowess, the only plausible methods are for formula and
vector, so why not just write a wrapper called lowessForm?   I took the 
same approach when re-implementing loess: it could have had a matrix + 
vector interface but it did not seem worth setting up a generic just for 
that.

This sounds suspiciously like an editorial "we".

I do have plans of a package of Burns Statistics functions, but haven't
got around to it yet.  However, I do agree with Kevin that "head" and
"tail" are good candidates for base (though I'm not sure it would be
number 1 on my wishlist).  "head" and especially "tail" have value in
programming as well as interactive use, which I think is a stronger
argument for inclusion in base than just being handy interactively.

Note that `R base' could mean the base package or the R distribution, and 
I don't know which is meant.  Could one of you please clarify?

The base package in R-devel is much reduced, but these could be a 
candidates for the `utils' (or perhaps `tools') packages.

Not to mention that "lowess" is a speling misteak!

Utils, I'd say. That one that is loaded by default in an interactive
session, so that would be the place for "handy functions" like this.
If you have to say library(tools) first, they won't be handy enough.

On further investigation, the problem goes away if you change the usages 
of system() in build to R_system().  The latter was introduced to avoid 
exactly the sort of shell-dependent quoting hell that has happened here.

I think it should be required, and as with Rd files, we'll check the
form but not the content.  For example, require an entry in a
specified format for the current version number, and have optional
entries for earlier version numbers.

I have no idea what the Debian ChangeLog format looks like (other than
the R example!), but I'd say if we do this, it would make sense to use
the same format as NEWS (and the Windows CHANGES file), or put those
two files into the new format.  They are currently easy to edit
manually and easy to print and read.  I don't think the same could be
said of an XML format, but I could be wrong.

Thomas mentioned a
----------------------
Changelog: <filename>
----------------------
entry in DESCRIPTION.  Using either 'NEWS' or (any
capitalization of) 'ChangeLog' for <filename> would allow for
both formats (see also below).

For some packages (where I don't use CVS), I'd definitely want
to stick with ChangeLog: It's more precise, and using Emacs
(other editors / IDE ?), creating entries is *very* convenient
and efficient (as said before: datetime, author, file name,
function name are all created automatically).  

Any volunteers for writing a "ChangeLog -> NEWS"
converter (in Perl most probably, since that's what we assume
for building anyway)?  If we had this in place, we could allow both
formats in the package sources, but install only the NEWS type
(and/or it's translations ...).

Debian used for Data Mining in Business. Rodney Gedda [21]reported in
Computerworld about the use of Debian by [22]Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia. Principal
computer scientist for enterprise data mining, Dr. Graham Williams,
stated that CSIRO uses a number of toolkits including R, GNOME, and
Python scripting, running on the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.
"The Department of Health and Ageing has a 200 CPU cluster running
Debian GNU/Linux", Williams said. "Debian is a stable server operating
system that is easy to maintain and we also use it on desktops."

Some of us don't mind using XML because it gives us much more
flexibility to do interesting things with our data quite easily at the
expense of a little markup.  If we are going to insist on a particular
form, please let's not make it the lowest common denominator so that
it penalizes people who use richer formats.  This only increases the
need for separate repositories like Omegahat where the nature of many
of the packages is outside the scope of the R CMD check tools (by
necessity) and so cannot be put on CRAN.

If we have to insist on checking a particular format, but allowing for
the possibility of multiple versions, we have one format that we know
is rich enough for everybody and from which we can generate human
readable versions during a build.  And that is an R object!  Having a
tool that takes a Debian or any other format and converting it to an R
object would still allow others who use XML or any other format to do
the same.  But if we have to write XSL or R functions to process XML
to Debian Changelog, it is just one more hurdle that prohibits other
work from being done.

So why not use R as a useful programming language for manipulating
these data in such a way that others can extend the S4 classes
representing the changelog information and we can immediately have a
foundation that supports growth and experimentation.  We have already
seen issues about writing Perl scripts and trying to manage them in
the future to admit additions.

Well, I have been using CVS for a couple of years, but I haven't 
mastered the art of knowing when is the best point to commit and how to 
make the log messages really useful. I would be interested if anyone 
knows a good reference or would write an essay on this.

Attempting to substitute a NA causes an error in sub.

> sub(x=NA,pattern="x",replacement="y")
Error in sub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case, extended) : 
	invalid argument
> sub(x=NA,pattern=NA,replacement="y")
[1] NA

The help page for sub says only
   For 'regexpr' it is an error for 'pattern' to be 'NA', otherwise
     'NA' is permitted and matches only itself.
so that this behaviour is undocumented. 

I believe that sub(x=NA,pattern,replacement) should always be NA.

Sorry to be difficult, but in devel: stat/R/nafns.R line 32
na.omit.default is now class "exclude" and na.exclude.default line 86 is
still class "omit"! I know I need new glasses, don't I?

Would it be easy to write a function that read the XML and produced
something like the current NEWS format?

If that's easy, then one option is to suggest that people keep the
original source in XML, with the BUILD process doing the conversion,
but allow people to edit the human-readable version directly if they
prefer.

Yes, and it should fail or return NA, as the required information is not
available. The problem is that it had logical NAs not numeric NAs for the
center component.

#3682 points out something that is on the help page: if you supply covmat 
as a matrix (and not a covariance list) there is no information on the 
centring done and x is ignored.

Certainly easier than the other way around. As an added bonus if the 
XML happened to be, say, RSS the R XML ChangeLog could be kept on 
r-project.org and subscribed using these RSS newsreaders that have 
become so popular of late. It also solves my biggest problem with NEWS 
where rsync tells me the NEWS file has changed, but I can't locate the 
change for the life of me.

Thank you for the report.

Yes, a slight inconsistency, but not a bug, really.

but the point is that NA's are not equal:
A simple 'NA' is logical, so one could argue 
t should give an error in any case.

First note the following:

> str(sub(x=NA,pattern=NA, replacement="y"))
 chr NA
> str(cNA <- as.character(NA))
 chr NA
> str(sub(x=cNA,pattern=cNA, replacement="y"))
 chr NA
> str(sub(x=cNA,pattern="x", replacement="y"))
 chr NA

So sub() works fine for character NA's .

    JonS> I believe that sub(x=NA,pattern,replacement)

We could extend sub() / gsub() to coerce its `x' to character,
then this would work, 
or we should make it give an error because NA is logical, not a
character.

The first option would be inline with already allowing logical
NA for `pattern' in sub/gsub.

Opinions?

I think it would make sense for the regex functions to coerce all these
arguments to character.  I don't see where it could cause any harm

Duncan TL's suggestion to use Using R for the mark-up structure seems
very reasonable to me.  Asking package authors to write in XML
directly, or anything that would make doing that the path of least
resistance, is I think a non-starter.

  I agree completely. We need to be careful about making package
  writing more difficult than it already is (and for some it is 
  very difficult).

Actually it is showing the largest value as either 32.9 or 33.9.
Notice that the stem is being incremented by 2, in which case the
leaf can be ambiguous.

An R structure wouldn't be bad either---you can output whatever format  
you want and less reliance on other languages can't hurt. For that  
matter I wouldn't be averse to seeing DESCRIPTION going that way (not  
that its all that difficult to parse I suppose). In any case, while I'm  
thinking about it, ?DESCRIPTION would be handy.

Subject: [Rd] Enhancement to termplot()
Message-ID: <574B2D4C-4E14-11D8-A1E7-000A95CDA0F2@anu.edu.au>

I'd like to make the following change to termplot():

Add panel=points as an extra parameter.

Replace
        if (partial.resid)
             points(xx, pres[, i], cex = cex, pch = pch, col = col.res, 
...)
by
        if (partial.resid)
             panel(xx, pres[, i], cex = cex, pch = pch, col = col.res, 
...)

Also, I think, add col.smooth, span and iter as named parameters; see 
below.

This allows, e.g., the following

par(mfcol=c(2, 2))
data(mtcars)
cars.lm <- lm(mpg~disp+hp, data=mtcars)
termplot(cars.lm, partial.resid=T, panel=panel.smooth, 
col.smooth="blue")
termplot(cars.lm, partial.resid=T, panel=panel.smooth, col.terms=0,
                 col.smooth="blue")

(col.terms=0 hides the fitted response line or curve.)
These partial regression plots can be highly insightful in a regression
context.

Inclusion of col.smooth, span and iter as named parameters is not
strictly necessary, but it does avert complaints from plot() when they
are passed as unnamed parameters.

(I foreshadowed this when I submitted problem #6327, and offered a fix
that, in default of anything better, I assume will be made or has been 
made.)

I'm as good as any.  You can view the bug repository at
<http://bugs.r-project.org/>.  There's an entry there that says Thomas
Lumley has fixed things.   I tried a couple of variations on your bug
example and they seemed to work fine.

I think that was added; there's this NEWS file entry:

    o	termplot() has an option to smooth the partial residuals.

You can view the up-to-the minute source at

 http://franz.stat.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/R/

You need to look in src/library/stats (the new stats package) to find
the termplot source and documentation; it can be annotated to show
what was added on each date.

By default you're seeing the source to r-devel (the upcoming 1.9.0);
you can choose a different branch (e.g. the r 1.8 patches branch) to
see different variations.  I don't think the bug fix for termplot has
been added to the patch branch.  Since the packages were reorganized,
it's a lot harder to add things to both branches, so most things are
only going into r-devel (and new features are never supposed to go
into the patch version, only bug fixes).

I added a smooth= option, and fixed the bug at that time (a search of
bugs.r-project.org finds it in Models-fixed).  The suggested
fix didn't quite work, but a modification of it did.

BTW, for people who don't know, you can usually find help pages for
R-devel linked at the R web page, allowing you to check if things have
been changed.  At the moment it hasn't caught up with the reorganisation
of the base packages.

I like the head() and tail() functions -- nice additions.

One question:  is there a return type or class for head.function that
would print without the quotes?  E.g.

> head(plot.default)
[1] "function (x, y = NULL, type = \"p\", xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, "
[2] "    log = \"\", main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab =
NULL, "         
[3] "    ann = par(\"ann\"), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes,
panel.first = NULL, "
[4] "    panel.last = NULL, col = par(\"col\"), bg = NA, pch =
par(\"pch\"), "    
[5] "    cex = 1, lty = par(\"lty\"), lab = par(\"lab\"), lwd =
par(\"lwd\"), "   
[6] "    asp = NA, ...) "     

would look nicer as

> head(plot.default)
function (x, y = NULL, type = "p", xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, 
    log = "", main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, 
    ann = par("ann"), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes, panel.first =
NULL, 
    panel.last = NULL, col = par("col"), bg = NA, pch = par("pch"), 
    cex = 1, lty = par("lty"), lab = par("lab"), lwd = par("lwd"), 
    asp = NA, ...) 

(which are the first 6 lines you see if you print plot.default).

Either setup so that cat() will be used to print it (add class + print
method) or return noquote(....) The latter will give this effect:

> noquote("function (x, y = NULL, type = \"p\", xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, ")
[1] function (x, y = NULL, type = "p", xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL,

i.e. include line numbers.

I think this produces a nice display:

function (x, n = 6) {
    lines <- matrix(deparse(x),ncol=1)
    rownames(lines) <- 1:nrow(lines)
    colnames(lines) <- ''
    noquote(tail(lines,n=n))
}

36         box(...)                                                
37     if (ann)                                                    
38         title(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, 
39             ...)                                                
40     invisible()                                                 
41 }                        

Unfortunately, I doubt if people would really want the result to be a
matrix, so maybe a new class is what is needed.

I would just use as.matrix(deparse(x)).

I knew this happened, but I did not know what people wanted.  I can only 
see this being used interactively (it at all: I would use page), so that 
seems as good as any.

I like Duncan's idea.  I doubt I have ever used head on a function
for real, but tail of a function can be handy for seeing the structure
of the return value.  I agree that this is only likely to be used 
interactively.

Subject: [Rd] ltext( pos=NULL )
Message-ID: <20040127075442.GA2645@s1x.local>

ltext( 0, 0, pos=NULL, label="xxxx")
gives an error message.

The help page of ``ltext'' references to the help page of ``text''
where the default value of pos is set to NULL.

To solve the problem ``ltext'' could be changed:
OLD:
    if (!missing(pos))
NEW:
    if (!missing(pos) && ! is.null(pos) )

Okay, I'll put in those changes (with Brian's improvement).  One other
one I'll look at:

If a matrix doesn't have row names, I might add names like '[nn,]' to
it, so I get results like

> x <- matrix(1:100,ncol=2)
> tail(x)
      [,1] [,2]
[45,]   45   95
[46,]   46   96
[47,]   47   97
[48,]   48   98
[49,]   49   99
[50,]   50  100

instead of the current

> tail(x)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   45   95
[2,]   46   96
[3,]   47   97
[4,]   48   98
[5,]   49   99
[6,]   50  100

I just want to be careful that this doesn't mess up something else.

Dear Customer!

This is an automatic response from our support system, because you have sent a message to our support system e-mail address, which does not refer to an existing support case tracking number. We regret to inform you that we can no longer process such messages and your e-mail has, therefore, NOT been delivered.

We have recently implemented a new support case management system in order to expedite processing of support cases and to provide better, more efficient, and more timely support responses to our valued customers. If you are writing to our support team about a new incident, please follow the step-by-step instructions in our Online Support Center at http://www.altova.com/support to submit your information - this will ensure that our support team gets all the required information and will automatically assign a new support case tracking number to your request, so that we can better manage our communication with you and, therefore, provide better support services to you.

If you are responding to a previous e-mail you have received from one of our technical support engineers, please make sure that you use the "Reply" function in your mail software, so that the support case tracking number remains part of the subject line and our system can automatically assign your reply to the correct engineer.

If you are responding to a reply from one of our technical support engineers that was sent prior to the installation of the new support management system and does not yet have a tracking number, we regret that we have to ask you to please enter your response as a new support case using the Online Support Center at http://www.altova.com/support - this is only a temporary problem during the migration to the new support management system, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Sincerely,

ALTOVA Support

I think this could be being too "helpful".  Using tail on a matrix
may often be done in a program so I think leaving things as they
come is the best policy.

Yes, after a couple of minutes thought, I agree.  If people want nicer
row labels when doing tail on a matrix, they should put their own
rownames in place.

I've committed the changes to head.function and tail.function.

Thank you for your interest in graduate studies at Binghamton University. 

This is an automated response that answers some of our most frequently asked
questions. 
If your question is NOT answered here, we invite you to visit our website at
http://gradschool.binghamton.edu; 
or you may contact us at gradsch@binghamton.edu, which will prompt a
personalized response. 
If you have already filed a graduate application with Binghamton University,
please supply your Program ID # with all future correspondence.
(If you reply directly to this email you will receive a second copy of this
automated response.)

10. OTHER INFORMATION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. APPLICATION

If you wrote to request an application, you may either 
		*	apply on-line (the fastest, less expensive, and the
preferred method) , or
		*      download and print a complete application (in PDF
form)
		
To apply on line, visit our website at:
<http://gradschool.binghamton.edu>
(Under the "Prospective Students" select "Admissions")

If you prefer to submit a paper version of our application, you may print
the application at:

<http://gradschool.binghamton.edu/gradapp.pdf>
(The PDF file contains the complete application packet)

Please note that the fee for submitting an electronic application is $55.
The fee for submitting a paper application is $70.

The on-line application form takes only 15-20 minutes to complete. Once we
receive your completed application (paper or electronic) and all necessary
supplemental materials (including application fee, letters of
recommendation, personal statement, test scores, and transcripts), your
application will be forwarded to the appropriate academic program. We should
note that  processing time is faster for on line applications, thus speeding
up the delivery of your application to your prospective program. 

As soon as the program makes a decision, the Graduate School will notify
you; at that time you will also be provided with a special PROGRAM ID CODE
that will allow you to check the status of your application on line
throughout the application process. 

Please note:  The Graduate School is currently revising the application and
considering the costs-effectiveness of its use. Thus, we are not currently
able to mail paper applications to prospective applicants.

2. APPLICATION DEADLINES

Application deadlines vary by department; when completing the on-line
application, the department deadline is provided to you. The dates below are
to be used as a general guideline and may not be the actual deadline for
your program of interest.

FALL ADMISSION:
International applicants (with or without funding consideration):  January
1-15
US citizens or permanent resident applicants:
	* with consideration for departmental funding: January 15-February 1

SPRING ADMISSION:
International applicants:  October 1
US citizens or permanent resident applicants:  October 15

Please note that some programs do not offer admission for the spring, while
others have spring admission but without departmental funding. This
information is provided to applicants when they start the on-line
application. If you decide not to use the on-line application, please check
with the prospective program to determine their deadlines.


3. APPLICATION FEE

The fee for on-line applications is $55/program. The fee for paper
applications is $70/program. 

An application fee must be paid by ALL applicants. 

We welcome checks, payable to "Binghamton University Graduate Admissions",
or charge-card authorization for either VISA or MasterCard. Please DO NOT
send cash.  If you are paying by credit card, send us the fee payment form
or a letter, making sure to include:

        * Name of credit card holder
        * Type of credit card (VISA or MasterCard)
        * Credit card number
        * Expiration date

Also make sure that the fee payment form includes the name of the applicant,
along with birthdate and address.

As a public institution supported by the State of New York, we are required
to charge an application fee for every applicant; despite our understanding
of the financial hardship that the application fee causes for some
applicants, we cannot make exceptions. (However, former [U.S. citizens] EOP,
HEOP, or SEEK students may obtain a fee waiver form from their undergraduate
institution.) 

4. ADMISSION DECISIONS

Admissions decisions are made by individual academic departments. The
Graduate School will promptly notify all applicants of the decision by
letter and email. The Graduate School cannot provide applicants with the
decision by phone. The length of time that passes between submittal of the
application and the decision varies by department. We understand the urgency
applicants feel as they await admission decisions. The Graduate School
attempts to process applications and forward them to the appropriate
department promptly in order to decrease the waiting.

5. APPLICATION STATUS

If you use the on-line application, you will be provided (via email) with a
Program ID #. That code can be used to check the status of your application
at: 

<http://gradschool.binghamton.edu/check.asp>

This site can be used to confirm the completeness of your application or
find out if a decision has been made.


6. ADMISSION DEFERRAL

If you have been admitted but now find that you will be unable to attend in
the semester for which you originally applied, you may request a deferral of
your admission to a future semester. All applicants are entitled to one FREE
admission deferral. Requests for deferral must be received any time before
the last day of classes during the semester in which an applicant was
admitted. We are unable to process requests for deferrals received after the
last day of classes of the semester of admission; in such cases, it will be
necessary to reapply.

To defer your admission, simply send an email message to
gradsch@binghamton.edu (indicate "ADMISSION DEFERRAL" in the SUBJECT LINE). 
Please provide us with
	* your full name,
	* your Program ID #
	* program applied, and
	* semester in which you plan to start your graduate studies. 

Your deferred admission status will be confirmed by both email and etter.

While there is no charge for this service the first time a deferral is
requested, second and subsequent deferral requests require payment of the
application fee.

7. FUNDING INFORMATION

Binghamton University offers a number of assistantships and fellowships to
all admitted graduate students, including international applicants. Over
1,000 full-time, degree-seeking graduate students at Binghamton University
receive some kind of funding each year. Graduate and teaching assistants are
provided by the various academic programs, research assistantships are
available through university grants, and adjunct lecture positions are
available for advanced graduate students. Fellowships or other miscellaneous
positions provide additional funding. 

The academic year stipends for Teaching and Graduate Assistants begin at
$8,100/year (higher in the sciences).  Research positions generally meet or
exceed this annual stipend. Graduate/teaching/and research assistants are
expected to work between 15 and 20 hours per week to earn the stipend.
Normally assistantship positions are accompanied by a full tuition
scholarship, valued at between $6,900 and $10,500 (depending on residency). 

These awards are assigned on a competitive basis. To apply for a graduate
assistantship, simply check the appropriate block on the application form.
Decisions regarding departmental funding are made by the individual graduate
program departments. Once a decision is made, admitted students are notified
by letter from the granting department.

In addition, student loans are available for full support or to supplement
TA/GA/RA appointments. Domestic students can obtain information on federal
loans from the Office of Financial Aid (http://bingfa.binghamton.edu).
International students may be eligible for alternative loans; Binghamton
partners with CitiBank to provide these funding options. International
students can obtain more information at www.studentloan.com.

8. GRE, GMAT, and TOEFL Scores

You will need to submit test scores for either GRE (all programs except
Music, Master of Public Administration, Master of Arts in Social Science) or
GMAT (School of Management). In order to expedite the process, we will
welcome your application packet even without the GRE or GMAT scores,
provided you make them available to us as soon as you can. It is important
that you are aware that we cannot authorize your admission to Binghamton
University until we receive your official GRE or GMAT scores.

If you are an international student, you must also submit TOEFL scores.
Exceptions are: 
	a) noncitizens from English-speaking countries, or
	b) applicants who have a college degree from an English-speaking
country.

Please specify CODE 2535 to have your scores sent to Binghamton University.

For additional information about these tests, you can visit the following
websites:

GRE:    http://www.gre.org
GMAT: 	http://www.gmac.com
TOEFL:  http://www.toefl.org

9. CONTACTING DEPARTMENTS

Some very specific questions will be better answered by the particular
academic department to which you intend to apply. Graduate program staff
will be able to provide you with information regarding current research
projects, faculty, and particular departmental policies. 

To obtain an e-mail directory, please send us a blank e-mail message to
gradsch@binghamton.edu with the phrase E-MAIL DIRECTORY on the subject line.
Shortly thereafter you will receive an automatic reply with the e-mail
addresses of academic departments, plus instructions on how to contact staff
and faculty at Binghamton University.

Note: Our website provides a useful search engine that you can use to find
the e-mail addresses of faculty, staff, and students in both undergraduate
and graduate programs at Binghamton University. To use it, point your

The @ character in path names causes the R build process to barf.

It is used on the AFS file system for OS-specific magic:

/afs/../../../../@sys/../.. links to a different directory on each system
type (the magic "@sys" is expanded by AFS at file access time to the
system value, such as alpha_dux40, hp_ux102, i386_linux24, etc).

It would be nice to have a 'help menu' item that pointed at the R-Project home

display local files).  This wish comes from a Windows RGui newbie user who
frequently needs to use the plentiful resources on the "mothership" to figure

Thanks for considering it.

The isoreg() function causes R to crash when called repeatedly. Consider the
following simple script:

{
library(modreg)
N <- 10
x <- rnorm(N)
print("Original x values:")
print(x)
for(n in (1:N)){print(y <- isoreg(x[1:n])$yf)}
}        

I am able to run (call) it several times, let say 6 or 10 times, and when trying
once more, R crashes. In Windows a screen with "The R GUI software has caused
errors and will be terminated by windows. All unsaved information will be lost."
message appears, using Linux R crashes with a mesage "Segmentation fault".

This has been fixed in my local version for some time, and will probably make 
it to r-devel in a few days. I don't think it warrants an update of the 
released version, but feel free to let me know if you think otherwise.

In .Rd files, we use \url{stuff} to refer to a URL on the web.  Just as the
documentation says.

Perhaps this isn't a bug, then, but certainly it's a trap for the unwary.  If
the construction
   \link{url{something}}
appears in a .Rd file, then 
   Rdconv --type=html ...
gets stuck and appears to grow and grow and grow...

My version of Perl is 5.6.0.

A warning in the documentation might be considered a fix for this, although it
might reasonably be regarded as going too far in warning people against their
own stupidity!  

Would it be better if it caused an error?  I have no idea what would be involved
in trapping that, and obviously if it's not a simple matter then this is one for
the trashcan.

I get the crash reproducibly in r-devel after I put "set.seed(2)"
ahead of the sample code above.  (Of course, r-devel doesn't need the
library(modreg), but that doesn't affect the bug.)  Other seeds and
the code works without error.

I tried tracing into R_isoreg to try to spot the problem, but the
error occurs after it returns.  It has all the symptoms of some code
writing outside allocated bounds, but I couldn't see where that
happened.

Dear sir,
Thank you for a swift reply.

Yes, but I don't think that seed 2 is the only one producing the crash,
since it occured quite randomly in my testing. For this seed=2 the problem
appeared for isoreg(x[1:3]) and nowhere else, I have tried it just now.
But, after restarting R, I
was able to run isoreg(x[1:4]) through isoreg(x[1:10]), then
isoreg(x[1:3]) and only after calling isoreg(x[1:3]) again R crashed - so
even when I knew there was a problem in isoreg(x[1:3]), it worked (once).

Please let me know if I could do anything else/more to help in tracking
the problem.

Best regards,
Petr Klasterecky

iKnots was allocated one element too short.  This only overruns if the 
sequence is monotone, as happens here for set.seed(2), N=3.  Fixed in 
R-devel.

The line 39 in isoreg.c needs to be

    SET_VECTOR_ELT(ans, 3, iKnots= allocVector(INTSXP, n));


Duncan was trying to give a reproducible example, Petr, as we do ask you 
to do in the FAQ.

It is easy to trap, so I have done so.

You were just slightly impatient: it would have given an error eventually!

There's a problem that the allowed complexity has to be very high for 
certain operations (mark_brackets for one) since you can write very 
complex files.  The same code is used for \url{}, which cannot be complex.
If we ever rewrite Rdconv ....

**** Help for Majordomo@esrf.fr:


This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
management system at Majordomo@esrf.fr.

This is version 1.94.4 of Majordomo.

If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced user's summary of
Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this message.

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe
and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list
archives.

You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands
in the body of mail messages addressed to "Majordomo@esrf.fr".
Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does
not process commands in the subject line.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself.

If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail, Majordomo may
mistakenly believe each line of your message is a command; you will
then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening,
either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature,
or put a line with just the word

	end

on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
processing your signature as bad commands.

Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:

I.	FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM

To get a list of publicly-available mailing lists on this system, put the
following line in the body of your mail message to Majordomo@esrf.fr:

	lists

Each line will contain the name of a mailing list and a brief description
of the list.

To get more information about a particular list, use the "info" command,
supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the name of the list 
about which you wish information is "demo-list", you would put the line

	info demo-list

in the body of the mail message.

II.	SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST

Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
list, so you can begin receiving mailings.

To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:

	subscribe demo-list

If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
(a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears 
in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
the command.  For instance, if you're sending a request from your work
account, but wish to receive "demo-list" mail at your personal account
(for which we will use "jqpublic@my-isp.com" as an example), you'd put
the line

	subscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

in the mail message body.

Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added 
to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification
that an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message
will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may or may not be the
same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a
command found in that message back to Majordomo@esrf.fr.  (This can be
a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra
email by someone who forged requests from your address.)  You may also
get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the list owner
for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about who may
subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list owner
should contact you soon after your request.

Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
list policies and features.  Save this message for future reference; it
will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
to Majordomo@esrf.fr:

	intro demo-list

(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "demo-list").

III.	UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS

Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:

	unsubscribe demo-list

(This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
address is shown in your mail.)

To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
the request, give that address in the command:

	unsubscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

In either of these cases, you can tell Majordomo@esrf.fr to remove
the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
in place of the list name:

	unsubscribe *
	unsubscribe * jqpublic@my-isp.com

IV.	FINDING THE LISTS TO WHICH AN ADDRESS IS SUBSCRIBED

To find the lists to which your address is subscribed, send this command
in the body of a mail message to Majordomo@esrf.fr:

	which

You can look for other addresses, or parts of an address, by specifying
the text for which Majordomo should search.  For instance, to find which
users at my-isp.com are subscribed to which lists, you might send the
command

	which my-isp.com

Note that many list owners completely or fully disable the "which"
command, considering it a privacy violation.

V.	FINDING OUT WHO'S SUBSCRIBED TO A LIST

To get a list of the addresses on a particular list, you may use the
"who" command, followed by the name of the list:

	who demo-list

Note that many list owners allow only a list's subscribers to use the
"who" command, or disable it completely, believing it to be a privacy
violation.

VI.	RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES

Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
may include:
- back issues of the list
- help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
- daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list

To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
command:

	index demo-list

If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines

	get demo-list profile.form
	get demo-list demo-list.9611

in your mail to Majordomo@esrf.fr.

VII.	GETTING MORE HELP

To contact a human site manager, send mail to Majordomo-Owner@esrf.fr.
To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
approval address, which is formed by adding "-approval" to the user-name
portion of the list's address.  For instance, to contact the list owner
for demo-list@esrf.fr, you would send mail to demo-list-approval@esrf.fr.

To get another copy of this help message, send mail to Majordomo@esrf.fr
with a line saying

	help

in the message body.

VIII.	COMMAND SUMMARY FOR ADVANCED USERS

In the description below items contained in []'s are optional. When
providing the item, do not include the []'s around it.  Items in angle
brackets, such as <address>, are meta-symbols that should be replaced
by appropriate text without the angle brackets.

It understands the following commands:

    subscribe [<list>] [<address>]
	Subscribe yourself (or <address> if specified) to the named <list>.
	
    unsubscribe [<list>] [<address>]
	Unsubscribe yourself (or <address> if specified) from the named <list>.
	"unsubscribe *" will remove you (or <address>) from all lists.  This
	_may not_ work if you have subscribed using multiple addresses.

    get [<list>] <filename>
        Get a file related to <list>.

    index [<list>]
        Return an index of files you can "get" for <list>.

    which [<address>]
	Find out which lists you (or <address> if specified) are on.

    who [<list>]
	Find out who is on the named <list>.

    info [<list>]
	Retrieve the general introductory information for the named <list>.

    intro [<list>]
	Retrieve the introductory message sent to new users.  Non-subscribers
	may not be able to retrieve this.

    lists
	Show the lists served by this Majordomo server.

    help
	Retrieve this message.

    end
	Stop processing commands (useful if your mailer adds a signature).

Commands should be sent in the body of an email message to
"Majordomo@esrf.fr" or to "<list>-request@esrf.fr".

The <list> parameter is only optional if the message is sent to an address
of the form "<list>-request@esrf.fr".
 Multiple commands can be processed provided
each occurs on a separate line.

Commands in the "Subject:" line are NOT processed.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact
"Majordomo-Owner@esrf.fr".

Subject: [Rd] Developmental version of Matrix package for R-1.9.0
Message-ID: <6rekti5qno.fsf@bates4.stat.wisc.edu>

I recently uploaded a developmental version of the Matrix package,
Matrix_0.6-1.tar.gz, to CRAN where it is in the
src/contrib/1.9.0/Other directory.  It requires some of the packages
that will appear in R-1.9.0.

This version marks a major redesign of the Matrix package to use S4
classes and methods and to incorporate sparse matrix manipulations
using routines from TAUCS (http://www.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/taucs/),
Metis (http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/) and UMFPACK
(http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack).

Although this package is very much a work in progress and the
documentation is, shall we say, sketchy, there are two vignettes
included with the package.  One of these illustrates the performance
of different ways of performing least squares calculations, using an
example from Koenker and Ng's SparseM package.  The results are, I
think, impressive.

Although not documented in this release, there are the beginnings of
routines to represent large, sparse, pairwise crosstabulations as
sparse matrices.  I am using these in calculations for mixed-effects
models and I understand that others may be interested in them for
other applications.  I would be happy to correspond off-list if you
would like a preview of the capabilities.

Metis is a package for partioning unstructured graphs, partitioning
meshes, and computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices.
Although the entire source code for Metis is included in the Matrix
package I am only using one of the functions for computing
fill-reducing orderings.  Perhaps those who are working on graphical
models may want to look at some of the other capabilities of Metis.
Certainly it provides standard ways of representing and manipulating
unstructured graphs.

I've only compiled and tested the package on Linux_x86 environments.
I will be interested in whether Uwe is successful in building it for
Windows and whether there are problems on 64-bit machines.

Builds OK on OS X, except for

1. The static archives foo.a are not ranlibbed, so you have to do
that manually.

2. Cannot build Matrix.so because it uses flat namespaces and
has multiple definitions of some symbols.

I solved 2 by the usual hack, which is to add the -Xlinker -m flag
to the link by the gcc driver, but the preferred solutions would be
to use external in the code. Or, even better, to switch the Darwin
build to two-level namespaces.

Subject: [Rd] object.size and external references (PR#6506)
Message-ID: <20040130065407.930EA10429@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Richard Beare
Version: 1.8.1
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (130.155.16.102)


I have a package using external references, these are set up as follows

structure(list(.Call("MakeNullImPtr")), class = "image")

The MakeNullImPtr sets up the garbage collection etc

print(unclass(CMAP)) of an image object produces something like this
<pointer: 0x8cf3280>

The bug appears when applying object.size to this sort of object

> object.size(CMAP)
Error in object.size(CMAP) : object.size: unknown type 22

The correct response is debatable - 0, or NA might be appropriate, or perhaps
the real size of the pointer.

I only noticed this problem due to the use of object.size by the "debug"
package.

I don't think Uwe builds on R-devel routinely.  It didn't work for me and 
I will send you a patch when I have resolved this.


It also did not build under Linux (RH8.0 + gcc 3.3.2), as

Metis/proto.h:462: error: conflicting types for `__log2'
/usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h:145: error: previous declaration of `__log2'


It did build on 64-bit Solaris, but failed to load Matrix.so, with

  ld.so.1: /home/markov/ripley/new/R/R64/bin/R.bin: fatal: relocation 
error: file 
/export/staff/ripley/new/R/Matrix.Rcheck/Matrix/libs/Matrix.so: symbol 
isinf: referenced symbol not found

There appears to be an attempted define for this in src/taucs/taucs.h,
but isinf is only used in an earlier define!  Again, patch to follow.


My impression was that the packages you are using had not been written 
very carefully, so there may be a lot more of this sort of thing.

I have started to build on r-devel, but not on a daily basis, and only 
packages in CRAN/src/contrib. I planed to try Doug's package in the 
afternoon, but I'm really busy these days. Nice to hear you are doing 
it, Brian.

Yes, as the above error message suggests, the problem is when
calling  savehistory() inside ESS.

As usual, in these cases, people are encouraged to read the help
page on such a command
... ;-) ... and  ?savehistory contains

  >> Details:

Now it seems not everyone is aware that the readline interface
is turned off for ESS (using "R --no-readline") very much on
purpose -- not only for efficiency reasons, but also (and
mainly) because of very unwanted automagic command completion
behaviour of readline. 

To be honest, I don't see an easy solution to this problem but
am wondering if it was conceivable to enhance the R command line
by allowing to make use of the "history"-part of readline and
disabling everything else.

Subject: [Rd] request for comments --- package "distr" --- S4 Classes for
	Distributions
Message-ID: <401A9E6E.9070105@uni-bayreuth.de>

Hello,

after some discussions with Martin Maechler and Josef Leydold (WU Wien),
we have felt the need for some package that should allow for an 
object-orientated
approach to distributions.

Our small group at Bayreuth now has developed a package "distr" which
tries to fill this gap, implementing distributions by means of  
S4--classes.

A mother class "Distribution" is introduced with slots for a parameter 
and -
most important - for the four constitutive methods "r",  "d", "p", and "q"
(alluding to the corresponding naming already used for these functions 
in S).

All distributions of the " base" package for which such "r",  "d", "p", 
and "q"
functions exist are implemented (essentially by wrappers of the 
origininal code)
as subclasses of  either of the two the subclasses "AbscontDistribution" or
" DiscreteDistribution".

This approach seems very appealing to us from a conceptual viewpoint:

  Just pass an object of some derived distribution class to a generic 
function as
  argument and let the dispatching mechanism decide what to do on run-time.

As an example, we may automatically generate new objects of these classes
with corresponding "r",  "d", "p", and "q"-slots for the laws of r.v.'s 
under
standard mathematical univariate transformations and under convolution of
independent r.v.'s.:
For "Distribution" objects X and Y expressions like 3*X+sin(exp(-Y/4+3))
have their natural interpretation as corresponding image distributions.
To get an impression of what is possible confer the demos on the cited
http-reference below.

Additionally, we also provide classes for a standardized treatment of
simulations (also under contaminations) and evaluations of statistical
procedures on such simulations.

For details we invite the interested R-user /R-developer to

            http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR/

-- or more directly to a detailed manual

           
http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/math/org/mathe7/DISTR/distr.pdf

Before announcing this package to a broader audience, however,
we would be glad to receive some feed-back from a competent audience, 
i.e. you :-)
as to comments and improvements.

In particular, the package is intended to be open for extensions for 
which we
definitely lack the know-how to do it "right", like implementation of 
multivariate
distributions,  conditional distributions and formula for copula.

So anyone who likes to join us in further development is welcome.

In order to at l(e)ast send a running package, we stopped the development
for "release 1" at a certain stage, well having in mind some improvements/
extensions -- c.f. section "Odds and ends" in the manual.

Thank you already for your attention.

Subject: [Rd] Two apparent bugs in aov(y~ *** -1 + Error(***)),
	with suggested (PR#6510)
Message-ID: <20040130192504.30C3D10418@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

I think there are two bugs in aov() that shows up when the right hand
side of `formula' contains both `-1' and an Error() term, e.g.,
aov(y ~ a + b - 1 + Error(c), ...).  Without `-1' or `Error()' there
is no problem.  I've included and example, and the source of aov()
with suggested fixes below.

The first bug (labeled BUG 1 below) creates an extra, empty stratum
inside `Within' in the result list (se example below).

The second bug (BUG 2) assigns the fit of each stratum at one index
too high in the result list; i.e., the fit of stratum 1 is assigned to
`Stratum 2' etc.  `Stratum 1' is NULL.  (Also the extra stratum added
by BUG 1, is NULL.)

Subject: [Rd] Naming difference in cbind between S-Plus (PR#6515)
Message-ID: <20040131212721.4F225F1B2@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

Naming difference in cbind between S-Plus and R.
I think R is wrong.

abc <- data.frame(y=1:4, x=rnorm(4))
abc.lm <- lm(y ~ x, data=abc)
predict.lm(abc.lm, type="terms")  ## this is where R got the name "x"
abc <- cbind(abc, d=abc$y - predict.lm(abc.lm, type="terms"))
abc


R gives
> abc
  y           x        x
1 1 -1.33925477 1.163001
2 2  1.52764505 1.799073
3 3  0.07805628 2.983086
4 4 -0.48720310 4.054840

S-Plus gives

I'm not sure if R is right or wrong, but I suspect the difference
isn't in cbind, it's elsewhere...

>abc.lm <- lm(y ~ x, data=abc)

... in the line above.  In S-PLUS, what does

abc$y - predict.lm(abc.lm, type="terms")

give?  In R it gives a matrix with the column name "x".  It makes
sense to me that using cbind on a matrix with named columns should
keep those column names.  

What does S-PLUS do in this case:

M <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames=list(NULL, c('a', 'b')))
cbind(c=5:6,d=M)

R gives 

> M <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames=list(NULL, c('a', 'b')))
> cbind(c=5:6,d=M)
     c a b
[1,] 5 1 3
[2,] 6 2 4

which seems reasonable to me, though I might like the name "d" to be
incorporated somehow.

>From ?cbind

     For 'cbind' ('rbind') the column (row) names are taken from the
     names of the arguments, or where those are not supplied by
     deparsing the expressions given (if that gives a sensible name).
     The names will depend on whether data frames are included: see the
     examples.

and you cbind-ed a data frame with columns y, x to a data frame with
column x.  It seems to me that what S-PLUS does is equally inconsistent:

abc <- data.frame(y=1:4, x=rnorm(4))
d <- data.frame(x=1:4, e=5:8)

> cbind(abc, d)
  y          x x e
...
> cbind(abc, d=d)
  y          x d.x d.e
...
> cbind(abc, d=d[1])
  y          x d
...
> cbind(abc, d[1])
  y          x x
...

and I would have expected the third to give the name d.x, not d and not x.

Differences from S-PLUS (and please learn to write that correctly!) are 
not per se bugs in R.

It is in cbind and its methods.

It gives an object of class "structure", a matrix with an attribute.

The same as R.  However, the help page for cbind in R explicitly says
matrices and data frames are treated differently.

The difference is that S-PLUS gives

> cbind(abc, d=abc$y - predict.lm(abc.lm, type="terms"))
  y          x        d
1 1  0.3045526 1.143936
2 2 -1.1890024 1.865356
3 3 -1.0242794 2.896081
4 4  0.0401956 4.094628
> cbind(as.matrix(abc), d=abc$y - predict.lm(abc.lm, type="terms"))
  y          x        x
1 1  0.3045526 1.143936
2 2 -1.1890024 1.865356
3 3 -1.0242794 2.896081
4 4  0.0401956 4.094628

without any mention of a difference.
