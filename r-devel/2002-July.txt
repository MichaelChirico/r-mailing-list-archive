The version I downloaded from CRAN contains this file with the correct
contents.  Is this is a local disc-writing problem?

BTW, the version currently on CRAN is dated late on June 18, and *that
one* seems to have the problem, whereas the one I have which was
downloaded earlier that day (and has a June 17 date) does not.

Subject: Assignment operators (was [R] modifying a vector)
Message-ID: <A8877251964B294BAB5BA1FC58B43FED26DCCE@molly.tas.csiro.au>

Bill Venables expected howls of protest about deprecation of underscore for
assign. Here's my one-and-only howl on this point:

(1) I don't like <- as an assignment operator, because it creates an
ambiguity with comparisons: I can write "x+1", "x-1", "x<1" but not "x<-1".
However, I guess it's a bit much to expect the entire R/S community to do
away with "<-" in favour of "_" or Delphi (Pascal) notation ":=", much as it
would delight me; so we're stuck with <- I guess.

(2) "_" strikes me as completely unambiguous. It means assignment, and
that's all it means. For my money, that's more important than aesthetics.
Anyway, if you choose a nice colourscheme, the _ doesn't look that bad. Me,
I like green.

(3) for my remaining bit of money, "=" should not be allowed at all as an
assignment operator: S made a mistake but R doesn't have to.
"="-as-assignment has to be hedged with all sorts of conditions to prevent
ambiguities, and to have an operator which frequently can't be used doesn't
seem helpful. Having it "grudgingly available to the cognoscenti" is not all
that much better!

(4) If deprecation is the first step on the road to removal and to "_" being
allowed in unquoted variable names, then that would be tiresome. I have many
hundreds of functions spanning thousands of lines of S/R code, filled with
"_"s. I really don't want to spend time changing all of them just to solve a
non-problem in R. Which is, I should emphasize, a wonderful piece of
software.

Summary: to lose "_" and gain "=" would be a double whammy with added salt
in the wound.

Subject: SetGeneric and formula interfaces
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0207011205510.12824-100000@artemis>


Hi, 

while playing with the `methods' package I was not able to find what the
recommended way of dealing with the following problem is.

Suppose there is a generic function `foo' and two functions `foo.default'
and `foo.formula', in the classical way:

foo <- function(y, ...) UseMethod("foo")

foo.default <- function(y, ...) {}

foo.formula <- function(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...) {
 ...
 do.call("foo", y=something appropriate,...)
}

If I recall it correctly, foo.formula is the only function that is allowed
to have different arguments than the generic function has (at least by R
CMD check).

Now, using `setGeneric' and `setMethod': 

R> library(methods)
R> 
R> setGeneric("foo", function(y, ...) standardGeneric("foo"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> setMethod("foo", signature(y="numeric"),
+ function(y, ...) print("foo with numeric"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> setMethod("foo", signature(y="formula"),
+ function(y, ...) print("foo with formula"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> foo(x ~ a)
[1] "foo with formula"
R> foo(1:10)
[1] "foo with numeric"

fine. But is it possible to have a method that has an argument `formula'
instead of `y', at least for the sake of compatibility with the classical
way? 

Torsten

There is a simple solution: use the procedures which have long been
described in `Writing R Extensions' to turn your code into properly
formatted canonical code.  (That turns all left-assignments into
`<-', since that is the canonical form.).

It may be a non-problem for you, but it was for the original poster in
the original thread.

Running the following analysis gives as a result kukot vs. kisut.

aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
win.graph()
aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
            sukupuoli=rep(c("kukot","kisut"),
                          c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
    qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

However, running the following analysis, gives miehet vs. miehet.

 aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
 frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
 frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
 win.graph()
 aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

This seems to happen everytime "sukupuoli" contains one variable name, which
starts with a letter "n". If both names start with "n" or other letters the
results is miehet vs naiset as expected.

So this works fine:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("nisset","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

And this also:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","maiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

Where's the problem?

1) This is a report on the lattice package, and we both need you to
mention that and to give the version number of lattice that you used
to be sure of beeing able to reproduce this.

2) It seems that the plots are actually correct, just the labels are
wrong. You can correct that by specifying xlab and ylab in the call.

3) The error appears to be a typo:

    if (missing(ylab))
        ylab <- if (is.f.y)
            unique(levels(y))[y]
        else paste("y:", as.character(unique(levels(y)[[2]])))

should be [2] for consistency.

No.

This is one major difference in the "model" for method dispatch from the
"white book" methods.  The old-style methods are defined to re-match the
arguments to the generic before calling the method.

The formal methods are dispatched by evaluating the _body_ of the method
in the frame of the call to the generic, without rematching arguments.

Aside from potential efficiency, the rationale is that the generic
defines the "meaning" or intention of the function, and the methods are,
literally, different methods to implement that intention.

There's nothing very deep here:  obviously you can say
  setMethod("foo", "formula", function(y, ...)foo.formula(y, ...))

We could even re-define the API so that setMethod did roughly the
equivalent automatically, but on the whole the potential for confusion
seems to outweigh the convenience.

This feature request is already implemented in R-devel.

It is not a bug, as why should logical NA be convertible to any other
format?

Subject: Changes to the methods package
Message-ID: <3D221B02.C5B6CC13@research.bell-labs.com>

A new version was checked in to r-devel today.  These are the main
changes:

1.  Objects from the methods package are no longer copied into base.  As
a result, the behavior of data.class and all.equal should be the same
whether methods are attached or not.  (The methods package no longer
uses data.class.)  Also, detaching the methods package should restore
the behavior of class() to the S3 version.

The change should fix the bugs reported on these two topics.

The downside (perhaps) of the change is that class() and data.class()
will now occasionally be inconsistent when methods is attached. 
class(1:1) is "integer", but data.class(1:1) is "numeric".

2.  The representation of classes is now via an actual class,
"classRepresentation".  The metadata objects for class definitions are
objects from this class.  (Before, the class representation was a
special-purpose hack, partly to avoid bootstrapping problems.)

*** This means that packages using methods need to be installed from
source to make their metadata objects correct.  ****

The change repairs an inconsistency with the green book description
(section 7.6 in particular).

Also, the changes are a step on the way to making classes, like generic
functions, belong to a particular package.  Evenutually one should be
able to deal with the same class name on different packages to refer to
different classes.

3.  Metadata objects have been introduced to represent inheritance
information (both "superclass" extensions and "subclass" relations). 
Subclass information is now maintained in the cached class definitions 
(it's needed to maintain consistency when class relations change).

At the same time, the "extends" relation has been refined, to introduce
the notion of "simple" extensions.

A class extends another in a simple form if either: a) one class
contains another, in the setClass definition; or b) a class extends a
virtual class by a simple setIs declaration.

In the new form, objects can be supplied in certain situations from a
class that is a simple extension of the target class, with no change in
the actual object.  In particular, slots can be assigned without losing
their original class.

The idea here is very similar to the extension previously made to the
API that allowed extending classes to be used as arguments in method
dispatch, without the objects being altered.

There is some discussion of simple extensions and the rationale on the
developer's web page, at
http://developer.r-project.org/simpleExtension.html

Full_Name: Kevin Wright
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Windows 95
Submission from: (NULL) (170.54.59.160)


In the R windows FAQ, item 3.6 (Package TclTk does not work) currently has this
line:

  Sys.putenv("TCL_LIBRARY"="c:/Program Files/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3")

I find that if I execute the following two lines after starting R, I can then do
library(tcltk) and demo(tkdensity) as usual.  I do not need to modify my
autoexec.bat this way!

Anyway, using the following two lines in the FAQ might be useful to some
people.

Sys.putenv("TCL_LIBRARY"="c:/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3")
Sys.putenv("PATH"=paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"),
                        ";c:\\tcl\\bin;",
                        Sys.getenv("R_HOME"),
                        "\\library\\tcltk\\libs",sep=""))

Humbly (and aplogies for any incorrect terminology)

Why do you need that?  In particular, why do you need
.../library/tcltk/libs in the PATH?

Both the README and the FAQ already tell you to put the Tcl/Tk DLLs in
the your path, so why does the information need to be repeated?
Unless something went wrong in your Tcl/Tk installation, they will be in
your path, so why put them in a second time?

Where is the bug?

I think this should be seen as an alternative way to put them in your
path.  Windows documentation is very unclear about how to get
something put into your path.

For example, on my system, tcl is not in my path; I "installed" Tcl/Tk
by just copying the whole directory from another system.  The
Sys.putenv commands make it work.

.../library/tcltk/libs should not be in the PATH: it's misinformation.

Well, a correct command would be better.

Subject: complex numbers in library function (PR#1737)
Message-ID: <200207031225.OAA08552@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Alex Deckmyn
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux Mandrake 7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (193.190.63.62)


A short function in a library contains the complex number -2i :

phihat <- function(x)
  {
x+ (-2i)
  }


If i read the source file with source("phihat") this works fine. If I include it
as
 a function in a library and read it with library(test), the function is still 
read corectly, but when I print it out it shows as

> phihat
function (x)
{
    x + (-0+2i)
}

Internally R still uses (-2i) though:
> phihat(0)
[1] 0-2i

The problem only seems to occur when the function is part of a library. 
When I read the same function via source:

> source("~/software/R-libs/test/R/test")
> phihat
function(x)
  {
x+ (-2i)
  }

Usually I work in emacs using ESS. When I edit the function phihat (Ctrl-C
Ctrl-d)
 I get the bad representation and after reloading the function (ctrl-c ctrl-l) 
the function has changed. quite a dangerous bug, I think, though I admit my
Linux 
version is quite old.

The difference is that in the first case R keeps the source of the
function (in attr(phihat,'source')).  In the second case it deparses
the internal representation.

nchar(NA)
strwidth(NA)
strheight(NA)

Why then do we have as.character(NA)?
Isn't it standard, that a as.something() function can handle NAs? Isn't it
good style to explicitely use as.something(NA) instead of relying on
auto-coercion? Isn't it a language feature that we can assign NA to any element of a
vector, especially if NA is a legal (creatable) element? 

Puzzled

We also have as.character(T) and as.character(F): it's coercion of logicla
vectors which is implemented.

A POSIXct class (say) is not a vector, strictly. The problem is that `NA'
is a _logical_ vector, and although one can reasonably coerce NA, one
cannot coerce T and F.  So it needs special-case code, and I don't think
you will find it documented anywhere that this needs to work.

Subject: R windows FAQ (PR#1733)
Message-ID: <200207031523.RAA10380@pubhealth.ku.dk>


I installed the Tcl/Tk software from www.activestate.com .

The installer did not add the Tcl/Tk DLLs to my PATH.  (Probably it should,
but I don't think the installer provided me with the option of modifying the
PATH.)

I am creating an R package that will be distributed to people who may not
have permission/skill to modify the PATH settings in Windows, so I was
excited to figure out that it was possible to set the PATH after starting R.
(I will do this in the R package)

It was a VERY useful trick for me, which is why I submitted the suggestion.

I may be the only person to find the suggestion useful, in which case it
wouldn't make sense to modify the FAQ.

I think the definitions are different, and they are not #defines.

This comes up all the time with Windows headers.  Usually you need to
include the one you do not need first, then #undef some conflicts
and include the other.  But qglobal is not using a #define, so you can
I think use something like

#include <qt.h>
#define TRUE R_TRUE
#define FALSE R_FALSE
#include <R.h>

I don't see how, except via the above define trick.

Subject: lattice default aspect fails for some data sets (PR#1744)
Message-ID: <200207041901.VAA18450@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Dieter Menne
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Win2000
Submission from: (NULL) (212.185.252.129)


Lattice Version: 0.5-3

There is a problem in print.trellis that can lead to an
error reported as follows:

Error in rep(x$x.between, length = cols.per.page - 1) : 
        invalid number of copies in "rep"
In addition: Warning messages: 
1: argument lengths differ in: split(x, f) 
2: NAs introduced by coercion 

The error only turns up with certain data sets and 
device/aspect ratios and can be tracked down to the following:

    if(x$layout[1]==0) { # using device dimensions to
        ddim <- par("din") # calculate default layout
        device.aspect <- ddim[2]/ddim[1]
        panel.aspect <- if(layout.respect) panel.height else 1

        plots.per.page <- x$layout[2]
##### m can be zero, depending on data
        m <- round(sqrt(x$layout[2] * device.aspect/panel.aspect))
        n <- ceiling(x$layout[2]/m)
        x$layout[1] <- n


Quick Fix (works for me, but not tested with different data sets):

>> replace "round" by "ceiling"

Workaround (always works): Use explicit "aspect".

Subject: nlme: failed augPred with NA in an unused column (PR#1745)

nlme Version: 3.1-27

gsummary fails if any of the columns contains an NA.

 varying <- unlist(lapply(object, function(column, frst) {
        aux <- as.character(column)
        any(aux != aux[frst])
    }, frst = asFirst))
>>    if (any(varying) && (!invariantsOnly)) {

Error in if (any(varying) && (!invariantsOnly)) { : 
        missing value where logical needed

This probably is by design (an more verbose error message would help),
but as a consequence augPred also fails even if
the column is not used at all in the fit.

Jens,

I put a fix in, but it caused other problems and I am now not sure about
this and will revert it.  Thanks for raising the issue, but the answers do
not seem incorrect to me.

If nchar(x) gives the number of characters in the string, then of course
the result should be NA.  However, it seems to be widely used as the
number of characters in the printed representation of a string, when 2
is correct. (E.g. in format.character.)

I am less clear about strwidth and strheight.  In general an NA string
will not be plotted, so 0 seems the appropriate answer, but if it were
plotted the current answer is correct.

Calling strwidth or strheight on a logical vector (and NA is logical)
is correctly an error.

I was trying to print out some text on an  empty PDF graph so that I would
have the statistical data in the same file as the graphs.  I was having
problems in getting the output in a PDF file, but could get it in a
postscript and BMP file.  I put together the script below to see what
'fonts' were available on PDF, is it caused an exception.

point 1 is user error: there are only fonts 1 to 5 documented anywhere
for this device.  pdf() in R-devel has been Holtman-proofed.

point 2 is also user error: the text falls on the boundary of the plot
region.  The PS device can clip partial text, whereas the PDF device
cannot.  Use xpd=TRUE if you want to plot on the edge of the region.

See the comment below.

Sorry I forgot to fix this earlier. I've replaced round with ceiling in the

problems.

There is no bug.  The error message tells you that your function gives a
result of the wrong length - that means your function should give a result
with length the same as that of the input argument, x.

Try either of the following

> integrate(function(x) 1 + 0*x, 0, 1)
> integrate(function(x) rep(1, length(x)), 0, 1)

If you spot the message in these it could be the start of a seminal lesson
on vectorization.

I think people should read the documentation more carefully before sending
e-mail to R-bugs to make sure that they understand their problem correctly.
If in doubt, the problem should be reported to the R-help list.

I do not think there is anything wrong with integrate.  Here is a relevant
excerpt from the man page:

>      f: An R function taking a numeric first argument and returning a
>         numeric vector the same length. Returning a non-finite
>         element will generate an error.

This simply means that the function has to be properly vectorized.  Your
first example - the constant function - is not.  If you replaced it with
something like

      integrate(function(x) rep(1, length(x)), 0, 1)

integrate would work properly.

Your second function works correctly since x^2 returns a vector result of
the same length as x.  The last one is really strange.  I think integrate
should return an error message in this case.

This is user error.  The help for integrate says the first argument is
"An R function taking a numeric first argument and returning a
numeric vector the same length."  

The function has to return a vector answer when a vector argument is
given to it.

>This simply means that the function has to be properly vectorized. 

By the way, sometimes vectorizing is ugly.  Here's a simple function
that should vectorize any function that's designed to take a scalar as
the first argument.

vectorize <- function (f) 
{
  function(x,...)
  { 
     result <- rep(f(x[1],...),length(x))  # this sets type and length
     for (i in 2:length(x)) result[i] <- f(x[i],...)
     result
  }
}

It's slow, and it's ugly, but it lets the original failing example
work:

> integrate(function(x)1,0,1)
Error in integrate(function(x) 1, 0, 1) : evaluation of function gave
a result of wrong length
> integrate(vectorize(function(x)1),0,1)
1 with absolute error < 5.6e-15

--Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
--
--There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
--To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
--Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
--cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
--internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
--This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
--mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
--(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
--and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

Thanks much. I downloaded the source and see the problem. I misinterpreted
the manual as meaning that any function that took a single argument and
returned a single argument would be fine, when the manual and the error
message were trying to tell me that the function should simply be vectorized.
Obvious in retrospect. Sorry to have bothered you about it.
kind regards, -travis porco

thanks--i found this out when i looked at the source. i misinterpreted the
manual. since i had intended the function to take a scalar and return a
scalar, my function seemed to be correct; the intent of the manual page
was to have the user write a vectorized function, as you say, to return a
vector of function values when a vector of argument values is given to it.

Hmm:

  const gint bufsize = 2048;
  gchar buf[bufsize];

is the culprit, so a quick fix should be obvious (just use #define
instead). But is this usage of "const" variables an un-ANSI C
extension in GCC, or is it the HP C compiler that is to blame??

It's not in ANSI C89, though it is in C99.

The initialiser must be a constant expression and in C (but not C++) a
const-qualified variable doesn't qualify.

The reason I've seen for this is that the value of a const-qualfied
variable is known at link time but not necessarily at compile time.

Subject: as.character.octmode() and format.octmode() (PR#1759)
Message-ID: <200207082249.AAA04422@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Henrik Bengtsson
Version: 1.5.1
OS: WinMe
Submission from: (NULL) (217.210.0.243)


PROBLEM:

With

  x <- 0; class(x) <- "octmode"

Should 

  as.character(x)

and

  format(x)

give "" and not "0"?

SUGGESTION/SOLUTION:

Here is one fix that gives "0" instead:

as.character.octmode <- function(x, ...) {
  if (!inherits(x, "octmode"))
    stop("calling wrong method")
  isna <- is.na(x)
  y <- x[!isna]
  ans0 <- character(length(y))
  z <- NULL                          # FIX 01
  while (any(y > 0) | is.null(z)) {  # FIX 02
    z <- y%%8
    y <- floor(y/8)
    ans0 <- paste(z, ans0, sep="")
  }
  ans <- rep(as.character(NA), length(x))
  ans[!isna] <- ans0
  ans
}


Same for format.octmode().

Subject: svd() very slow for wide matrix X but not for t(X) (PR#1761)
Message-ID: <200207091540.RAA08921@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Hi All,

A colleague has just pointed out to me prcomp is *much* slower and memory
intensive when applied to very wide matrixes than when applied to the
transpose of the same matrix.  In looking for the reason, I discovered that
that the singular value decomposition function svd is the primary culprit:

On my Solaris workstation, under R 1.5.1:

	>  nr <- 50
	>  nc <- 1000
	>  x  <- matrix( rnorm( nr*nc), nrow=nr, ncol=nc )
	>  tx <- t(x)
	>
	> # SVD directly on matrix is SLOW
	>  system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 5.41 0.00 5.62 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # SVD directly on t(matrix) is FAST
	>  system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.61 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # but the results are (essentially) identical
	> max( abs(val.x) - abs(val.tx) )
	[1] 4.201361e-13

The speed difference gets worse as the number of columns grows.  

Here is a simple patch to $R_SRC/src/library/base/R/svd.R that works around
the problem.  It simply checks whether the matrix is wider than it is long,
and if so, calls itself on the transpose of the matrix, and then exchanges
the returned u and v matrixes.


*** svd.R.orig Tue Jul  9 11:06:46 2002
--- svd.R Tue Jul  9 11:06:49 2002
***************
*** 5,10 ****
--- 5,17 ----
      n <- dx[1]
      p <- dx[2]
      if(!n || !p) stop("0 extent dimensions")
+ 
+     if( p > n )  # compute on the transpose if wide
+       {
+         s <- svd( t(x), nv=nu, nu=nv)
+         return( d=s$d, u=s$v, v=s$u )
+       }
+     
      if (is.complex(x)) {
          res <- La.svd(x, nu, nv)
          return(list(d = res$d, u = if(nu) res$u, v = if(nv)
Conj(t(res$vt))))


With this patch the speed is almost the same whether called on x or tx:

	> system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 0.62 0.00 0.66 0.00 0.00

	> system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.86 0.00 0.00

	> identical( val.x, val.tx )
	[1] TRUE

This is fine for my purposes, but perhaps someone familiar with the FORTRAN
code should see why its performance is so unbalanced.

This may be of interest:

http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/

It looks like this version may well be more complete and conform the standards than the version that comes with R.

BTW: I am currently patching unix/sys_std.c and modules/gtkconsole.c such that they don't store lines in the history that are identical to the previous line. Is there any interest in posting those patches here?

Peter (and others):

AFAIK, gcc is the only C compiler that allows this sort of fortran-like syntax. Mighty handy, but not portable at all. However, behind the screens, it translates this (more or less) into a call to alloca(). This is a function that is part of most modern systems, and of which portable versions can be found (outside the glibc source tree). BTW: debugging code that allocates arrays like this is not trivial, as on all systems I've seen, you cannot directly access element n as array[n] (from within gdb, that is).

There is a comprehensive whitepaper about gcc's not-portable-outside-gcc quirks available on Metrowerk's site, called Porting GNU C Programs to Metrowerks' CodeWarrior C Compiler.

Variable-length arrays aren't that unpopular an extension.  They are in
the Sun Workshop compiler, for example.

However in this case there *isn't* a variable-length array, it's just a
fixed length array declared by someone who didn't realise that a const
variable isn't a constant expression.

Or, using the canonical scheme for regional CRAN mirrors:

http://cran.au.r-project.org

which seems to work fine (and of course it is identical to
cran.planetmirror.com).

If the diff are relatively small and look good, the chances are
relatively high the inc. will happen.

I think this is a very useful idea -- though I probably will
almost never make use of it, using ESS 99.5% of the time.

Subject: bug in all.equal.character (PR#1767)
Message-ID: <200207101252.OAA13802@pubhealth.ku.dk>

There is a bug in all.equal.character:

> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", "C"))
[1] TRUE
> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))
Error in sum(out) : Object "out" not found
> traceback()
3: sum(out)
2: paste("`is.NA' value mismatches:", sum(is.na(current)), "in current,", 
       sum(out), " in target")
1: all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))
> 

It appears that there is a typo in all.equal.character. "out" is never created.

> all.equal.character
function (target, current, ...) 
{
    lt <- length(target)
    lc <- length(current)
    if (lt != lc) {
        msg <- paste("Lengths (", lt, ", ", lc, ") differ (string compare on first ", 
            ll <- min(lt, lc), ")", sep = "")
        ll <- seq(length = ll)
        target <- target[ll]
        current <- current[ll]
    }
    else msg <- NULL
    nas <- is.na(target)
    if (any(nas != is.na(current))) 
        return(paste("`is.NA' value mismatches:", sum(is.na(current)), 
            "in current,", sum(out), " in target"))
    ne <- !nas & (target != current)
    if (!any(ne) && is.null(msg)) 
        TRUE
    else if (any(ne)) 
        c(msg, paste(sum(ne), "string mismatches"))
    else msg
}
> 

Perhaps "sum(out)" should be "sum(is.na(target))"? That change would lead to:

> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))
[1] "`is.NA' value mismatches: 1 in current, 0  in target"

  The version included in R has been "grafted" from a project called 'wget', 
as far as I have read the comments in vsnprintf.c . Those same comments also 
mention a list of issues, that may have been solved, but maybe not -- I 
haven't tried. It is quite possible that it works well enough as far as R is 
concerned. The version on the link I sent works well too (I use it under 
Irix), and according to its website, it complies to all standards that 
apply. And it *is* free: one can choose between the Artistic License and the 
GPL.

>only if they might be incorporated in to a future version of R  :--)
>If the diff are relatively small and look good, the chances are

  My intention is indeed they *be* incorporated in a future version -- that 
would save me from having to apply the same patch each time R bumps a 
version digit >8-
It sure looks the diffs are going to be small, since (fortunately) adding to 
the history is done in a single place. The terminal version works, the gtk 
version still needs some polishing that I hope to finish today.
What do you mean with looking good?

>I think this is a very useful idea -- though I probably will
>almost never make use of it, using ESS 99.5% of the time.

You'll see just how useful when you do have to step down to the terminal or 
gtk based version :)

Here's the patch. It looks like it does what I want it to do, but I haven't 
yet tried it with multiple-line entries and the like. Please let me know if 
anything turns up that I should look into (I attached it too, in case 
hotmail wraps).

yes.  Definitely a bug introduced by cut&paste (from *.numeric).
It will be fixed in R-patched and R-devel by this night.

Subject: bug(?) in R FAQ - Should I run R from within Emacs? (PR#1772)
Message-ID: <200207110822.KAA17398@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I have a small request re.

R FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions on R
Version 1.5-10, 2002-06-13
ISBN 3-901167-51-X
Kurt Hornik


In section 6.2 Should I run R from within Emacs? The faq says

"Yes, definitely." 

This led me to install emacs, and to install ess. However, I use a windows
environment (mswindows2000) and I had some difficulty installing, linking
and launching these applications. After several hours I had launched emacs
but had failed to link it with either ess or r, partly because of platform
problems. (As a dedicated windows user, I am reluctant to tinker with
autoexec.bat and the like).

I spent several hours doing this, and in hindsight, I decided to uninstall
emacs and ess.
 
I would prefer if the faq could be changed to say:

"This is optional."

And perhaps some comment could be made about platforms. I found the
documentation for emacs and ess to be a bit of a hair-pulling exercise. NOT
one of the "plug and play" applications that MS windows is so fond of! 

By the way, I like the r gui very much. I used splus for some time as a PhD
student, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that my scripts run in r!! I
intend to use r from now onwards, and to encourage my colleagues to use it
too.

Kind regards,

For the cost of one of those plug and play apps that your OS is so
fond of, I'd be happy to provide a simple install.  Would you like to
know where to send your check to?  

(In fact, for XEmacs, we have).

Sure, no problem.  The one I choose is... R!  It's got a simple
install.  Where do you want the check for R's license fee sent?

>(In fact, for XEmacs, we have).

Thanks!  You guys are fast!

So, use the XEmacs InstallShield installer.

Once it's installed, use the tools->packages facility to add ESS.
Use the options->edit init file, add "(require 'ess-site)" (w/o
quotes). 

It works with R. 

Not tested with other tools (i.e. I did nearly exactly this on MacOS
X)

As far as I can see, you never actually link against the tcl/tk
libraries (-ltcl -ltk) so you'd need more stuff in TCLTK_LIBS. Or
maybe simply *not* set it and let configure work it out.

Subject: Minor bug in dlnorm (PR#1781)
Message-ID: <200207121943.VAA26420@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The density of a lognormal should be 0 for negative arguments, but

> dlnorm(-1)
[1] NaN
Warning message: 
NaNs produced in: dlnorm(x, meanlog, sdlog, log) 

A simple fix is to change dlnorm's definition to:

function (x, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1, log = FALSE) 
.Internal(dlnorm(x*(x>0), meanlog, sdlog, log))

It might be faster to put the same sort of adjustment into the
internal code, but I couldn't spot where that lives.

In src/nmath/dlnorm.c.  I fixed it there.

Maybe, but what is in R does what R requires, and has been thoroughly
tested.  I don't propose to do the work again!

8-) Maybe, but what is in R does what R requires, and has been thoroughly
8-) tested.  I don't propose to do the work again!

This is of course entirely up to the judgement of the R-Core members. I can't begin to oversee what subtle formatting documented and undocumented commands R uses, nor how much work it will be to test another version for compliance with R's needs. I have tested only the standard behaviour of the version referenced above, which works, well, standardly, and compilation and using the library was a breeze (on Irix 6.2; there is a thorough test included).
It should be kept in mind however that on most systems where R runs, snprintf c.s. are available, likely in uptodate versions that conform to all or most of the approbriate standards. In other words, they evolve, as R's use of them may, and as the included version will most probably not. This was my main reason to point out the existence of an independent snprintf library that looks like it is being maintained, not some idea R's included version is not up to the task!

I was trying to get the package yags 3.20 by Vince Carey
<stvjc@channing.harvard.edu>
to run, but - after successfull installation -- loading the library failed with
the
message

Those were the facts. R FAQ: Bugs warns against trying to provide an 
explanation for what happens.  However, I was unable to resist trying 
to figure out what was wrong.

There was a duplicated slot name in the yags source code the triggered
this "stop" function, but apparently the 'sep = ""' argument has slipped
out of the parentheses following the 'paste' function and is now an argument
to the 'stop' function instead, which generates the 'unused argument(s)' 
error. This occurs in the function 'representation' in the file 
SClasses.R in the methods directory of the R source. The same typo
occurs in the same function a few lines above it. The following diff
indicates at which lines these 'stop' functions occur:

tykki:~/R-1.5.1/src/library/methods/R# diff  SClasses.R.old SClasses.R
33c33
<         stop(paste("Duplicate class names among superclasses:",
paste(includes[duplicated(includes)], collapse = ", ")), sep="")

collapse="")), sep="")
---
>        stop(paste("Duplicated slot names: ", paste(slots[duplicated(slots)],
collapse=""), sep=""))
---
I am no sure if the 'sep = ""' argument is intended for the first or the
second of the 'paste' functions.


I have separately notified the author of yags about the problem there.

Hello

I had a problem in reading in an EPS file from R into Star Office 5.2 - although
it 
works for several other word processors. The online support at Sun helped me
with the following reply, indicating that the export of EPS from R was faulty.

You might like to update this, at least it would be helpful for Linux/Star
Office users.

Regards

KP

Reply from SUN SUPPORT ->

Hi Kenneth, 
Loading problems with EPS files can appear if in the file format header the file
format information is missing (so-called "Magic"). This can be caused by the
program which exported the EPS file. In this case, please inform the
manufacturer of the program which causes the faulty EPS export. In the TGIF
created EPS files, the first line reads: 

%! 

StarOffice expects however: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0 

If you manually modify the line, StarOffice can read this file without a
problem. 

Hope this helps, 

Sanal

What did you do to make an EPS file?  This would appear to be user error,
not a bug, as R does create the right header when producing EPS files.


Following ?postscript (or using dev.copy2eps) gives

postscript(file="test.eps", width = 4.0, height = 3.0,
           horizontal = FALSE, onefile = FALSE)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

gannet% head test.eps
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Helvetica
...

And if you omit onefile=FALSE, you get

%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Helvetica
...

and *never* %!

Patches will be considered.  No one is currently working on the Windows
GUI, and its originator, Guido Masarotto, is no longer active in R.

(That is probably not easily possible: take a look at the code to see
why: key presses are encoded in 8 bits by Guido's code.)

The outer call.

Thanks.

It might be nice to have stop() take multiple arguments in the same
style as warning() to save  typographical errors for those of us with
parenthesis-dislexia.  Looks like the same one-line addition,
      if(nargs() == 0) message <- NULL else message <- paste(...,
sep="")
would work in stop().

That discrepancy between warning() and stop() has always puzzled me.
I've just altered stop() to allow multiple arguments.

Message-ID: <200207171342.PAA14387@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Carsten Dormann
Version: 1.4.0

Submission from: (NULL) (192.171.129.9)


Hello,

using the function xyplot I repeatedly had R crashing.

One example is from the book of Mick Crawley (Stat. Computing in Splus), where
the commandline reads: xyplot(Weight~Age|Genotype, pch=16)
I also had the same phenomenon with my own data and commands even simpler.

I reinstalled lattice, because on loading the package I got an error message
that the lattice.dll couldn't be found. However that wasn't the cause of the
problem. I downloaded the package again from a different mirror site, all in
vain.
This is the simplest code I could create to crash R with xyplot:
> x_runif(100)
> y_rnorm(100)
> plot(x,y)
> xyplot(y~x)
CRASH!

Best wishes,

Carsten

Try the current version of R: yours is long obselete and I suspect has a
mismatched version of grid.  The current version comes with grid/lattice.

Please read what a bug is and how to report a bug.
With recent versions of R (R-1.4.0 is not recent!), lattice and grid I
cannot reproduce the crash.

Uwe Ligges

BTW: 
- For good reasons, "_" will be depreciated shortly, AFAIK.
- I'd suggest to avoid random numbers for code in bug reports.

Not unless set.seed() is called, I suppose?

hi,

I'm a bit new to R and need a hand importing some data.
I have a data set with jut x,y pairs in it:

x1,y1
x2,y2
x3,y3

I can read it in fine, but I would like to do some cluster analysis on it.
So I'll need to get it the proper data structure. Any ideas?

Thanks,
j.

Subject: Fault in anova.glm (PR#1807)
Message-ID: <200207180650.IAA16820@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When anova.glm is given several models to compare it ignores any prescribed
dispersion parameter.

An example:


> library (MASS)
> cond1 <- c(20, 50, 3, 9, 15, 20) 	
> cond2 <- c(18, 32, 44, 180, 25, 17) 	
> cond3 <- c(4, 11, 12, 44, 15, 6) 	
> testData <- data.frame(res = c(cond1, cond2, cond3),
+        conditions = factor(rep(1:3, c(6,6,6)))) 
> fm <- glm( res ~ conditions, family = negative.binomial(theta = 1),
testData)
> fm0 <- update(fm, .~1)
> anova(fm0, fm, test="Chisq", dispersion = 1)
Analysis of Deviance Table

Model 1: res ~ 1
Model 2: res ~ conditions
  Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance P(>|Chi|)
1        17    16.8979                      
2        15    11.6307  2   5.2672    0.0668

On the other hand:

> 1 - pchisq(5.2672, 2)
[1] 0.07181945
> 

The fix:

Replace line 16 of anova.glm:

        return(anova.glmlist(c(list(object), dotargs), test = test))

by

	return(anova.glmlist(c(list(object), dotargs), 
		dispersion = dispersion, test = test))

eof-----

I have an array of skip values, and the number of lines to read after the skip
values:

skip.lines<-4  #number of lines between task headers
skip.1<-2      #number of lines to the first task header
n.tasks<-10     #number of tasks in the file
n.lines<-1     #number of lines per task (excluding header)

tmp<-seq(1,n.tasks)
skip<- skip.1 + skip.lines * (tmp -1)

# and the read.table is in a loop:

for (i in 1:n.tasks) {
    i.dat<-read.table("tmp.txt",  sep=",", strip.white=TRUE, fill=TRUE,
skip=skip[i], nrows=n.lines, header=FALSE)
    i.name<-substr(names(i.dat)[7],1,4)

    more stuff here
}

When only the first block (first 5 rows) of the file are used, there is no
problem.  When the subsequent blocks are included, R appears to be looking for
more "fields" in the rows 3 and 4 than actually exist.  Changing to header=FALSE
allows me to see all the data, but then I have to transform from character to
numeric and I don't get the names in the data frame.

This script works if the data file has more than one row of data below the
header. (Just cut and paste a data row)

Regards,

michael.

Subject: R-devel Mac OSX build wierdness...
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10207190041300.26875-100000@hsph.harvard.edu>

I encountered some wierdness when building R-devel (latest rsync) on OSX
using commandline tools (as opposed to the Carbon GUI and
whatnot...probably just laziness on my part but it generally works :-)).

At any rate, sometime between 2002-07-05 and the present the configure
scripts started setting INSTALL_DATA to ${R_HOME}/bin/install -c in
Makeconf...which causes wierdness for the Mac OSX (10.1.5) version of sh
(which is actually zsh I believe) as it tries to use INSTALL and make
simply fails. Of course, even with a sensible shell this should fail as
${R_HOME}/bin/install doesn't exist. Changing this to '/usr/bin/install
-c' allowed the build to proceed normally.

I solved this problem by using explicit paths to the libraries in the 
compilation (I think this was the important change).

You can close this bug.

Hard to believe.  The Autoconf code has

[AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_INSTALL])
case "${INSTALL}" in
  [[\\/]]* | ?:[[\\/]]* ) # absolute
    ;;
  *)
    INSTALL="\$\(top_srcdir\)/tools/install-sh -c"
    ;;
esac
])# R_PROG_INSTALL

so either you end up with something absolute or the string in the
default clause.

I assume this is a combination of you putting R_HOME/bin in your PATH
and MacOSX being case-insensitive in some cases?

The problem appears to be with as.POSIXct on the Mac.  Operations that
don't coerce to POSIXct work, those that do, don't.

I think I've found why.

The epoch date on the Mac is 1904-1-1 not 1970-1-1.

This has two effects. First, everything's off by 66 years. Second, it's
important to treat the time as unsigned long, not long, since it's already
greater than 2^31 some time in 1997.

Aren't standards wonderful?

Subject: bug in R-1.5.1 for Mac OS X installer (PR#1825)
Message-ID: <200207222341.BAA05215@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi,

Thanks for developing an outstanding software for free. I admire all your 
effort greatly. I would like to submit a bug report on the R-1.5.1 
installer (in .mpkg, .pkg format) for Mac OS X.

I'm using fink in conjunction with Darwin. In my environment, /usr/local is 
symbolically linked to /sw which is fink's main directory. This is to 
conform the directory structure on my machine to the standard UNIX/Linux 
one.

It turned out that R-1.5.1 installer ignores the symbolic link and creates 
new /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib directories on their own, thereby 
installing all its stuff into them. This is really annoying. (Actually, 
after installing R, bash stopped running. At first, I couldn't figure out 
at all what happened. It turned out that bash failed to runs because it 
lost access dynamic libraries in /usr/local/lib directory.)

I hope the installer properly follows symbolic links during installation.

Cheers,
Kow

Subject: bug in R-1.5.1 for Mac OS X installer (PR#1825)
In-Reply-To: <200207222341.BAA05215@pubhealth.ku.dk>
Message-ID: <03EC4BE7-9DD2-11D6-B3F7-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

Hello

Thanks for the report. Do you have

/usr/local->/sw

or

/sw->/usr/local

i.e. which one of the two only exists as a soft link ? Probably /sw,  
i.e.
fink really installs in /usr/local.

It is generally bad to confound /sw and /usr/local, see

http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/general.php#usr-local

The R installer tries to install in /sw (fink stuff) and in /usr/local
(R stuff). It must get confused when it is trying to locate /sw/lib,
deciding this does not exist, then creating it as /usr/local/lib.
Same for /sw/bin. I don't think there is much I can do about it,
it's what the Installer does. I can warn people.

By the way, where was your bash executable ? This was not
overwritten ?

Subject: sub() and gsub() (PR#1826)

gsub() return different answers depending on how the input
variables were created. Here is an example of code that
replicates the problem. The vectors y and yy appear to be
the same, but gsub() doesn't return the same answer.
It should remove all the blanks when I use the vector y,
but it doesn't remove them all. I have also tested that
the same problem occurs if sub() is used instead of gsub().

x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",
     .Label = c("1 ", "2 ", "3 ", "4 ", "5 "))
y <- as.character(x)
y
gsub(" ","",y)

yy <- c("1 ","3 ","4 ","5 ")
yy
gsub(" ","",yy)


Below is the output that I have when I execute those commands.


> x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",

Those are not blanks!  You have character <A0> in there. less on your
email gives me

> x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",
+      .Label = c("1 ", "2 ", "3 ", "4<A0>", "5<A0>"))

[1] "1 " "3 " "4<A0>" "5<A0>"
> gsub(" ","",y)
[1] "1"  "3"  "4<A0>" "5<A0>"

which is correct.

Pilot error, I believe ....

I can't reproduce this (1.5.1, Debian Linux). I get

[1] TRUE

There used to be a possible bug where the R length and C length of a
string would be different (PR#1724), which might cause that sort of thing,
but the known manifestations of it were removed in 1.5.1

Yes. I immediately noticed it when I viewed my bug report on the 
internet. Those characters appeared blank on my screen before I 
submitted the bug report. I tried to submit a change for this bug, but 
perhaps I don't have the privilege to do so. Sorry about this...

Dear Michael Camann,

My concern was after having a hetero-computing environment for many years, I
found that I had to keep an old version of Microsoft Windows based
applications to be able to interact with my constituents. This at times can
become very expensive. I have had to limit my budget on the UNIX/Linux
platform to compensate for Microsoft Windows based applications.

With Open Office 1.0.1 this is a move in a positive direction. Currently, I
am Sun Microsystems Certified, of which, Sun Microsystems is one of the
contributors to the Open Office 1.0.1 multi-platform application. I am also,
Microsoft Windows Certified along with experience on the HP-UX, IBM AIX,
OS/2, Open Software Foundation, Silicon Graphics, Digital VMS/UNIX (HP),
True 64, Novell, Banyan Vines, BSD, Macintosh and a few others at or above
the level of Certification. But, the problem exists with having to pay for
each platform's certification. As you can see, I am not just limited to two
platforms.

I will just take a step back and let you know that I have been involved with
multi-platform systems for over twenty years, so, I have seen a improvement
over the years. The key factors here are "Cost, Efficiency, Development,
Production and Usability of Fully Functioning Applications!" We need to be
able to get things done and they cannot all be done under a mono-platform.
That is why we have stereo or hetero-computing environments.

We must be able to communicate in stereo and do it on a positive plain. Just
like, 3D or 4D.

I am honored you took time out of your busy scheduled to respond to my
e-mail. It goes to show, we all have a role in life and though it may seem
simplistic by design, on a difference plain it is important. Many thanks,
Michael Camann.

Shawn--

Thought I'd reply simply because I've recently had a similar experience
and thought you might be interested in a slightly different perspective.
I've been running a hetero-computing environment for several years, with
some machines that were dual-boot Linux/MSWindows and others that were
pure Linux but with the Win4Lin kernal installed so that Win98 ran in an
X11 window.  That worked pretty well-- all the usual MSWindows office
software ran (and was stable!) as well as a few vector graphics and data
analysis programs that don't have Linux counterparts.

A couple of recent events on my only 100% Windows computer pissed me off
so badly that I've mostly migrated AWAY for the hetero environment toward
a pure Linux environment.  You're right, OpenOffice was key to being able
to achieve this-- the last StarOffice version (5.2 as I recall) just
wasn't up to the full compatibility task, but SO 6.0 (upon which the OO
code is based) is so far performing just fine.  I do have one computer in
the lab-- a laptop-- that's still dual boot AND has the Win4Lin kernel
just for a few remaining programs that I haven't found replacements for
under Linux, but that number is declining almost daily.  I'm almost ready
to completely migrate to a homogenous Linux environment.  I think I'll
break my Win2K CD's and send them back to Microsoft-- an empty gesture,
but if enough people do it they'll have to get the message....

Best,
Mike C.

Shawn--

Thought I'd reply simply because I've recently had a similar experience
and thought you might be interested in a slightly different perspective.
I've been running a hetero-computing environment for several years, with
some machines that were dual-boot Linux/MSWindows and others that were
pure Linux but with the Win4Lin kernal installed so that Win98 ran in an
X11 window.  That worked pretty well-- all the usual MSWindows office
software ran (and was stable!) as well as a few vector graphics and data
analysis programs that don't have Linux counterparts.

A couple of recent events on my only 100% Windows computer pissed me off
so badly that I've mostly migrated AWAY for the hetero environment toward
a pure Linux environment.  You're right, OpenOffice was key to being able
to achieve this-- the last StarOffice version (5.2 as I recall) just
wasn't up to the full compatibility task, but SO 6.0 (upon which the OO
code is based) is so far performing just fine.  I do have one computer in
the lab-- a laptop-- that's still dual boot AND has the Win4Lin kernel
just for a few remaining programs that I haven't found replacements for
under Linux, but that number is declining almost daily.  I'm almost ready
to completely migrate to a homogenous Linux environment.  I think I'll
break my Win2K CD's and send them back to Microsoft-- an empty gesture,
but if enough people do it they'll have to get the message....

Best,
Mike C.

Dear sir,

This is siva Ginjupalli.

I am getting following error while configuring my Solaris for "R" software.

checking size of int... configure: error: cannot compute sizeof (int), 77.

My solaris information as follows:

I really appreciate if you could guide me to resolve this problem.

Please let me know, if you need config.log file to debug

Hi,

I asked some days ago how to guess the o.s. the machine is running. I
found that it is stored in a variable called  R_PLATFORM. Now I need a
full list of  all the values this variable can have because I need to set
an option  depending on the endianness of the platform in which we are
compiling the package.

 Anyone can help me? Thanks,

I don't think a complete list exists.  I'd suggest running R to find
out:  Platform()$endian gives the result you need, so something like
this works in Windows:

 echo cat(Platform()$endian) | Rterm --slave

R_PLATFORM is used set in etc/Renviron.  You can't find a complete
list, as R can be compiled on new platforms.  In any case, a user could
change the value.

The information you want is in the Rconfig.h header file, in
/* #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
which is uncommented on big-endian systems.

This *is* documented in `Writing R Extensions'.  From R code, look at
.Platform$endian.

Platform() is to be deprecated in the next release: please use
.Platform$endian instead.

The line

looks like it has problems for p near 1.  I would suggest rewriting it to

    return log1p (-p) * (x + 1);

I don't think that helps for p near 1. It might do so for p near 0,
though. (The whole thing is a bit esoteric since it only becomes
relevant when you want the upper tail and on a log scale.)

Could you give us an example of the problems please?  Otherwise how
will we know that we have solved them?

>     return log1p (-p) * (x + 1);

Please report the bug (see BUGS in the FAQ) and not the solution.  It
seems to me to be working fine for p as small as 10^(-8) which is already
way beyond a feasible application of a geometric (as an exponential would
be used instead).

Uwe,

The titles are not necessarily intended to be aliases.  units.Rd is
another one.  Once upon a time \title automatically generated a \alias,
but not for some time (and I've forgotten the reasoning).

I think this is confusing, as help.search shows the entry as Random(base)
but ?Random does not work.  On the other hand, ?Binomial does work, and
there is no object Binomial.  My preference would be to change
help.search, I think.

In any case, this is not an isolated instance.

Brian

Subject: R 1.5.1 (Windows) crashes on plotting density(rnorm(1000)) (PR#1837)
Message-ID: <200207261416.QAA24871@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I am experiencing a reproducible crash from the following statement:

plot(density(rnorm(1000)))

on R 1.5.1 on Windows 2000.

This is a dual-processor machine with 512Mb of RAM.  Please advise if 
further details of hardware/OS are needed.

If rgui.exe is in use, the crash occurs before the plot can be 
displayed.  If rterm.exe is in use, the plot appears, then the error (and 
crash).

A screen capture of the error dialog box  can be viewed/downloaded at

http://shrimp.ccfhrb.noaa.gov/~mprager/rcrash.png

I happen to have Compaq Fortran installed, and therefore a debugger appears 
after the crash.  As I know nothing about systems programming, the debugger 
information (assembler) is meaningless to me, but if it would be useful, I 
can reproduce the crash, save the debugger information, and send it along.

This seems similar to crashes experienced in S-Plus that have been 
attributed to that program's assuming certain behavior on illegal math 
operations, behavior reportedly reset by HP printer drivers.  I do have an 
HP printer installed (hardly avoidable in the PC world).  But that 
observation may be totally irrelevant.

Thanks!

   Could you give us an example of the problems please?  Otherwise how
   will we know that we have solved them?

Visual inspection.  The problem is that the original code performs an
operation, "1-p", with the potential of killing all precision.  Often
that cannot be helped, but here the function log1p exists as a counterpart
to log in order to solve this very problem.

   Please report the bug (see BUGS in the FAQ) and not the solution.  It
   seems to me to be working fine for p as small as 10^(-8) which is already
   way beyond a feasible application of a geometric (as an exponential would
   be used instead).

It is entirely likely that such values are unreasonable, but that is still
not a great reason for returning terrible results for something that is at
least theoretically sane.  The actual point where problems occur is going
to depend on your floating point hardware.  For me, p=1e-17 makes the old
version return zero (fundamentally wrong) and the new version non-zero.

Note, that variations of "log (1-p)" exist in other functions, such as
pbeta_raw.

But for p near 1 (you give near 0 below) the distribution is concentrated
almost entirely on a single point.

That's nowhere near one!

I think this amounts to

`if I were to do really silly things numerical inaccuracies might catch up
with me'.

That's true throughout R, but we do have better things to worry about.

How can a random result be reproducible?  You could have told us the seed
in use!   I've tried this ten times without a crash, on two separate
machines, one XP and one 2000.

There is advice on how to do this in a usable way in the rw-FAQ.

R is already well-protected against that HP bug (which does not occur on
WIndows 2000 BTW, and was discovered by me under Win98), and I do have an
HP printer installed.

I just tried it in a single processor WinXP machine, with no error.
It's conceivable that the value of the random seed has an effect, but
it's more likely something else.

The invalid operation error can definitely be triggered by code that
messes with the floating point control word.  I hadn't heard that
printer drivers do this, but it is common in video drivers.  Could you
check that you have the latest video driver (and printer driver)
installed?

I don't know an easy way to diagnose this error remotely.

Not \title, but \name.  This is how we started out.  We then realized
that e.g. we cannot have .Script.Rd so now we separate the name of the
documentation object from the topics it provides documentation for.

I do not see what is confusing.  Rd writers create a help file and use
\alias to register the topics documented.  We cannot assume that the
file name is a topic documented, see zScript.Rd which documents .Script.

Why should 'Random' be a topic documented?

help.start() has a bug because it incorrectly assumes that we can get
help on the name.  I will fix this by instead pointing to the *first*
alias in the documentation object.

Subject: predict() still not yet "safe".. (PR#1840)
Message-ID: <200207261812.UAA25583@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Executive Summary: This only concerns  predict() at new points
	  when the formula contained things like poly() or ns() {in the RHS}.

Because I hadn't have time to fix this yet, I submit it.
[R version 1.5.1 and at least 1.4.1, probably all versions at all:]
For these, R 1.5.x does not differ from 1.4.1 : Inspite of R
1.5.0's "NEWS" entry and the ?Safepredict help page, 
predict() doesn't (always?) work correctly for (some cases of)
   predict(lm(y ~  poly(....)), newdata = .....)
or
   predict(lm(y ~  ns(....)),   newdata = .....)

Here is a simple (longer than necessary) example 

#### This modified from the last part of  example(cars) {of R 1.5.1}:

data(cars)
## An example of polynomial regression
## -- to show the bug, the linear example is sufficient
cars.1 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 1), data = cars)
cars1  <- lm(dist ~      speed,              data = cars)# the `same'
all.equal(predict(cars.1), predict(cars1))# the fitted values are ok

cars.4 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 4), data = cars)
newd <- data.frame(speed = d <- seq(0, 25, length = 51)) # shorter than in ?cars
pr1d <- predict(cars.1, newd)
pr4d <- predict(cars.4, newd)

plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))
abline(cars1, col = "blue")# the correct one
## in R 1.5.0 and 1.5.1, these look wrong (particularly to the left!):
lines(d, pr1d)
lines(d, pr4d, col = "red")

## or see by simple prediction at one point
predict(cars1,  data.frame(speed = 4)) # -1.84946
predict(cars.1, data.frame(speed = 4))
## --> Error in poly(speed, degree = 1) :
##          degree must be less than number of points

Right.

Well, Random is listed at several places, e.g. in the result of
 help.search("random")  : # ..., Random(base), ...
So, at least for me, it is confusing trying ?Random after that.

Agreed, but why not \name ?

As Martin pointed out, not only help.start() has this "bug"(?).

I think it is not a bad idea to get help with ?NAME , if NAME is listed
anywhere else ...

I think Kurt is already allowing that as confusing.

We need \name to hyperlink correctly. This came about originally because
of Windows file name restrictions, and later Kurt's example came up on
some MacOS variant.

Agreed, but my solution was to not use NAME anywhere else.  I don't have a
problem with the Java search, as clicking on the item works.

There is a side issue. Is `Random' a reasonable help topic?  Probably not
(ditto Binomial) but `random' probably is.

Subject: diagonals of tensors
Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.44.0207261153230.62952-100000@homer30.u.washington.edu>



 Is there a simple and efficient way of extract `diagonals' from arrays
(tensors)

That is, suppose  A is a 20x10x2 array, B is 10x5 and C is 20x5 I would
like the 2x5 matrix whose i,j entry is

      sum_k sum_l  A(k,l,i)B(l,j)C(k,j)


Using tensor() (or outer and matrix multiplication) it's easy to construct
the 2x5x5 matrix with i,j,J entry

       sum_k sum_l  A(k,l,i)B(l,j)C(k,J)

[eg tensor(tensor(A,B,2,1),C,1,1) ]
and I'm looking for the j==J `diagonal', ideally without constructing the
whole thing.

I've met similar problems, independently.
The bug tracking list does not tell that is already done.

I've attached a patch file and the modified read.table.R.
Hope it helps. However, it is not intensively tested.

Cheers,
Martin

[Forwarded to r-bugs, since the docs say that f can be a list in all
the split-related functions]

Thanks for pointing this out. I think your code should work, although
I'm slightly uneasy about actually modifying f, so how about

        len <- length(if (is.list(f)) f[[1]] else f)
        x <- vector(mode = typeof(value[[1]]), length = len)

?

By the way, I see that split.default starts with 

    if (is.list(f)) 
        f <- factor(do.call("interaction", f))

What is the reason (if any) why this cannot just be f <-
interaction(f) ? If there is one, then it is likely that you would
have to do the same in unsplit.

Calling with separate factors is what is actually documented for
interaction.  The code for interaction shows that passing the arguments as
a list also works, and has since Dec 98.  I'll alter interaction.Rd.

Just curious, why are you uneasy about that? Does it have side effects?

>         len <- length(if (is.list(f)) f[[1]] else f)

The reason I used the interaction() call is that this seems to work too:

 > split(1:10,list(a=1:2,b=1:5))

So, lists with unequal lengths.

It is largely due superstition, but if you change f before calling
split<-() you have split() and split<-() called with different f's
even if the same f is used for split() and unsplit(). That can be
quite OK, but there's a marginal risk that it causes an inconsistency
somewhere so that the split and unsplit aren't exact inverses.

But does it work??

OK, I understand. Thanks for explaining.

You're right, it doesn't work. I was a bit blinded by the fact that

split(1:10,list(a=1:2,b=1:2))

did what I expected, although I now understand that I should not rely on 
these results. Should have payed more attention to the help pages and 
the warnings.

Subject: R Code for X-Tab with Row/Col Proportions, Expected Vals and Tests
Message-ID: <006601c23685$b499e510$0201a8c0@MARC>


Recently, I noted a post and replies on R-Help from Professor Marc
Feldesman regarding a cross tabulation function that generates row and
column proportions, marginal values, expected cell values and tests for
independence presumably similar in a fashion to the output of the S-Plus
crosstabs() function or SAS Proc Freq.

Martin Maechler had posted some code in reply for folks to update and
translate.  

In parallel, out of my own needs for something functionally similar, I
have been working for a while on a function that takes either a
two-dimensional matrix or two vectors and generates just such a table,
with output similar to the aforementioned S-Plus/SAS functions.  Column
widths are adjusted based upon the dimnames and the digits argument and
the printed table is labeled with vector names if used.

The code for the function is below.  If anyone wishes me to e-mail a
text file containing the code, let me know.

My goal would be to make this available to the R community as open
source, either independently or perhaps if deemed appropriate, as a base
function.

I would appreciate any constructive criticism of the code itself or the
output. My guess is that there may be more efficient means of performing
some of the manipulations and/or perhaps being consistent with core R
coding and output standards.

If there are any suggestions for improvement, I would be more than happy
to incorporate these and make them available to the community.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to any feedback.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

Recently, I noted a post and replies on R-Help from Professor Marc
Feldesman regarding a cross tabulation function that generates row and
column proportions, marginal values, expected cell values and tests for
independence presumably similar in a fashion to the output of the S-Plus
crosstabs() function or the SAS Proc Freq.

Martin Maechler had posted some code in reply for folks to update and
translate.

In parallel, out of my own needs for something functionally similar, I
have been working for a while on a function that takes either a
two-dimensional matrix or two vectors and generates just such a table,
with output similar to the aforementioned S-Plus/SAS functions.  The
code for the function is attached.

My goal would be to make this available to the R community as open
source, either independently or perhaps if deemed appropriate, as a base
function.

I would appreciate any constructive criticism of the code itself or the
output. My guess is that there may be more efficient means of performing
some of the manipulations and/or perhaps being consistent with R coding
and output standards.

If there are any suggestions for improvement, I would be more than happy
to incorporate these and make them available to the community.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to any feedback.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

The function quantile, in base, sometimes gives incorrect results
and is unnecessarily complicated.  For example,

> x <- c(-Inf, -Inf, Inf, Inf)
> quantile(x)
  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
-Inf -Inf -Inf  Inf  Inf

The correct result is
 0%  25%  50%  75%  100%
-Inf -Inf    NaN    Inf     Inf

Here the calculation at probs = 0.5 is
    50% quantile = x[2] + 0.5 * (x[3] - x[2])
                       = -Inf + 0.5 * (Inf - (-Inf))
                       = -Inf + Inf
                       = NaN

The responsible code is:

n <- length(x)
np <- length(probs)
if(n > 0 && np > 0) {
index <- 1 + (n - 1) * probs
lo <- floor(index)
hi <- ceiling(index)
x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))
i <- index > lo
qs <- x[lo]
    i <- seq(along=i)[i & !is.na(i)][qs[i] > -Inf]
    .minus <- function(x,y) ifelse(x == y, 0, x - y)# ok for Inf - Inf
    qs[i] <- qs[i] + .minus(x[hi[i]], x[lo[i]]) * (index[i] - lo[i])
}

I suggest:

n <- length(x)
np <- length(probs)
If(n > 0 && np > 0){
    index <- 1 + (n - 1) * probs
    lo <- pmin(floor(index), n - 1)
    hi <- lo + 1
    x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))
    qs <- x[lo]
    dif <- ifelse(x[hi] != qs, x[hi] - qs, 0) # Avoid Inf-Inf NaN.
    qs <- ifelse((fac <- location - k) != 0, qs + fac * dif, qs)
}

Subject: Optim() returns wrong maximum
Message-ID: <3D466034.ED2C7EFF@lancs.ac.uk>

Dear R-devel

During the last half a year I have several times encountered the
following problem with optim() when using method= "L-BFGS-B". 

The function return a value which is clearly not the maximum (seen from
printing the value each time the function is called). Some output is
shown below.

A few things I have observed (as I remember it):

a. The problem seems to occur when the last function call is for a value
on the boundary.

b. The problem also seems to occur more frequently in cases where the
function providing the gradient is mis-specified.


I have deliberately not provided code such that you can reproduce the
behaviour. The reason being that these functions are complicated  and
involves a lot of input (data, fixed parameters, etc).


Someone might spot the problem based on the information I have given
(possibly a bug in optim() ?).
In case not, I would like to ask if anyone has observed similar problems
?. 
This may help me to construct a more simple example, which I could then
submit with reproducible code.

Hi Ole,

I have encountered similar problems.
Even more, the parameters are not always 
within the given bounds (for method= "L-BFGS-B")
The values are then only an epsilon outside,
but it can be very disturbing nonetheless.

Cheers,
Martin

PS: the MLE algorithm in my contributed package 
    `RandomFields' is written such that it
    gets around with these two problems of optim

Hello,

 I think the best option isd the one proposed by Mr. Ripley. We have added
some C and the package compiles fine on Sun machines, and it should do
on other Big Endian machines.

 Thanks to all for your comments,

Subject: Unable to install new package using local zip file (PR#1854)
Message-ID: <200207302124.XAA14249@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jagadish Rangrej
Version: 1.5.1
OS: windows 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (192.139.231.5)


I have produced one package using 
>Rcmd install pubbias (pubbias is the name of pkg),
to move it to any new computer, I take the zip file of, "Program
file\R\rw1051\library\pubbias" and install it using menu option in R for
installing from local zip files.

It gives the error : "error -1 in extracting from zip file"

solved :
before installing using menu option, go to "program files\R\rw1051\library" and
make a directory "pubbias", then install the package from the local zip file
option.

Thanks,
-Jag

There is nothing here that we could reproduce.

The option does work: download any of the zip files on CRAN and try it.
(Indeed, the same code is used by the option to install from CRAN, and we
have had no reports of problems.)

Two possible issues spring to mind:

1) the zip file might have invalid internal structure.  Maybe it is
missing the directory `pubbias' (although the unzip code should cope with
that, and that's not the error code I would expect).

2) This is not the first attempt to do something like this, and Windows
had the location in use.  (I have seen that one, and after a reboot it
worked cleanly.)

The version I downloaded from CRAN contains this file with the correct
contents.  Is this is a local disc-writing problem?

BTW, the version currently on CRAN is dated late on June 18, and *that
one* seems to have the problem, whereas the one I have which was
downloaded earlier that day (and has a June 17 date) does not.

Subject: Assignment operators (was [R] modifying a vector)
Message-ID: <A8877251964B294BAB5BA1FC58B43FED26DCCE@molly.tas.csiro.au>

Bill Venables expected howls of protest about deprecation of underscore for
assign. Here's my one-and-only howl on this point:

(1) I don't like <- as an assignment operator, because it creates an
ambiguity with comparisons: I can write "x+1", "x-1", "x<1" but not "x<-1".
However, I guess it's a bit much to expect the entire R/S community to do
away with "<-" in favour of "_" or Delphi (Pascal) notation ":=", much as it
would delight me; so we're stuck with <- I guess.

(2) "_" strikes me as completely unambiguous. It means assignment, and
that's all it means. For my money, that's more important than aesthetics.
Anyway, if you choose a nice colourscheme, the _ doesn't look that bad. Me,
I like green.

(3) for my remaining bit of money, "=" should not be allowed at all as an
assignment operator: S made a mistake but R doesn't have to.
"="-as-assignment has to be hedged with all sorts of conditions to prevent
ambiguities, and to have an operator which frequently can't be used doesn't
seem helpful. Having it "grudgingly available to the cognoscenti" is not all
that much better!

(4) If deprecation is the first step on the road to removal and to "_" being
allowed in unquoted variable names, then that would be tiresome. I have many
hundreds of functions spanning thousands of lines of S/R code, filled with
"_"s. I really don't want to spend time changing all of them just to solve a
non-problem in R. Which is, I should emphasize, a wonderful piece of
software.

Summary: to lose "_" and gain "=" would be a double whammy with added salt
in the wound.

Subject: SetGeneric and formula interfaces
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0207011205510.12824-100000@artemis>


Hi, 

while playing with the `methods' package I was not able to find what the
recommended way of dealing with the following problem is.

Suppose there is a generic function `foo' and two functions `foo.default'
and `foo.formula', in the classical way:

foo <- function(y, ...) UseMethod("foo")

foo.default <- function(y, ...) {}

foo.formula <- function(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...) {
 ...
 do.call("foo", y=something appropriate,...)
}

If I recall it correctly, foo.formula is the only function that is allowed
to have different arguments than the generic function has (at least by R
CMD check).

Now, using `setGeneric' and `setMethod': 

R> library(methods)
R> 
R> setGeneric("foo", function(y, ...) standardGeneric("foo"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> setMethod("foo", signature(y="numeric"),
+ function(y, ...) print("foo with numeric"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> setMethod("foo", signature(y="formula"),
+ function(y, ...) print("foo with formula"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> foo(x ~ a)
[1] "foo with formula"
R> foo(1:10)
[1] "foo with numeric"

fine. But is it possible to have a method that has an argument `formula'
instead of `y', at least for the sake of compatibility with the classical
way?

There is a simple solution: use the procedures which have long been
described in `Writing R Extensions' to turn your code into properly
formatted canonical code.  (That turns all left-assignments into
`<-', since that is the canonical form.).

It may be a non-problem for you, but it was for the original poster in
the original thread.

Running the following analysis gives as a result kukot vs. kisut.

aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
win.graph()
aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
            sukupuoli=rep(c("kukot","kisut"),
                          c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
    qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

However, running the following analysis, gives miehet vs. miehet.

 aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
 frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
 frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
 win.graph()
 aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

This seems to happen everytime "sukupuoli" contains one variable name, which
starts with a letter "n". If both names start with "n" or other letters the
results is miehet vs naiset as expected.

So this works fine:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("nisset","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

And this also:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","maiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

Where's the problem?

1) This is a report on the lattice package, and we both need you to
mention that and to give the version number of lattice that you used
to be sure of beeing able to reproduce this.

2) It seems that the plots are actually correct, just the labels are
wrong. You can correct that by specifying xlab and ylab in the call.

3) The error appears to be a typo:

    if (missing(ylab))
        ylab <- if (is.f.y)
            unique(levels(y))[y]
        else paste("y:", as.character(unique(levels(y)[[2]])))

should be [2] for consistency.

No.

This is one major difference in the "model" for method dispatch from the
"white book" methods.  The old-style methods are defined to re-match the
arguments to the generic before calling the method.

The formal methods are dispatched by evaluating the _body_ of the method
in the frame of the call to the generic, without rematching arguments.

Aside from potential efficiency, the rationale is that the generic
defines the "meaning" or intention of the function, and the methods are,
literally, different methods to implement that intention.

There's nothing very deep here:  obviously you can say
  setMethod("foo", "formula", function(y, ...)foo.formula(y, ...))

We could even re-define the API so that setMethod did roughly the
equivalent automatically, but on the whole the potential for confusion
seems to outweigh the convenience.

This feature request is already implemented in R-devel.

It is not a bug, as why should logical NA be convertible to any other
format?

Subject: Changes to the methods package
Message-ID: <3D221B02.C5B6CC13@research.bell-labs.com>

A new version was checked in to r-devel today.  These are the main
changes:

1.  Objects from the methods package are no longer copied into base.  As
a result, the behavior of data.class and all.equal should be the same
whether methods are attached or not.  (The methods package no longer
uses data.class.)  Also, detaching the methods package should restore
the behavior of class() to the S3 version.

The change should fix the bugs reported on these two topics.

The downside (perhaps) of the change is that class() and data.class()
will now occasionally be inconsistent when methods is attached. 
class(1:1) is "integer", but data.class(1:1) is "numeric".

2.  The representation of classes is now via an actual class,
"classRepresentation".  The metadata objects for class definitions are
objects from this class.  (Before, the class representation was a
special-purpose hack, partly to avoid bootstrapping problems.)

*** This means that packages using methods need to be installed from
source to make their metadata objects correct.  ****

The change repairs an inconsistency with the green book description
(section 7.6 in particular).

Also, the changes are a step on the way to making classes, like generic
functions, belong to a particular package.  Evenutually one should be
able to deal with the same class name on different packages to refer to
different classes.

3.  Metadata objects have been introduced to represent inheritance
information (both "superclass" extensions and "subclass" relations). 
Subclass information is now maintained in the cached class definitions 
(it's needed to maintain consistency when class relations change).

At the same time, the "extends" relation has been refined, to introduce
the notion of "simple" extensions.

A class extends another in a simple form if either: a) one class
contains another, in the setClass definition; or b) a class extends a
virtual class by a simple setIs declaration.

In the new form, objects can be supplied in certain situations from a
class that is a simple extension of the target class, with no change in
the actual object.  In particular, slots can be assigned without losing
their original class.

The idea here is very similar to the extension previously made to the
API that allowed extending classes to be used as arguments in method
dispatch, without the objects being altered.

There is some discussion of simple extensions and the rationale on the
developer's web page, at
http://developer.r-project.org/simpleExtension.html

Full_Name: Kevin Wright
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Windows 95
Submission from: (NULL) (170.54.59.160)


In the R windows FAQ, item 3.6 (Package TclTk does not work) currently has this
line:

  Sys.putenv("TCL_LIBRARY"="c:/Program Files/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3")

I find that if I execute the following two lines after starting R, I can then do
library(tcltk) and demo(tkdensity) as usual.  I do not need to modify my
autoexec.bat this way!

Anyway, using the following two lines in the FAQ might be useful to some
people.

Sys.putenv("TCL_LIBRARY"="c:/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3")
Sys.putenv("PATH"=paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"),
                        ";c:\\tcl\\bin;",
                        Sys.getenv("R_HOME"),
                        "\\library\\tcltk\\libs",sep=""))

Humbly (and aplogies for any incorrect terminology)

Why do you need that?  In particular, why do you need
.../library/tcltk/libs in the PATH?

Both the README and the FAQ already tell you to put the Tcl/Tk DLLs in
the your path, so why does the information need to be repeated?
Unless something went wrong in your Tcl/Tk installation, they will be in
your path, so why put them in a second time?

Where is the bug?

I think this should be seen as an alternative way to put them in your
path.  Windows documentation is very unclear about how to get
something put into your path.

For example, on my system, tcl is not in my path; I "installed" Tcl/Tk
by just copying the whole directory from another system.  The
Sys.putenv commands make it work.

I'd rather not rebuild the distribution, because something else would
probably go wrong, so I've put the missing file on CRAN, soon to
appear at

 <http://www.cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/dynload.html>. 

 If you use HTML help, you can download just that file and replace the
defective $RHOME/library/base/html/dynload.html.

.../library/tcltk/libs should not be in the PATH: it's misinformation.

Well, a correct command would be better.

Subject: complex numbers in library function (PR#1737)
Message-ID: <200207031225.OAA08552@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Alex Deckmyn
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux Mandrake 7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (193.190.63.62)


A short function in a library contains the complex number -2i :

phihat <- function(x)
  {
x+ (-2i)
  }


If i read the source file with source("phihat") this works fine. If I include it
as
 a function in a library and read it with library(test), the function is still 
read corectly, but when I print it out it shows as

> phihat
function (x)
{
    x + (-0+2i)
}

Internally R still uses (-2i) though:
> phihat(0)
[1] 0-2i

The problem only seems to occur when the function is part of a library. 
When I read the same function via source:

> source("~/software/R-libs/test/R/test")
> phihat
function(x)
  {
x+ (-2i)
  }

Usually I work in emacs using ESS. When I edit the function phihat (Ctrl-C
Ctrl-d)
 I get the bad representation and after reloading the function (ctrl-c ctrl-l) 
the function has changed. quite a dangerous bug, I think, though I admit my
Linux 
version is quite old.

The difference is that in the first case R keeps the source of the
function (in attr(phihat,'source')).  In the second case it deparses
the internal representation.

I guess, all of the following should return NA

nchar(NA)
strwidth(NA)
strheight(NA)

Best 


Jens Oehlschlägel



## this is correct
nchar("NA")

# but this is wrong since 1.5.0
nchar(NA)
nchar(as.character(NA))


# same problems with strwidth() strheight()
plot(1)
strwidth("NA")
strwidth(NA)
strwidth(as.character(NA))

strheight("NA")
strheight(NA)
strheight(as.character(NA))

Why then do we have as.character(NA)?
Isn't it standard, that a as.something() function can handle NAs? Isn't it
good style to explicitely use as.something(NA) instead of relying on
auto-coercion? Isn't it a language feature that we can assign NA to any element of a
vector, especially if NA is a legal (creatable) element? 

Puzzled

We also have as.character(T) and as.character(F): it's coercion of logicla
vectors which is implemented.

A POSIXct class (say) is not a vector, strictly. The problem is that `NA'
is a _logical_ vector, and although one can reasonably coerce NA, one
cannot coerce T and F.  So it needs special-case code, and I don't think
you will find it documented anywhere that this needs to work.

Subject: R windows FAQ (PR#1733)
Message-ID: <200207031523.RAA10380@pubhealth.ku.dk>


I installed the Tcl/Tk software from www.activestate.com .

The installer did not add the Tcl/Tk DLLs to my PATH.  (Probably it should,
but I don't think the installer provided me with the option of modifying the
PATH.)

I am creating an R package that will be distributed to people who may not
have permission/skill to modify the PATH settings in Windows, so I was
excited to figure out that it was possible to set the PATH after starting R.
(I will do this in the R package)

It was a VERY useful trick for me, which is why I submitted the suggestion.

I may be the only person to find the suggestion useful, in which case it
wouldn't make sense to modify the FAQ.

I think the definitions are different, and they are not #defines.

This comes up all the time with Windows headers.  Usually you need to
include the one you do not need first, then #undef some conflicts
and include the other.  But qglobal is not using a #define, so you can
I think use something like

#include <qt.h>
#define TRUE R_TRUE
#define FALSE R_FALSE
#include <R.h>

I don't see how, except via the above define trick.

Subject: lattice default aspect fails for some data sets (PR#1744)
Message-ID: <200207041901.VAA18450@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Dieter Menne
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Win2000
Submission from: (NULL) (212.185.252.129)


Lattice Version: 0.5-3

There is a problem in print.trellis that can lead to an
error reported as follows:

Error in rep(x$x.between, length = cols.per.page - 1) : 
        invalid number of copies in "rep"
In addition: Warning messages: 
1: argument lengths differ in: split(x, f) 
2: NAs introduced by coercion 

The error only turns up with certain data sets and 
device/aspect ratios and can be tracked down to the following:

    if(x$layout[1]==0) { # using device dimensions to
        ddim <- par("din") # calculate default layout
        device.aspect <- ddim[2]/ddim[1]
        panel.aspect <- if(layout.respect) panel.height else 1

        plots.per.page <- x$layout[2]
##### m can be zero, depending on data
        m <- round(sqrt(x$layout[2] * device.aspect/panel.aspect))
        n <- ceiling(x$layout[2]/m)
        x$layout[1] <- n


Quick Fix (works for me, but not tested with different data sets):

>> replace "round" by "ceiling"

Workaround (always works): Use explicit "aspect".

nlme Version: 3.1-27

gsummary fails if any of the columns contains an NA.

 varying <- unlist(lapply(object, function(column, frst) {
        aux <- as.character(column)

This probably is by design (an more verbose error message would help),
but as a consequence augPred also fails even if
the column is not used at all in the fit.

Jens,

I put a fix in, but it caused other problems and I am now not sure about
this and will revert it.  Thanks for raising the issue, but the answers do
not seem incorrect to me.

If nchar(x) gives the number of characters in the string, then of course
the result should be NA.  However, it seems to be widely used as the
number of characters in the printed representation of a string, when 2
is correct. (E.g. in format.character.)

I am less clear about strwidth and strheight.  In general an NA string
will not be plotted, so 0 seems the appropriate answer, but if it were
plotted the current answer is correct.

Calling strwidth or strheight on a logical vector (and NA is logical)
is correctly an error.

Brian

Subject: Exception created in RGUI.exe (PR#1748)
Message-ID: <200207052030.WAA25148@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I was trying to print out some text on an  empty PDF graph so that I would
have the statistical data in the same file as the graphs.  I was having
problems in getting the output in a PDF file, but could get it in a
postscript and BMP file.  I put together the script below to see what
'fonts' were available on PDF, is it caused an exception.

point 1 is user error: there are only fonts 1 to 5 documented anywhere
for this device.  pdf() in R-devel has been Holtman-proofed.

point 2 is also user error: the text falls on the boundary of the plot
region.  The PS device can clip partial text, whereas the PDF device
cannot.  Use xpd=TRUE if you want to plot on the edge of the region.

See the comment below.

Sorry I forgot to fix this earlier. I've replaced round with ceiling in the
development version of lattice, and will try to look out for any unexpected
problems.

Various other conditions produce the error message indicated.  Of course, not
being able to 
integrate a constant is not in itself the problem; rather, function(x)1

There is no bug.  The error message tells you that your function gives a
result of the wrong length - that means your function should give a result
with length the same as that of the input argument, x.

Try either of the following

> integrate(function(x) 1 + 0*x, 0, 1)
> integrate(function(x) rep(1, length(x)), 0, 1)

If you spot the message in these it could be the start of a seminal lesson
on vectorization.

I think people should read the documentation more carefully before sending
e-mail to R-bugs to make sure that they understand their problem correctly.
If in doubt, the problem should be reported to the R-help list.

I do not think there is anything wrong with integrate.  Here is a relevant
excerpt from the man page:

This simply means that the function has to be properly vectorized.  Your
first example - the constant function - is not.  If you replaced it with
something like

      integrate(function(x) rep(1, length(x)), 0, 1)

integrate would work properly.

Your second function works correctly since x^2 returns a vector result of
the same length as x.  The last one is really strange.  I think integrate
should return an error message in this case.

This is clearly incorrect behavior.  I included case 2 to show that some
cases
are
working correctly.

Various other conditions produce the error message indicated.  Of course,
not
being able to
integrate a constant is not in itself the problem; rather, function(x)1
generates the
same error that occurs in the real problem I'm working on.

This is user error.  The help for integrate says the first argument is
"An R function taking a numeric first argument and returning a
numeric vector the same length."  

The function has to return a vector answer when a vector argument is
given to it.

>This simply means that the function has to be properly vectorized. 

By the way, sometimes vectorizing is ugly.  Here's a simple function
that should vectorize any function that's designed to take a scalar as
the first argument.

vectorize <- function (f) 
{
  function(x,...)
  { 
     result <- rep(f(x[1],...),length(x))  # this sets type and length
     for (i in 2:length(x)) result[i] <- f(x[i],...)
     result
  }
}

It's slow, and it's ugly, but it lets the original failing example
work:

> integrate(function(x)1,0,1)
Error in integrate(function(x) 1, 0, 1) : evaluation of function gave
a result of wrong length
> integrate(vectorize(function(x)1),0,1)
1 with absolute error < 5.6e-15

This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the

Thanks much. I downloaded the source and see the problem. I misinterpreted
the manual as meaning that any function that took a single argument and
returned a single argument would be fine, when the manual and the error
message were trying to tell me that the function should simply be vectorized.
Obvious in retrospect. Sorry to have bothered you about it.
kind regards, -travis porco

thanks--i found this out when i looked at the source. i misinterpreted the
manual. since i had intended the function to take a scalar and return a
scalar, my function seemed to be correct; the intent of the manual page
was to have the user write a vectorized function, as you say, to return a
vector of function values when a vector of argument values is given to it.

Hmm:

  const gint bufsize = 2048;
  gchar buf[bufsize];

is the culprit, so a quick fix should be obvious (just use #define
instead). But is this usage of "const" variables an un-ANSI C
extension in GCC, or is it the HP C compiler that is to blame??

It's not in ANSI C89, though it is in C99.

The initialiser must be a constant expression and in C (but not C++) a
const-qualified variable doesn't qualify.

The reason I've seen for this is that the value of a const-qualfied
variable is known at link time but not necessarily at compile time.

Subject: as.character.octmode() and format.octmode() (PR#1759)
Message-ID: <200207082249.AAA04422@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Henrik Bengtsson
Version: 1.5.1
OS: WinMe
Submission from: (NULL) (217.210.0.243)


PROBLEM:

With

  x <- 0; class(x) <- "octmode"

Should 

  as.character(x)

and

  format(x)

give "" and not "0"?

SUGGESTION/SOLUTION:

Here is one fix that gives "0" instead:

as.character.octmode <- function(x, ...) {
  if (!inherits(x, "octmode"))
    stop("calling wrong method")
  isna <- is.na(x)
  y <- x[!isna]
  ans0 <- character(length(y))
  z <- NULL                          # FIX 01
  while (any(y > 0) | is.null(z)) {  # FIX 02
    z <- y%%8
    y <- floor(y/8)
    ans0 <- paste(z, ans0, sep="")
  }
  ans <- rep(as.character(NA), length(x))
  ans[!isna] <- ans0
  ans
}


Same for format.octmode().

Subject: svd() very slow for wide matrix X but not for t(X) (PR#1761)
Message-ID: <200207091540.RAA08921@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Hi All,

A colleague has just pointed out to me prcomp is *much* slower and memory
intensive when applied to very wide matrixes than when applied to the
transpose of the same matrix.  In looking for the reason, I discovered that
that the singular value decomposition function svd is the primary culprit:

On my Solaris workstation, under R 1.5.1:

	>  nr <- 50
	>  nc <- 1000
	>  x  <- matrix( rnorm( nr*nc), nrow=nr, ncol=nc )
	>  tx <- t(x)
	>
	> # SVD directly on matrix is SLOW
	>  system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 5.41 0.00 5.62 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # SVD directly on t(matrix) is FAST
	>  system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.61 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # but the results are (essentially) identical
	> max( abs(val.x) - abs(val.tx) )
	[1] 4.201361e-13

The speed difference gets worse as the number of columns grows.  

Here is a simple patch to $R_SRC/src/library/base/R/svd.R that works around
the problem.  It simply checks whether the matrix is wider than it is long,
and if so, calls itself on the transpose of the matrix, and then exchanges
the returned u and v matrixes.


*** svd.R.orig Tue Jul  9 11:06:46 2002
--- svd.R Tue Jul  9 11:06:49 2002
***************
*** 5,10 ****
--- 5,17 ----
      n <- dx[1]
      p <- dx[2]
      if(!n || !p) stop("0 extent dimensions")
+ 
+     if( p > n )  # compute on the transpose if wide
+       {
+         s <- svd( t(x), nv=nu, nu=nv)
+         return( d=s$d, u=s$v, v=s$u )
+       }
+     
      if (is.complex(x)) {
          res <- La.svd(x, nu, nv)
          return(list(d = res$d, u = if(nu) res$u, v = if(nv)
Conj(t(res$vt))))


With this patch the speed is almost the same whether called on x or tx:

	> system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 0.62 0.00 0.66 0.00 0.00

	> system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.86 0.00 0.00

	> identical( val.x, val.tx )
	[1] TRUE

This is fine for my purposes, but perhaps someone familiar with the FORTRAN
code should see why its performance is so unbalanced.

This may be of interest:

http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/

It looks like this version may well be more complete and conform the standards than the version that comes with R.

BTW: I am currently patching unix/sys_std.c and modules/gtkconsole.c such that they don't store lines in the history that are identical to the previous line. Is there any interest in posting those patches here?

Peter (and others):

AFAIK, gcc is the only C compiler that allows this sort of fortran-like syntax. Mighty handy, but not portable at all. However, behind the screens, it translates this (more or less) into a call to alloca(). This is a function that is part of most modern systems, and of which portable versions can be found (outside the glibc source tree). BTW: debugging code that allocates arrays like this is not trivial, as on all systems I've seen, you cannot directly access element n as array[n] (from within gdb, that is).

There is a comprehensive whitepaper about gcc's not-portable-outside-gcc quirks available on Metrowerk's site, called Porting GNU C Programs to Metrowerks' CodeWarrior C Compiler.

Variable-length arrays aren't that unpopular an extension.  They are in
the Sun Workshop compiler, for example.

However in this case there *isn't* a variable-length array, it's just a
fixed length array declared by someone who didn't realise that a const
variable isn't a constant expression.

Or, using the canonical scheme for regional CRAN mirrors:

http://cran.au.r-project.org

which seems to work fine (and of course it is identical to
cran.planetmirror.com).

If the diff are relatively small and look good, the chances are
relatively high the inc. will happen.

I think this is a very useful idea -- though I probably will
almost never make use of it, using ESS 99.5% of the time.

There is a bug in all.equal.character:

It appears that there is a typo in all.equal.character. "out" is never created.

> all.equal.character

    lt <- length(target)
    lc <- length(current)
    if (lt != lc) {
        msg <- paste("Lengths (", lt, ", ", lc, ") differ (string compare on first ", 
            ll <- min(lt, lc), ")", sep = "")
        ll <- seq(length = ll)
        target <- target[ll]
        current <- current[ll]
    }
    else msg <- NULL
    nas <- is.na(target)
    if (any(nas != is.na(current))) 
        return(paste("`is.NA' value mismatches:", sum(is.na(current)), 
            "in current,", sum(out), " in target"))

Perhaps "sum(out)" should be "sum(is.na(target))"? That change would lead to:

> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))
[1] "`is.NA' value mismatches: 1 in current, 0  in target"

  The version included in R has been "grafted" from a project called 'wget', 
as far as I have read the comments in vsnprintf.c . Those same comments also 
mention a list of issues, that may have been solved, but maybe not -- I 
haven't tried. It is quite possible that it works well enough as far as R is 
concerned. The version on the link I sent works well too (I use it under 
Irix), and according to its website, it complies to all standards that 
apply. And it *is* free: one can choose between the Artistic License and the 
GPL.

>only if they might be incorporated in to a future version of R  :--)

  My intention is indeed they *be* incorporated in a future version -- that 
would save me from having to apply the same patch each time R bumps a 
version digit >8-
It sure looks the diffs are going to be small, since (fortunately) adding to 
the history is done in a single place. The terminal version works, the gtk 
version still needs some polishing that I hope to finish today.
What do you mean with looking good?

You'll see just how useful when you do have to step down to the terminal or 
gtk based version :)

Here's the patch. It looks like it does what I want it to do, but I haven't 
yet tried it with multiple-line entries and the like. Please let me know if 
anything turns up that I should look into (I attached it too, in case 
hotmail wraps).

yes.  Definitely a bug introduced by cut&paste (from *.numeric).
It will be fixed in R-patched and R-devel by this night.

Subject: bug(?) in R FAQ - Should I run R from within Emacs? (PR#1772)
Message-ID: <200207110822.KAA17398@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I have a small request re.

R FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions on R
Version 1.5-10, 2002-06-13
ISBN 3-901167-51-X
Kurt Hornik


In section 6.2 Should I run R from within Emacs? The faq says

"Yes, definitely." 

This led me to install emacs, and to install ess. However, I use a windows
environment (mswindows2000) and I had some difficulty installing, linking
and launching these applications. After several hours I had launched emacs
but had failed to link it with either ess or r, partly because of platform
problems. (As a dedicated windows user, I am reluctant to tinker with
autoexec.bat and the like).

I spent several hours doing this, and in hindsight, I decided to uninstall
emacs and ess.
 
I would prefer if the faq could be changed to say:

"This is optional."

And perhaps some comment could be made about platforms. I found the
documentation for emacs and ess to be a bit of a hair-pulling exercise. NOT
one of the "plug and play" applications that MS windows is so fond of! 

By the way, I like the r gui very much. I used splus for some time as a PhD
student, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that my scripts run in r!! I
intend to use r from now onwards, and to encourage my colleagues to use it
too.

Kind regards,

For the cost of one of those plug and play apps that your OS is so
fond of, I'd be happy to provide a simple install.  Would you like to
know where to send your check to?  

(In fact, for XEmacs, we have).

Sure, no problem.  The one I choose is... R!  It's got a simple
install.  Where do you want the check for R's license fee sent?

>(In fact, for XEmacs, we have).

Thanks!  You guys are fast!

So, use the XEmacs InstallShield installer.

Once it's installed, use the tools->packages facility to add ESS.
Use the options->edit init file, add "(require 'ess-site)" (w/o
quotes). 

It works with R. 

Not tested with other tools (i.e. I did nearly exactly this on MacOS
X)

best,
-tony

As far as I can see, you never actually link against the tcl/tk
libraries (-ltcl -ltk) so you'd need more stuff in TCLTK_LIBS. Or
maybe simply *not* set it and let configure work it out.

Subject: Minor bug in dlnorm (PR#1781)
Message-ID: <200207121943.VAA26420@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The density of a lognormal should be 0 for negative arguments, but

> dlnorm(-1)
[1] NaN
Warning message: 
NaNs produced in: dlnorm(x, meanlog, sdlog, log) 

A simple fix is to change dlnorm's definition to:

function (x, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1, log = FALSE) 
.Internal(dlnorm(x*(x>0), meanlog, sdlog, log))

It might be faster to put the same sort of adjustment into the
internal code, but I couldn't spot where that lives.

In src/nmath/dlnorm.c.  I fixed it there.

Maybe, but what is in R does what R requires, and has been thoroughly
tested.  I don't propose to do the work again!

8-) Maybe, but what is in R does what R requires, and has been thoroughly
8-) tested.  I don't propose to do the work again!

This is of course entirely up to the judgement of the R-Core members. I can't begin to oversee what subtle formatting documented and undocumented commands R uses, nor how much work it will be to test another version for compliance with R's needs. I have tested only the standard behaviour of the version referenced above, which works, well, standardly, and compilation and using the library was a breeze (on Irix 6.2; there is a thorough test included).
It should be kept in mind however that on most systems where R runs, snprintf c.s. are available, likely in uptodate versions that conform to all or most of the approbriate standards. In other words, they evolve, as R's use of them may, and as the included version will most probably not. This was my main reason to point out the existence of an independent snprintf library that looks like it is being maintained, not some idea R's included version is not up to the task!

I was trying to get the package yags 3.20 by Vince Carey

the

Those were the facts. R FAQ: Bugs warns against trying to provide an 
explanation for what happens.  However, I was unable to resist trying 
to figure out what was wrong.

There was a duplicated slot name in the yags source code the triggered
this "stop" function, but apparently the 'sep = ""' argument has slipped
out of the parentheses following the 'paste' function and is now an argument
to the 'stop' function instead, which generates the 'unused argument(s)' 
error. This occurs in the function 'representation' in the file 
SClasses.R in the methods directory of the R source. The same typo
occurs in the same function a few lines above it. The following diff
indicates at which lines these 'stop' functions occur:

tykki:~/R-1.5.1/src/library/methods/R# diff  SClasses.R.old SClasses.R
33c33
<         stop(paste("Duplicate class names among superclasses:",
paste(includes[duplicated(includes)], collapse = ", ")), sep="")
---
>         stop(paste("Duplicate class names among superclasses:",
paste(includes[duplicated(includes)], collapse = ", "), sep=""))
36c36
<        stop(paste("Duplicated slot names: ", paste(slots[duplicated(slots)],
collapse="")), sep="")
---
>        stop(paste("Duplicated slot names: ", paste(slots[duplicated(slots)],
collapse=""), sep=""))
---
I am no sure if the 'sep = ""' argument is intended for the first or the
second of the 'paste' functions.


I have separately notified the author of yags about the problem there.

Hello

I had a problem in reading in an EPS file from R into Star Office 5.2 - although
it 
works for several other word processors. The online support at Sun helped me
with the following reply, indicating that the export of EPS from R was faulty.

You might like to update this, at least it would be helpful for Linux/Star
Office users.

Regards

KP

Reply from SUN SUPPORT ->

Hi Kenneth, 
Loading problems with EPS files can appear if in the file format header the file
format information is missing (so-called "Magic"). This can be caused by the
program which exported the EPS file. In this case, please inform the
manufacturer of the program which causes the faulty EPS export. In the TGIF
created EPS files, the first line reads: 

%! 

StarOffice expects however: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0 

If you manually modify the line, StarOffice can read this file without a
problem. 

Hope this helps, 

Sanal

What did you do to make an EPS file?  This would appear to be user error,
not a bug, as R does create the right header when producing EPS files.


Following ?postscript (or using dev.copy2eps) gives

postscript(file="test.eps", width = 4.0, height = 3.0,
           horizontal = FALSE, onefile = FALSE)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

gannet% head test.eps
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Helvetica
...

And if you omit onefile=FALSE, you get

%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Helvetica
...

and *never* %!

(That is probably not easily possible: take a look at the code to see
why: key presses are encoded in 8 bits by Guido's code.)

The outer call.

Thanks.

It might be nice to have stop() take multiple arguments in the same
style as warning() to save  typographical errors for those of us with
parenthesis-dislexia.  Looks like the same one-line addition,
      if(nargs() == 0) message <- NULL else message <- paste(...,
sep="")
would work in stop().

That discrepancy between warning() and stop() has always puzzled me.
I've just altered stop() to allow multiple arguments.

Subject: R crashes when using "xyplot" (PR#1801)
Message-ID: <200207171342.PAA14387@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Carsten Dormann
Version: 1.4.0

Submission from: (NULL) (192.171.129.9)


Hello,

using the function xyplot I repeatedly had R crashing.

One example is from the book of Mick Crawley (Stat. Computing in Splus), where
the commandline reads: xyplot(Weight~Age|Genotype, pch=16)
I also had the same phenomenon with my own data and commands even simpler.

I reinstalled lattice, because on loading the package I got an error message
that the lattice.dll couldn't be found. However that wasn't the cause of the
problem. I downloaded the package again from a different mirror site, all in
vain.
This is the simplest code I could create to crash R with xyplot:
> x_runif(100)
> y_rnorm(100)
> plot(x,y)
> xyplot(y~x)
CRASH!

Best wishes,

Carsten

Try the current version of R: yours is long obselete and I suspect has a
mismatched version of grid.  The current version comes with grid/lattice.

Please read what a bug is and how to report a bug.
With recent versions of R (R-1.4.0 is not recent!), lattice and grid I
cannot reproduce the crash.

Uwe Ligges

BTW: 
- For good reasons, "_" will be depreciated shortly, AFAIK.
- I'd suggest to avoid random numbers for code in bug reports.

Not unless set.seed() is called, I suppose?

Not unless set.seed() is called, I suppose?

Message-ID: <20020717145603.I1785@yukon.drivingbeat.com>

hi,

I'm a bit new to R and need a hand importing some data.
I have a data set with jut x,y pairs in it:

x1,y1
x2,y2
x3,y3

I can read it in fine, but I would like to do some cluster analysis on it.
So I'll need to get it the proper data structure. Any ideas?

Thanks,
j.

Subject: Fault in anova.glm (PR#1807)
Message-ID: <200207180650.IAA16820@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When anova.glm is given several models to compare it ignores any prescribed
dispersion parameter.

An example:


> library (MASS)
> cond1 <- c(20, 50, 3, 9, 15, 20) 	
> cond2 <- c(18, 32, 44, 180, 25, 17) 	
> cond3 <- c(4, 11, 12, 44, 15, 6) 	
> testData <- data.frame(res = c(cond1, cond2, cond3),
+        conditions = factor(rep(1:3, c(6,6,6)))) 
> fm <- glm( res ~ conditions, family = negative.binomial(theta = 1),
testData)
> fm0 <- update(fm, .~1)
> anova(fm0, fm, test="Chisq", dispersion = 1)
Analysis of Deviance Table

Model 1: res ~ 1
Model 2: res ~ conditions
  Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance P(>|Chi|)
1        17    16.8979                      
2        15    11.6307  2   5.2672    0.0668

On the other hand:

> 1 - pchisq(5.2672, 2)
[1] 0.07181945
> 

The fix:

Replace line 16 of anova.glm:

        return(anova.glmlist(c(list(object), dotargs), test = test))

by

	return(anova.glmlist(c(list(object), dotargs), 
		dispersion = dispersion, test = test))

eof-----

I have an array of skip values, and the number of lines to read after the skip
values:

skip.lines<-4  #number of lines between task headers
skip.1<-2      #number of lines to the first task header
n.tasks<-10     #number of tasks in the file
n.lines<-1     #number of lines per task (excluding header)

tmp<-seq(1,n.tasks)
skip<- skip.1 + skip.lines * (tmp -1)

# and the read.table is in a loop:

for (i in 1:n.tasks) {
    i.dat<-read.table("tmp.txt",  sep=",", strip.white=TRUE, fill=TRUE,
skip=skip[i], nrows=n.lines, header=FALSE)
    i.name<-substr(names(i.dat)[7],1,4)

    more stuff here
}

When only the first block (first 5 rows) of the file are used, there is no
problem.  When the subsequent blocks are included, R appears to be looking for
more "fields" in the rows 3 and 4 than actually exist.  Changing to header=FALSE
allows me to see all the data, but then I have to transform from character to
numeric and I don't get the names in the data frame.

This script works if the data file has more than one row of data below the
header. (Just cut and paste a data row)

Regards,

michael.

Subject: R-devel Mac OSX build wierdness...
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10207190041300.26875-100000@hsph.harvard.edu>

I encountered some wierdness when building R-devel (latest rsync) on OSX
using commandline tools (as opposed to the Carbon GUI and
whatnot...probably just laziness on my part but it generally works :-)).

At any rate, sometime between 2002-07-05 and the present the configure
scripts started setting INSTALL_DATA to ${R_HOME}/bin/install -c in
Makeconf...which causes wierdness for the Mac OSX (10.1.5) version of sh
(which is actually zsh I believe) as it tries to use INSTALL and make
simply fails. Of course, even with a sensible shell this should fail as
${R_HOME}/bin/install doesn't exist. Changing this to '/usr/bin/install
-c' allowed the build to proceed normally.

I solved this problem by using explicit paths to the libraries in the 
compilation (I think this was the important change).

You can close this bug.

Thanks for the help, Jeremy

Hard to believe.  The Autoconf code has

[AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_INSTALL])
case "${INSTALL}" in
  [[\\/]]* | ?:[[\\/]]* ) # absolute
    ;;
  *)
    INSTALL="\$\(top_srcdir\)/tools/install-sh -c"
    ;;
esac
])# R_PROG_INSTALL

so either you end up with something absolute or the string in the
default clause.

I assume this is a combination of you putting R_HOME/bin in your PATH
and MacOSX being case-insensitive in some cases?

The problem appears to be with as.POSIXct on the Mac.  Operations that
don't coerce to POSIXct work, those that do, don't.

I think I've found why.

The epoch date on the Mac is 1904-1-1 not 1970-1-1.

This has two effects. First, everything's off by 66 years. Second, it's
important to treat the time as unsigned long, not long, since it's already
greater than 2^31 some time in 1997.

Aren't standards wonderful?

Subject: bug in R-1.5.1 for Mac OS X installer (PR#1825)
Message-ID: <200207222341.BAA05215@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi,

Thanks for developing an outstanding software for free. I admire all your 
effort greatly. I would like to submit a bug report on the R-1.5.1 
installer (in .mpkg, .pkg format) for Mac OS X.

I'm using fink in conjunction with Darwin. In my environment, /usr/local is 
symbolically linked to /sw which is fink's main directory. This is to 
conform the directory structure on my machine to the standard UNIX/Linux 
one.

It turned out that R-1.5.1 installer ignores the symbolic link and creates 
new /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib directories on their own, thereby 
installing all its stuff into them. This is really annoying. (Actually, 
after installing R, bash stopped running. At first, I couldn't figure out 
at all what happened. It turned out that bash failed to runs because it 
lost access dynamic libraries in /usr/local/lib directory.)

I hope the installer properly follows symbolic links during installation.

Cheers,
Kow

Hello

Thanks for the report. Do you have

/usr/local->/sw

or

/sw->/usr/local

i.e. which one of the two only exists as a soft link ? Probably /sw,  
i.e.
fink really installs in /usr/local.

It is generally bad to confound /sw and /usr/local, see

http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/general.php#usr-local

The R installer tries to install in /sw (fink stuff) and in /usr/local
(R stuff). It must get confused when it is trying to locate /sw/lib,
deciding this does not exist, then creating it as /usr/local/lib.
Same for /sw/bin. I don't think there is much I can do about it,
it's what the Installer does. I can warn people.

By the way, where was your bash executable ? This was not
overwritten ?

gsub() return different answers depending on how the input
variables were created. Here is an example of code that
replicates the problem. The vectors y and yy appear to be
the same, but gsub() doesn't return the same answer.
It should remove all the blanks when I use the vector y,
but it doesn't remove them all. I have also tested that
the same problem occurs if sub() is used instead of gsub().

x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",
     .Label = c("1 ", "2 ", "3 ", "4 ", "5 "))
y <- as.character(x)
y
gsub(" ","",y)

yy <- c("1 ","3 ","4 ","5 ")
yy
gsub(" ","",yy)


Below is the output that I have when I execute those commands.

Those are not blanks!  You have character <A0> in there. less on your
email gives me

> x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",
+      .Label = c("1 ", "2 ", "3 ", "4<A0>", "5<A0>"))

[1] "1 " "3 " "4<A0>" "5<A0>"
> gsub(" ","",y)
[1] "1"  "3"  "4<A0>" "5<A0>"

which is correct.

Pilot error, I believe ....

I can't reproduce this (1.5.1, Debian Linux). I get

[1] TRUE

There used to be a possible bug where the R length and C length of a
string would be different (PR#1724), which might cause that sort of thing,
but the known manifestations of it were removed in 1.5.1

Yes. I immediately noticed it when I viewed my bug report on the 
internet. Those characters appeared blank on my screen before I 
submitted the bug report. I tried to submit a change for this bug, but 
perhaps I don't have the privilege to do so. Sorry about this...

Dear Michael Camann,

My concern was after having a hetero-computing environment for many years, I
found that I had to keep an old version of Microsoft Windows based
applications to be able to interact with my constituents. This at times can
become very expensive. I have had to limit my budget on the UNIX/Linux
platform to compensate for Microsoft Windows based applications.

With Open Office 1.0.1 this is a move in a positive direction. Currently, I
am Sun Microsystems Certified, of which, Sun Microsystems is one of the
contributors to the Open Office 1.0.1 multi-platform application. I am also,
Microsoft Windows Certified along with experience on the HP-UX, IBM AIX,
OS/2, Open Software Foundation, Silicon Graphics, Digital VMS/UNIX (HP),
True 64, Novell, Banyan Vines, BSD, Macintosh and a few others at or above
the level of Certification. But, the problem exists with having to pay for
each platform's certification. As you can see, I am not just limited to two
platforms.

I will just take a step back and let you know that I have been involved with
multi-platform systems for over twenty years, so, I have seen a improvement
over the years. The key factors here are "Cost, Efficiency, Development,
Production and Usability of Fully Functioning Applications!" We need to be
able to get things done and they cannot all be done under a mono-platform.
That is why we have stereo or hetero-computing environments.

We must be able to communicate in stereo and do it on a positive plain. Just
like, 3D or 4D.

I am honored you took time out of your busy scheduled to respond to my
e-mail. It goes to show, we all have a role in life and though it may seem
simplistic by design, on a difference plain it is important. Many thanks,
Michael Camann.

Shawn--

Thought I'd reply simply because I've recently had a similar experience
and thought you might be interested in a slightly different perspective.
I've been running a hetero-computing environment for several years, with
some machines that were dual-boot Linux/MSWindows and others that were
pure Linux but with the Win4Lin kernal installed so that Win98 ran in an
X11 window.  That worked pretty well-- all the usual MSWindows office
software ran (and was stable!) as well as a few vector graphics and data
analysis programs that don't have Linux counterparts.

A couple of recent events on my only 100% Windows computer pissed me off
so badly that I've mostly migrated AWAY for the hetero environment toward
a pure Linux environment.  You're right, OpenOffice was key to being able
to achieve this-- the last StarOffice version (5.2 as I recall) just
wasn't up to the full compatibility task, but SO 6.0 (upon which the OO
code is based) is so far performing just fine.  I do have one computer in
the lab-- a laptop-- that's still dual boot AND has the Win4Lin kernel
just for a few remaining programs that I haven't found replacements for
under Linux, but that number is declining almost daily.  I'm almost ready
to completely migrate to a homogenous Linux environment.  I think I'll
break my Win2K CD's and send them back to Microsoft-- an empty gesture,
but if enough people do it they'll have to get the message....

Best,
Mike C.

Hi,

I asked some days ago how to guess the o.s. the machine is running. I
found that it is stored in a variable called  R_PLATFORM. Now I need a
full list of  all the values this variable can have because I need to set
an option  depending on the endianness of the platform in which we are

 Anyone can help me? Thanks,

I don't think a complete list exists.  I'd suggest running R to find
out:  Platform()$endian gives the result you need, so something like
this works in Windows:

 echo cat(Platform()$endian) | Rterm --slave

R_PLATFORM is used set in etc/Renviron.  You can't find a complete
list, as R can be compiled on new platforms.  In any case, a user could
change the value.

The information you want is in the Rconfig.h header file, in
/* #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
which is uncommented on big-endian systems.

This *is* documented in `Writing R Extensions'.  From R code, look at
.Platform$endian.

Platform() is to be deprecated in the next release: please use

The line

looks like it has problems for p near 1.  I would suggest rewriting it to

I don't think that helps for p near 1. It might do so for p near 0,
though. (The whole thing is a bit esoteric since it only becomes
relevant when you want the upper tail and on a log scale.)

Please report the bug (see BUGS in the FAQ) and not the solution.  It
seems to me to be working fine for p as small as 10^(-8) which is already
way beyond a feasible application of a geometric (as an exponential would
be used instead).

Uwe,

The titles are not necessarily intended to be aliases.  units.Rd is
another one.  Once upon a time \title automatically generated a \alias,
but not for some time (and I've forgotten the reasoning).

I think this is confusing, as help.search shows the entry as Random(base)
but ?Random does not work.  On the other hand, ?Binomial does work, and
there is no object Binomial.  My preference would be to change
help.search, I think.

In any case, this is not an isolated instance.

Brian

Subject: R 1.5.1 (Windows) crashes on plotting density(rnorm(1000)) (PR#1837)
Message-ID: <200207261416.QAA24871@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I am experiencing a reproducible crash from the following statement:

plot(density(rnorm(1000)))

on R 1.5.1 on Windows 2000.

This is a dual-processor machine with 512Mb of RAM.  Please advise if 
further details of hardware/OS are needed.

If rgui.exe is in use, the crash occurs before the plot can be 
displayed.  If rterm.exe is in use, the plot appears, then the error (and 
crash).

A screen capture of the error dialog box  can be viewed/downloaded at

http://shrimp.ccfhrb.noaa.gov/~mprager/rcrash.png

I happen to have Compaq Fortran installed, and therefore a debugger appears 
after the crash.  As I know nothing about systems programming, the debugger 
information (assembler) is meaningless to me, but if it would be useful, I 
can reproduce the crash, save the debugger information, and send it along.

This seems similar to crashes experienced in S-Plus that have been 
attributed to that program's assuming certain behavior on illegal math 
operations, behavior reportedly reset by HP printer drivers.  I do have an 
HP printer installed (hardly avoidable in the PC world).  But that 
observation may be totally irrelevant.

Thanks!

   will we know that we have solved them?

Visual inspection.  The problem is that the original code performs an
operation, "1-p", with the potential of killing all precision.  Often
that cannot be helped, but here the function log1p exists as a counterpart
to log in order to solve this very problem.

   >     return log1p (-p) * (x + 1);

   Please report the bug (see BUGS in the FAQ) and not the solution.  It
   seems to me to be working fine for p as small as 10^(-8) which is already
   way beyond a feasible application of a geometric (as an exponential would
   be used instead).

It is entirely likely that such values are unreasonable, but that is still
not a great reason for returning terrible results for something that is at
least theoretically sane.  The actual point where problems occur is going
to depend on your floating point hardware.  For me, p=1e-17 makes the old
version return zero (fundamentally wrong) and the new version non-zero.

Note, that variations of "log (1-p)" exist in other functions, such as
pbeta_raw.

But for p near 1 (you give near 0 below) the distribution is concentrated
almost entirely on a single point.

That's nowhere near one!

I think this amounts to

`if I were to do really silly things numerical inaccuracies might catch up
with me'.

That's true throughout R, but we do have better things to worry about.

How can a random result be reproducible?  You could have told us the seed
in use!   I've tried this ten times without a crash, on two separate
machines, one XP and one 2000.

There is advice on how to do this in a usable way in the rw-FAQ.

R is already well-protected against that HP bug (which does not occur on
WIndows 2000 BTW, and was discovered by me under Win98), and I do have an
HP printer installed.

I just tried it in a single processor WinXP machine, with no error.
It's conceivable that the value of the random seed has an effect, but
it's more likely something else.

The invalid operation error can definitely be triggered by code that
messes with the floating point control word.  I hadn't heard that
printer drivers do this, but it is common in video drivers.  Could you
check that you have the latest video driver (and printer driver)
installed?

I don't know an easy way to diagnose this error remotely.

Not \title, but \name.  This is how we started out.  We then realized
that e.g. we cannot have .Script.Rd so now we separate the name of the
documentation object from the topics it provides documentation for.

I do not see what is confusing.  Rd writers create a help file and use
\alias to register the topics documented.  We cannot assume that the
file name is a topic documented, see zScript.Rd which documents .Script.

Why should 'Random' be a topic documented?

help.start() has a bug because it incorrectly assumes that we can get
help on the name.  I will fix this by instead pointing to the *first*
alias in the documentation object.

Subject: predict() still not yet "safe".. (PR#1840)
Message-ID: <200207261812.UAA25583@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Executive Summary: This only concerns  predict() at new points
	  when the formula contained things like poly() or ns() {in the RHS}.

Because I hadn't have time to fix this yet, I submit it.
[R version 1.5.1 and at least 1.4.1, probably all versions at all:]
For these, R 1.5.x does not differ from 1.4.1 : Inspite of R
1.5.0's "NEWS" entry and the ?Safepredict help page, 
predict() doesn't (always?) work correctly for (some cases of)
   predict(lm(y ~  poly(....)), newdata = .....)
or
   predict(lm(y ~  ns(....)),   newdata = .....)

Here is a simple (longer than necessary) example 

#### This modified from the last part of  example(cars) {of R 1.5.1}:

data(cars)
## An example of polynomial regression
## -- to show the bug, the linear example is sufficient
cars.1 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 1), data = cars)
cars1  <- lm(dist ~      speed,              data = cars)# the `same'
all.equal(predict(cars.1), predict(cars1))# the fitted values are ok

cars.4 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 4), data = cars)
newd <- data.frame(speed = d <- seq(0, 25, length = 51)) # shorter than in ?cars
pr1d <- predict(cars.1, newd)
pr4d <- predict(cars.4, newd)

plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))
abline(cars1, col = "blue")# the correct one
## in R 1.5.0 and 1.5.1, these look wrong (particularly to the left!):
lines(d, pr1d)
lines(d, pr4d, col = "red")

## or see by simple prediction at one point
predict(cars1,  data.frame(speed = 4)) # -1.84946
predict(cars.1, data.frame(speed = 4))
## --> Error in poly(speed, degree = 1) :
##          degree must be less than number of points

Right.

 
> I do not see what is confusing. 

Well, Random is listed at several places, e.g. in the result of
 help.search("random")  : # ..., Random(base), ...
So, at least for me, it is confusing trying ?Random after that.

Agreed, but why not \name ?

As Martin pointed out, not only help.start() has this "bug"(?).

I think it is not a bad idea to get help with ?NAME , if NAME is listed
anywhere else ...

I think Kurt is already allowing that as confusing.

We need \name to hyperlink correctly. This came about originally because
of Windows file name restrictions, and later Kurt's example came up on
some MacOS variant.

Agreed, but my solution was to not use NAME anywhere else.  I don't have a
problem with the Java search, as clicking on the item works.

There is a side issue. Is `Random' a reasonable help topic?  Probably not
(ditto Binomial) but `random' probably is.

Subject: diagonals of tensors
Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.44.0207261153230.62952-100000@homer30.u.washington.edu>



 Is there a simple and efficient way of extract `diagonals' from arrays
(tensors)

That is, suppose  A is a 20x10x2 array, B is 10x5 and C is 20x5 I would
like the 2x5 matrix whose i,j entry is

      sum_k sum_l  A(k,l,i)B(l,j)C(k,j)


Using tensor() (or outer and matrix multiplication) it's easy to construct
the 2x5x5 matrix with i,j,J entry

       sum_k sum_l  A(k,l,i)B(l,j)C(k,J)

[eg tensor(tensor(A,B,2,1),C,1,1) ]
and I'm looking for the j==J `diagonal', ideally without constructing the
whole thing.

I've met similar problems, independently.
The bug tracking list does not tell that is already done.

I've attached a patch file and the modified read.table.R.
Hope it helps. However, it is not intensively tested.

Subject: printed copies of "An Introduction to R"
Message-ID: <m17YWmw-0000eAC@localhost>

Hi, 

I'd like to ask the R developers if it would be ok to post a
message on R-announce about the availability of printed
copies of "An Introduction to R", which I have published.

For details see, http://www.network-theory.co.uk/R/manual/

Any money raised will be used to support free software
development -- if there is a way to make donations directly
to the R project please let me know.

regards,

Brian Gough

p.s. If any of the core developers would like a copy please
contact me privately.

[Forwarded to r-bugs, since the docs say that f can be a list in all
the split-related functions]

Thanks for pointing this out. I think your code should work, although
I'm slightly uneasy about actually modifying f, so how about

        len <- length(if (is.list(f)) f[[1]] else f)
        x <- vector(mode = typeof(value[[1]]), length = len)

?

By the way, I see that split.default starts with 

    if (is.list(f)) 
        f <- factor(do.call("interaction", f))

What is the reason (if any) why this cannot just be f <-
interaction(f) ? If there is one, then it is likely that you would
have to do the same in unsplit.

Calling with separate factors is what is actually documented for
interaction.  The code for interaction shows that passing the arguments as
a list also works, and has since Dec 98.  I'll alter interaction.Rd.

Just curious, why are you uneasy about that? Does it have side effects?

The reason I used the interaction() call is that this seems to work too:

 > split(1:10,list(a=1:2,b=1:5))

So, lists with unequal lengths.

It is largely due superstition, but if you change f before calling
split<-() you have split() and split<-() called with different f's
even if the same f is used for split() and unsplit(). That can be
quite OK, but there's a marginal risk that it causes an inconsistency
somewhere so that the split and unsplit aren't exact inverses.

OK, I understand. Thanks for explaining.

You're right, it doesn't work. I was a bit blinded by the fact that

split(1:10,list(a=1:2,b=1:2))

did what I expected, although I now understand that I should not rely on 
these results. Should have payed more attention to the help pages and 
the warnings.

Subject: R Code for X-Tab with Row/Col Proportions, Expected Vals and Tests
Message-ID: <006601c23685$b499e510$0201a8c0@MARC>


Recently, I noted a post and replies on R-Help from Professor Marc
Feldesman regarding a cross tabulation function that generates row and
column proportions, marginal values, expected cell values and tests for
independence presumably similar in a fashion to the output of the S-Plus
crosstabs() function or SAS Proc Freq.

Martin Maechler had posted some code in reply for folks to update and
translate.  

In parallel, out of my own needs for something functionally similar, I
have been working for a while on a function that takes either a
two-dimensional matrix or two vectors and generates just such a table,
with output similar to the aforementioned S-Plus/SAS functions.  Column
widths are adjusted based upon the dimnames and the digits argument and
the printed table is labeled with vector names if used.

The code for the function is below.  If anyone wishes me to e-mail a
text file containing the code, let me know.

My goal would be to make this available to the R community as open
source, either independently or perhaps if deemed appropriate, as a base
function.

I would appreciate any constructive criticism of the code itself or the
output. My guess is that there may be more efficient means of performing
some of the manipulations and/or perhaps being consistent with core R
coding and output standards.

If there are any suggestions for improvement, I would be more than happy
to incorporate these and make them available to the community.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to any feedback.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: quantile()  bug (PR#1852)

language R

The function quantile, in base, sometimes gives incorrect results
and is unnecessarily complicated.  For example,

> x <- c(-Inf, -Inf, Inf, Inf)
> quantile(x)
  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
-Inf -Inf -Inf  Inf  Inf

The correct result is
 0%  25%  50%  75%  100%
-Inf -Inf    NaN    Inf     Inf

Here the calculation at probs = 0.5 is
    50% quantile = x[2] + 0.5 * (x[3] - x[2])
                       = -Inf + 0.5 * (Inf - (-Inf))
                       = -Inf + Inf
                       = NaN

The responsible code is:

n <- length(x)
np <- length(probs)
if(n > 0 && np > 0) {
index <- 1 + (n - 1) * probs
lo <- floor(index)
hi <- ceiling(index)
x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))
i <- index > lo
qs <- x[lo]
    i <- seq(along=i)[i & !is.na(i)][qs[i] > -Inf]
    .minus <- function(x,y) ifelse(x == y, 0, x - y)# ok for Inf - Inf
    qs[i] <- qs[i] + .minus(x[hi[i]], x[lo[i]]) * (index[i] - lo[i])
}

I suggest:

n <- length(x)
np <- length(probs)
If(n > 0 && np > 0){
    index <- 1 + (n - 1) * probs
    lo <- pmin(floor(index), n - 1)
    hi <- lo + 1
    x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))
    qs <- x[lo]
    dif <- ifelse(x[hi] != qs, x[hi] - qs, 0) # Avoid Inf-Inf NaN.
    qs <- ifelse((fac <- location - k) != 0, qs + fac * dif, qs)
}

Subject: Optim() returns wrong maximum
Message-ID: <3D466034.ED2C7EFF@lancs.ac.uk>

Dear R-devel

During the last half a year I have several times encountered the
following problem with optim() when using method= "L-BFGS-B". 

The function return a value which is clearly not the maximum (seen from
printing the value each time the function is called). Some output is
shown below.

A few things I have observed (as I remember it):

a. The problem seems to occur when the last function call is for a value
on the boundary.

b. The problem also seems to occur more frequently in cases where the
function providing the gradient is mis-specified.


I have deliberately not provided code such that you can reproduce the
behaviour. The reason being that these functions are complicated  and
involves a lot of input (data, fixed parameters, etc).


Someone might spot the problem based on the information I have given
(possibly a bug in optim() ?).
In case not, I would like to ask if anyone has observed similar problems
?. 
This may help me to construct a more simple example, which I could then
submit with reproducible code.

Here ``likeli.time.log'' and ``gradient.time.log'' are functions,

Note that value returned is clearly not the maximum, but optim() reports

Hi Ole,

I have encountered similar problems.
Even more, the parameters are not always 
within the given bounds (for method= "L-BFGS-B")
The values are then only an epsilon outside,
but it can be very disturbing nonetheless.

Cheers,
Martin

PS: the MLE algorithm in my contributed package 
    `RandomFields' is written such that it
    gets around with these two problems of optim

Hello,

 I think the best option isd the one proposed by Mr. Ripley. We have added
some C and the package compiles fine on Sun machines, and it should do
on other Big Endian machines.

solved :
before installing using menu option, go to "program files\R\rw1051\library" and
make a directory "pubbias", then install the package from the local zip file
option.

Thanks,

There is nothing here that we could reproduce.

The option does work: download any of the zip files on CRAN and try it.
(Indeed, the same code is used by the option to install from CRAN, and we
have had no reports of problems.)

Two possible issues spring to mind:

1) the zip file might have invalid internal structure.  Maybe it is
missing the directory `pubbias' (although the unzip code should cope with
that, and that's not the error code I would expect).

2) This is not the first attempt to do something like this, and Windows
had the location in use.  (I have seen that one, and after a reboot it
worked cleanly.)

BTW, the version currently on CRAN is dated late on June 18, and *that
one* seems to have the problem, whereas the one I have which was
downloaded earlier that day (and has a June 17 date) does not.

Subject: Assignment operators (was [R] modifying a vector)
Message-ID: <A8877251964B294BAB5BA1FC58B43FED26DCCE@molly.tas.csiro.au>

Bill Venables expected howls of protest about deprecation of underscore for
assign. Here's my one-and-only howl on this point:

(1) I don't like <- as an assignment operator, because it creates an
ambiguity with comparisons: I can write "x+1", "x-1", "x<1" but not "x<-1".
However, I guess it's a bit much to expect the entire R/S community to do
away with "<-" in favour of "_" or Delphi (Pascal) notation ":=", much as it
would delight me; so we're stuck with <- I guess.

(2) "_" strikes me as completely unambiguous. It means assignment, and
that's all it means. For my money, that's more important than aesthetics.
Anyway, if you choose a nice colourscheme, the _ doesn't look that bad. Me,
I like green.

(3) for my remaining bit of money, "=" should not be allowed at all as an
assignment operator: S made a mistake but R doesn't have to.
"="-as-assignment has to be hedged with all sorts of conditions to prevent
ambiguities, and to have an operator which frequently can't be used doesn't
seem helpful. Having it "grudgingly available to the cognoscenti" is not all
that much better!

(4) If deprecation is the first step on the road to removal and to "_" being
allowed in unquoted variable names, then that would be tiresome. I have many
hundreds of functions spanning thousands of lines of S/R code, filled with
"_"s. I really don't want to spend time changing all of them just to solve a
non-problem in R. Which is, I should emphasize, a wonderful piece of
software.

Summary: to lose "_" and gain "=" would be a double whammy with added salt
in the wound.

Subject: SetGeneric and formula interfaces
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0207011205510.12824-100000@artemis>


Hi, 

while playing with the `methods' package I was not able to find what the
recommended way of dealing with the following problem is.

Suppose there is a generic function `foo' and two functions `foo.default'
and `foo.formula', in the classical way:

foo <- function(y, ...) UseMethod("foo")

foo.default <- function(y, ...) {}

foo.formula <- function(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...) {
 ...
 do.call("foo", y=something appropriate,...)
}

If I recall it correctly, foo.formula is the only function that is allowed
to have different arguments than the generic function has (at least by R
CMD check).

Now, using `setGeneric' and `setMethod': 

R> library(methods)
R> 
R> setGeneric("foo", function(y, ...) standardGeneric("foo"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> setMethod("foo", signature(y="numeric"),
+ function(y, ...) print("foo with numeric"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> setMethod("foo", signature(y="formula"),
+ function(y, ...) print("foo with formula"))
[1] "foo"
R> 
R> foo(x ~ a)
[1] "foo with formula"
R> foo(1:10)
[1] "foo with numeric"

fine. But is it possible to have a method that has an argument `formula'
instead of `y', at least for the sake of compatibility with the classical
way? 

Torsten

There is a simple solution: use the procedures which have long been
described in `Writing R Extensions' to turn your code into properly
formatted canonical code.  (That turns all left-assignments into
`<-', since that is the canonical form.).

It may be a non-problem for you, but it was for the original poster in
the original thread.

Running the following analysis gives as a result kukot vs. kisut.

aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
win.graph()
aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
            sukupuoli=rep(c("kukot","kisut"),
                          c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
    qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

However, running the following analysis, gives miehet vs. miehet.

 aikaero <- -27.5+5*(0:10)
 frekvenssi.m <- c(0,1,15,37,53,45,23,18,4,1,1)
 frekvenssi.n <- c(2,8,12,19,33,47,42,15,2,1,0)
 win.graph()
 aikaero <- rep(c(aikaero,aikaero), c(frekvenssi.m,frekvenssi.n))
 a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

This seems to happen everytime "sukupuoli" contains one variable name, which
starts with a letter "n". If both names start with "n" or other letters the
results is miehet vs naiset as expected.

So this works fine:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("nisset","naiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

And this also:

a.ero <- data.frame(aikaero,
        sukupuoli=rep(c("miehet","maiset"),
                      c(sum(frekvenssi.m),sum(frekvenssi.n))))
     qq(sukupuoli ~ aikaero, data=a.ero)

Where's the problem?

mention that and to give the version number of lattice that you used
to be sure of beeing able to reproduce this.

2) It seems that the plots are actually correct, just the labels are
wrong. You can correct that by specifying xlab and ylab in the call.

3) The error appears to be a typo:

    if (missing(ylab))
        ylab <- if (is.f.y)
            unique(levels(y))[y]
        else paste("y:", as.character(unique(levels(y)[[2]])))

should be [2] for consistency.

No.

This is one major difference in the "model" for method dispatch from the
"white book" methods.  The old-style methods are defined to re-match the
arguments to the generic before calling the method.

The formal methods are dispatched by evaluating the _body_ of the method
in the frame of the call to the generic, without rematching arguments.

Aside from potential efficiency, the rationale is that the generic
defines the "meaning" or intention of the function, and the methods are,
literally, different methods to implement that intention.

There's nothing very deep here:  obviously you can say
  setMethod("foo", "formula", function(y, ...)foo.formula(y, ...))

We could even re-define the API so that setMethod did roughly the
equivalent automatically, but on the whole the potential for confusion
seems to outweigh the convenience.

This feature request is already implemented in R-devel.

It is not a bug, as why should logical NA be convertible to any other
format?

Subject: Changes to the methods package
Message-ID: <3D221B02.C5B6CC13@research.bell-labs.com>

A new version was checked in to r-devel today.  These are the main
changes:

1.  Objects from the methods package are no longer copied into base.  As
a result, the behavior of data.class and all.equal should be the same
whether methods are attached or not.  (The methods package no longer
uses data.class.)  Also, detaching the methods package should restore
the behavior of class() to the S3 version.

The change should fix the bugs reported on these two topics.

The downside (perhaps) of the change is that class() and data.class()
will now occasionally be inconsistent when methods is attached. 
class(1:1) is "integer", but data.class(1:1) is "numeric".

2.  The representation of classes is now via an actual class,
"classRepresentation".  The metadata objects for class definitions are
objects from this class.  (Before, the class representation was a
special-purpose hack, partly to avoid bootstrapping problems.)

*** This means that packages using methods need to be installed from
source to make their metadata objects correct.  ****

The change repairs an inconsistency with the green book description
(section 7.6 in particular).

Also, the changes are a step on the way to making classes, like generic
functions, belong to a particular package.  Evenutually one should be
able to deal with the same class name on different packages to refer to
different classes.

3.  Metadata objects have been introduced to represent inheritance
information (both "superclass" extensions and "subclass" relations). 
Subclass information is now maintained in the cached class definitions 
(it's needed to maintain consistency when class relations change).

At the same time, the "extends" relation has been refined, to introduce
the notion of "simple" extensions.

A class extends another in a simple form if either: a) one class
contains another, in the setClass definition; or b) a class extends a
virtual class by a simple setIs declaration.

In the new form, objects can be supplied in certain situations from a
class that is a simple extension of the target class, with no change in
the actual object.  In particular, slots can be assigned without losing
their original class.

The idea here is very similar to the extension previously made to the
API that allowed extending classes to be used as arguments in method
dispatch, without the objects being altered.

There is some discussion of simple extensions and the rationale on the
developer's web page, at
http://developer.r-project.org/simpleExtension.html

Subject: R windows FAQ (PR#1733)
Message-ID: <200207022149.XAA03302@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Kevin Wright
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Windows 95
Submission from: (NULL) (170.54.59.160)


In the R windows FAQ, item 3.6 (Package TclTk does not work) currently has this
line:

  Sys.putenv("TCL_LIBRARY"="c:/Program Files/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3")

I find that if I execute the following two lines after starting R, I can then do
library(tcltk) and demo(tkdensity) as usual.  I do not need to modify my
autoexec.bat this way!

Anyway, using the following two lines in the FAQ might be useful to some
people.

Sys.putenv("TCL_LIBRARY"="c:/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3")
Sys.putenv("PATH"=paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"),
                        ";c:\\tcl\\bin;",
                        Sys.getenv("R_HOME"),
                        "\\library\\tcltk\\libs",sep=""))

Humbly (and aplogies for any incorrect terminology)

Why do you need that?  In particular, why do you need
.../library/tcltk/libs in the PATH?

Both the README and the FAQ already tell you to put the Tcl/Tk DLLs in
the your path, so why does the information need to be repeated?
Unless something went wrong in your Tcl/Tk installation, they will be in
your path, so why put them in a second time?

Where is the bug?

I think this should be seen as an alternative way to put them in your
path.  Windows documentation is very unclear about how to get
something put into your path.

For example, on my system, tcl is not in my path; I "installed" Tcl/Tk
by just copying the whole directory from another system.  The
Sys.putenv commands make it work.

.../library/tcltk/libs should not be in the PATH: it's misinformation.

Well, a correct command would be better.

Subject: complex numbers in library function (PR#1737)
Message-ID: <200207031225.OAA08552@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Alex Deckmyn
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux Mandrake 7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (193.190.63.62)


A short function in a library contains the complex number -2i :

phihat <- function(x)
  {
x+ (-2i)
  }


If i read the source file with source("phihat") this works fine. If I include it
as
 a function in a library and read it with library(test), the function is still 
read corectly, but when I print it out it shows as

> phihat
function (x)
{
    x + (-0+2i)
}

Internally R still uses (-2i) though:
> phihat(0)
[1] 0-2i

The problem only seems to occur when the function is part of a library. 
When I read the same function via source:

> source("~/software/R-libs/test/R/test")
> phihat
function(x)
  {
x+ (-2i)
  }

Usually I work in emacs using ESS. When I edit the function phihat (Ctrl-C
Ctrl-d)
 I get the bad representation and after reloading the function (ctrl-c ctrl-l) 
the function has changed. quite a dangerous bug, I think, though I admit my
Linux 
version is quite old.

This looks like bug  PR#1697 in the deparser.  I've written a patch

The difference is that in the first case R keeps the source of the
function (in attr(phihat,'source')).  In the second case it deparses
the internal representation.

nchar(NA)
strwidth(NA)
strheight(NA)

Why then do we have as.character(NA)?
Isn't it standard, that a as.something() function can handle NAs? Isn't it
good style to explicitely use as.something(NA) instead of relying on
auto-coercion? Isn't it a language feature that we can assign NA to any element of a
vector, especially if NA is a legal (creatable) element? 

Puzzled

We also have as.character(T) and as.character(F): it's coercion of logicla
vectors which is implemented.

A POSIXct class (say) is not a vector, strictly. The problem is that `NA'
is a _logical_ vector, and although one can reasonably coerce NA, one
cannot coerce T and F.  So it needs special-case code, and I don't think
you will find it documented anywhere that this needs to work.

Subject: R windows FAQ (PR#1733)
Message-ID: <200207031523.RAA10380@pubhealth.ku.dk>


I installed the Tcl/Tk software from www.activestate.com .

The installer did not add the Tcl/Tk DLLs to my PATH.  (Probably it should,
but I don't think the installer provided me with the option of modifying the
PATH.)

I am creating an R package that will be distributed to people who may not
have permission/skill to modify the PATH settings in Windows, so I was
excited to figure out that it was possible to set the PATH after starting R.
(I will do this in the R package)

It was a VERY useful trick for me, which is why I submitted the suggestion.

I may be the only person to find the suggestion useful, in which case it
wouldn't make sense to modify the FAQ.

I think the definitions are different, and they are not #defines.

This comes up all the time with Windows headers.  Usually you need to
include the one you do not need first, then #undef some conflicts
and include the other.  But qglobal is not using a #define, so you can
I think use something like

#include <qt.h>
#define TRUE R_TRUE
#define FALSE R_FALSE
#include <R.h>

I don't see how, except via the above define trick.

Subject: lattice default aspect fails for some data sets (PR#1744)
Message-ID: <200207041901.VAA18450@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Dieter Menne
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Win2000
Submission from: (NULL) (212.185.252.129)


Lattice Version: 0.5-3

There is a problem in print.trellis that can lead to an
error reported as follows:

Error in rep(x$x.between, length = cols.per.page - 1) : 
        invalid number of copies in "rep"
In addition: Warning messages: 
1: argument lengths differ in: split(x, f) 
2: NAs introduced by coercion 

The error only turns up with certain data sets and 
device/aspect ratios and can be tracked down to the following:

    if(x$layout[1]==0) { # using device dimensions to
        ddim <- par("din") # calculate default layout
        device.aspect <- ddim[2]/ddim[1]
        panel.aspect <- if(layout.respect) panel.height else 1

        plots.per.page <- x$layout[2]
##### m can be zero, depending on data
        m <- round(sqrt(x$layout[2] * device.aspect/panel.aspect))
        n <- ceiling(x$layout[2]/m)
        x$layout[1] <- n


Quick Fix (works for me, but not tested with different data sets):

>> replace "round" by "ceiling"

Workaround (always works): Use explicit "aspect".

nlme Version: 3.1-27

gsummary fails if any of the columns contains an NA.

 varying <- unlist(lapply(object, function(column, frst) {
        aux <- as.character(column)
        any(aux != aux[frst])
    }, frst = asFirst))

Error in if (any(varying) && (!invariantsOnly)) { : 
        missing value where logical needed

This probably is by design (an more verbose error message would help),
but as a consequence augPred also fails even if
the column is not used at all in the fit.

Jens,

I put a fix in, but it caused other problems and I am now not sure about
this and will revert it.  Thanks for raising the issue, but the answers do
not seem incorrect to me.

If nchar(x) gives the number of characters in the string, then of course
the result should be NA.  However, it seems to be widely used as the
number of characters in the printed representation of a string, when 2
is correct. (E.g. in format.character.)

I am less clear about strwidth and strheight.  In general an NA string
will not be plotted, so 0 seems the appropriate answer, but if it were
plotted the current answer is correct.

Calling strwidth or strheight on a logical vector (and NA is logical)
is correctly an error.

point 1 is user error: there are only fonts 1 to 5 documented anywhere
for this device.  pdf() in R-devel has been Holtman-proofed.

point 2 is also user error: the text falls on the boundary of the plot

cannot.  Use xpd=TRUE if you want to plot on the edge of the region.

Sorry I forgot to fix this earlier. I've replaced round with ceiling in the
development version of lattice, and will try to look out for any unexpected
problems.

There is no bug.  The error message tells you that your function gives a
result of the wrong length - that means your function should give a result
with length the same as that of the input argument, x.

Try either of the following

> integrate(function(x) 1 + 0*x, 0, 1)
> integrate(function(x) rep(1, length(x)), 0, 1)

If you spot the message in these it could be the start of a seminal lesson
on vectorization.

I think people should read the documentation more carefully before sending
e-mail to R-bugs to make sure that they understand their problem correctly.
If in doubt, the problem should be reported to the R-help list.

I do not think there is anything wrong with integrate.  Here is a relevant
excerpt from the man page:

>      f: An R function taking a numeric first argument and returning a
>         numeric vector the same length. Returning a non-finite
>         element will generate an error.

This simply means that the function has to be properly vectorized.  Your
first example - the constant function - is not.  If you replaced it with
something like

      integrate(function(x) rep(1, length(x)), 0, 1)

integrate would work properly.

Your second function works correctly since x^2 returns a vector result of
the same length as x.  The last one is really strange.  I think integrate
should return an error message in this case.

This is user error.  The help for integrate says the first argument is
"An R function taking a numeric first argument and returning a
numeric vector the same length."  

The function has to return a vector answer when a vector argument is
given to it.

>This simply means that the function has to be properly vectorized. 

By the way, sometimes vectorizing is ugly.  Here's a simple function
that should vectorize any function that's designed to take a scalar as
the first argument.

vectorize <- function (f) 
{
  function(x,...)
  { 
     result <- rep(f(x[1],...),length(x))  # this sets type and length
     for (i in 2:length(x)) result[i] <- f(x[i],...)
     result
  }
}

It's slow, and it's ugly, but it lets the original failing example
work:

> integrate(function(x)1,0,1)
Error in integrate(function(x) 1, 0, 1) : evaluation of function gave
a result of wrong length
> integrate(vectorize(function(x)1),0,1)
1 with absolute error < 5.6e-15

have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

--Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
--
--There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
--To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
--Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
--cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
--internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
--This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
--mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
--(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
--and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

Thanks much. I downloaded the source and see the problem. I misinterpreted
the manual as meaning that any function that took a single argument and
returned a single argument would be fine, when the manual and the error
message were trying to tell me that the function should simply be vectorized.
Obvious in retrospect. Sorry to have bothered you about it.
kind regards, -travis porco

thanks--i found this out when i looked at the source. i misinterpreted the
manual. since i had intended the function to take a scalar and return a
scalar, my function seemed to be correct; the intent of the manual page
was to have the user write a vectorized function, as you say, to return a
vector of function values when a vector of argument values is given to it.

Hmm:

  const gint bufsize = 2048;
  gchar buf[bufsize];

is the culprit, so a quick fix should be obvious (just use #define
instead). But is this usage of "const" variables an un-ANSI C
extension in GCC, or is it the HP C compiler that is to blame??

It's not in ANSI C89, though it is in C99.

The initialiser must be a constant expression and in C (but not C++) a
const-qualified variable doesn't qualify.

The reason I've seen for this is that the value of a const-qualfied
variable is known at link time but not necessarily at compile time.

Subject: as.character.octmode() and format.octmode() (PR#1759)
Message-ID: <200207082249.AAA04422@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Henrik Bengtsson
Version: 1.5.1
OS: WinMe
Submission from: (NULL) (217.210.0.243)


PROBLEM:

With

  x <- 0; class(x) <- "octmode"

Should 

  as.character(x)

and

  format(x)

give "" and not "0"?

SUGGESTION/SOLUTION:

Here is one fix that gives "0" instead:

as.character.octmode <- function(x, ...) {
  if (!inherits(x, "octmode"))
    stop("calling wrong method")
  isna <- is.na(x)
  y <- x[!isna]
  ans0 <- character(length(y))
  z <- NULL                          # FIX 01
  while (any(y > 0) | is.null(z)) {  # FIX 02
    z <- y%%8
    y <- floor(y/8)
    ans0 <- paste(z, ans0, sep="")
  }
  ans <- rep(as.character(NA), length(x))
  ans[!isna] <- ans0
  ans
}


Same for format.octmode().

Subject: svd() very slow for wide matrix X but not for t(X) (PR#1761)
Message-ID: <200207091540.RAA08921@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Hi All,

A colleague has just pointed out to me prcomp is *much* slower and memory
intensive when applied to very wide matrixes than when applied to the
transpose of the same matrix.  In looking for the reason, I discovered that
that the singular value decomposition function svd is the primary culprit:

On my Solaris workstation, under R 1.5.1:

	>  nr <- 50
	>  nc <- 1000
	>  x  <- matrix( rnorm( nr*nc), nrow=nr, ncol=nc )
	>  tx <- t(x)
	>
	> # SVD directly on matrix is SLOW
	>  system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 5.41 0.00 5.62 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # SVD directly on t(matrix) is FAST
	>  system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.61 0.00 0.00
	>
	> # but the results are (essentially) identical
	> max( abs(val.x) - abs(val.tx) )
	[1] 4.201361e-13

The speed difference gets worse as the number of columns grows.  

Here is a simple patch to $R_SRC/src/library/base/R/svd.R that works around
the problem.  It simply checks whether the matrix is wider than it is long,
and if so, calls itself on the transpose of the matrix, and then exchanges
the returned u and v matrixes.


*** svd.R.orig Tue Jul  9 11:06:46 2002
--- svd.R Tue Jul  9 11:06:49 2002
***************
*** 5,10 ****
--- 5,17 ----
      n <- dx[1]
      p <- dx[2]
      if(!n || !p) stop("0 extent dimensions")
+ 
+     if( p > n )  # compute on the transpose if wide
+       {
+         s <- svd( t(x), nv=nu, nu=nv)
+         return( d=s$d, u=s$v, v=s$u )
+       }
+     
      if (is.complex(x)) {
          res <- La.svd(x, nu, nv)
          return(list(d = res$d, u = if(nu) res$u, v = if(nv)
Conj(t(res$vt))))


With this patch the speed is almost the same whether called on x or tx:

	> system.time( val.x <- svd(x)$u )
	[1] 0.62 0.00 0.66 0.00 0.00

	> system.time( val.tx <- svd(tx)$v )
	[1] 0.60 0.00 0.86 0.00 0.00

	> identical( val.x, val.tx )
	[1] TRUE

This is fine for my purposes, but perhaps someone familiar with the FORTRAN
code should see why its performance is so unbalanced.

This may be of interest:

http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/

It looks like this version may well be more complete and conform the standards than the version that comes with R.

BTW: I am currently patching unix/sys_std.c and modules/gtkconsole.c such that they don't store lines in the history that are identical to the previous line. Is there any interest in posting those patches here?

Peter (and others):

AFAIK, gcc is the only C compiler that allows this sort of fortran-like syntax. Mighty handy, but not portable at all. However, behind the screens, it translates this (more or less) into a call to alloca(). This is a function that is part of most modern systems, and of which portable versions can be found (outside the glibc source tree). BTW: debugging code that allocates arrays like this is not trivial, as on all systems I've seen, you cannot directly access element n as array[n] (from within gdb, that is).

There is a comprehensive whitepaper about gcc's not-portable-outside-gcc quirks available on Metrowerk's site, called Porting GNU C Programs to Metrowerks' CodeWarrior C Compiler.

Variable-length arrays aren't that unpopular an extension.  They are in
the Sun Workshop compiler, for example.

However in this case there *isn't* a variable-length array, it's just a
fixed length array declared by someone who didn't realise that a const
variable isn't a constant expression.

Or, using the canonical scheme for regional CRAN mirrors:

http://cran.au.r-project.org

which seems to work fine (and of course it is identical to
cran.planetmirror.com).

If the diff are relatively small and look good, the chances are
relatively high the inc. will happen.

I think this is a very useful idea -- though I probably will
almost never make use of it, using ESS 99.5% of the time.

Subject: bug in all.equal.character (PR#1767)
Message-ID: <200207101252.OAA13802@pubhealth.ku.dk>

There is a bug in all.equal.character:

> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", "C"))
[1] TRUE
> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))

       sum(out), " in target")
1: all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))
> 

It appears that there is a typo in all.equal.character. "out" is never created.

> all.equal.character
function (target, current, ...) 
{
    lt <- length(target)
    lc <- length(current)
    if (lt != lc) {
        msg <- paste("Lengths (", lt, ", ", lc, ") differ (string compare on first ", 
            ll <- min(lt, lc), ")", sep = "")
        ll <- seq(length = ll)
        target <- target[ll]
        current <- current[ll]
    }
    else msg <- NULL
    nas <- is.na(target)
    if (any(nas != is.na(current))) 
        return(paste("`is.NA' value mismatches:", sum(is.na(current)), 
            "in current,", sum(out), " in target"))
    ne <- !nas & (target != current)
    if (!any(ne) && is.null(msg)) 
        TRUE
    else if (any(ne)) 
        c(msg, paste(sum(ne), "string mismatches"))
    else msg
}
> 

Perhaps "sum(out)" should be "sum(is.na(target))"? That change would lead to:

> all.equal.character(c("A", "B", "C"), c("A", "B", NA))
[1] "`is.NA' value mismatches: 1 in current, 0  in target"

  The version included in R has been "grafted" from a project called 'wget', 
as far as I have read the comments in vsnprintf.c . Those same comments also 
mention a list of issues, that may have been solved, but maybe not -- I 
haven't tried. It is quite possible that it works well enough as far as R is 
concerned. The version on the link I sent works well too (I use it under 
Irix), and according to its website, it complies to all standards that 
apply. And it *is* free: one can choose between the Artistic License and the 
GPL.

>only if they might be incorporated in to a future version of R  :--)
>If the diff are relatively small and look good, the chances are

  My intention is indeed they *be* incorporated in a future version -- that 
would save me from having to apply the same patch each time R bumps a 
version digit >8-
It sure looks the diffs are going to be small, since (fortunately) adding to 
the history is done in a single place. The terminal version works, the gtk 
version still needs some polishing that I hope to finish today.
What do you mean with looking good?

>I think this is a very useful idea -- though I probably will
>almost never make use of it, using ESS 99.5% of the time.

You'll see just how useful when you do have to step down to the terminal or 
gtk based version :)

yes.  Definitely a bug introduced by cut&paste (from *.numeric).
It will be fixed in R-patched and R-devel by this night.

Subject: bug(?) in R FAQ - Should I run R from within Emacs? (PR#1772)
Message-ID: <200207110822.KAA17398@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I have a small request re.

R FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions on R
Version 1.5-10, 2002-06-13
ISBN 3-901167-51-X
Kurt Hornik


In section 6.2 Should I run R from within Emacs? The faq says

"Yes, definitely." 

This led me to install emacs, and to install ess. However, I use a windows
environment (mswindows2000) and I had some difficulty installing, linking
and launching these applications. After several hours I had launched emacs
but had failed to link it with either ess or r, partly because of platform
problems. (As a dedicated windows user, I am reluctant to tinker with
autoexec.bat and the like).

I spent several hours doing this, and in hindsight, I decided to uninstall
emacs and ess.
 
I would prefer if the faq could be changed to say:

"This is optional."

And perhaps some comment could be made about platforms. I found the
documentation for emacs and ess to be a bit of a hair-pulling exercise. NOT
one of the "plug and play" applications that MS windows is so fond of! 

By the way, I like the r gui very much. I used splus for some time as a PhD
student, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that my scripts run in r!! I
intend to use r from now onwards, and to encourage my colleagues to use it
too.

Kind regards,

For the cost of one of those plug and play apps that your OS is so
fond of, I'd be happy to provide a simple install.  Would you like to
know where to send your check to?  

(In fact, for XEmacs, we have).

Sure, no problem.  The one I choose is... R!  It's got a simple
install.  Where do you want the check for R's license fee sent?

>(In fact, for XEmacs, we have).

Thanks!  You guys are fast!

So, use the XEmacs InstallShield installer.

Once it's installed, use the tools->packages facility to add ESS.
Use the options->edit init file, add "(require 'ess-site)" (w/o
quotes). 

It works with R. 

Not tested with other tools (i.e. I did nearly exactly this on MacOS
X)

As far as I can see, you never actually link against the tcl/tk
libraries (-ltcl -ltk) so you'd need more stuff in TCLTK_LIBS. Or
maybe simply *not* set it and let configure work it out.

Thanks a lot, I'll incorporate the changes (or something along those
lines) together with my next Sweave updates.

Subject: Minor bug in dlnorm (PR#1781)
Message-ID: <200207121943.VAA26420@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The density of a lognormal should be 0 for negative arguments, but

> dlnorm(-1)
[1] NaN
Warning message: 
NaNs produced in: dlnorm(x, meanlog, sdlog, log) 

A simple fix is to change dlnorm's definition to:

function (x, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1, log = FALSE) 
.Internal(dlnorm(x*(x>0), meanlog, sdlog, log))

It might be faster to put the same sort of adjustment into the
internal code, but I couldn't spot where that lives.

In src/nmath/dlnorm.c.  I fixed it there.

Maybe, but what is in R does what R requires, and has been thoroughly
tested.  I don't propose to do the work again!

8-) Maybe, but what is in R does what R requires, and has been thoroughly
8-) tested.  I don't propose to do the work again!

This is of course entirely up to the judgement of the R-Core members. I can't begin to oversee what subtle formatting documented and undocumented commands R uses, nor how much work it will be to test another version for compliance with R's needs. I have tested only the standard behaviour of the version referenced above, which works, well, standardly, and compilation and using the library was a breeze (on Irix 6.2; there is a thorough test included).
It should be kept in mind however that on most systems where R runs, snprintf c.s. are available, likely in uptodate versions that conform to all or most of the approbriate standards. In other words, they evolve, as R's use of them may, and as the included version will most probably not. This was my main reason to point out the existence of an independent snprintf library that looks like it is being maintained, not some idea R's included version is not up to the task!

I was trying to get the package yags 3.20 by Vince Carey

the

Those were the facts. R FAQ: Bugs warns against trying to provide an 
explanation for what happens.  However, I was unable to resist trying 
to figure out what was wrong.

There was a duplicated slot name in the yags source code the triggered
this "stop" function, but apparently the 'sep = ""' argument has slipped
out of the parentheses following the 'paste' function and is now an argument
to the 'stop' function instead, which generates the 'unused argument(s)' 
error. This occurs in the function 'representation' in the file 
SClasses.R in the methods directory of the R source. The same typo
occurs in the same function a few lines above it. The following diff
indicates at which lines these 'stop' functions occur:

tykki:~/R-1.5.1/src/library/methods/R# diff  SClasses.R.old SClasses.R
33c33
<         stop(paste("Duplicate class names among superclasses:",
paste(includes[duplicated(includes)], collapse = ", ")), sep="")

collapse="")), sep="")
---
>        stop(paste("Duplicated slot names: ", paste(slots[duplicated(slots)],
collapse=""), sep=""))
---
I am no sure if the 'sep = ""' argument is intended for the first or the
second of the 'paste' functions.


I have separately notified the author of yags about the problem there.

Hello

I had a problem in reading in an EPS file from R into Star Office 5.2 - although
it 
works for several other word processors. The online support at Sun helped me
with the following reply, indicating that the export of EPS from R was faulty.

You might like to update this, at least it would be helpful for Linux/Star
Office users.

Regards

KP

Reply from SUN SUPPORT ->

Hi Kenneth, 
Loading problems with EPS files can appear if in the file format header the file
format information is missing (so-called "Magic"). This can be caused by the
program which exported the EPS file. In this case, please inform the
manufacturer of the program which causes the faulty EPS export. In the TGIF
created EPS files, the first line reads: 

%! 

StarOffice expects however: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0 

If you manually modify the line, StarOffice can read this file without a
problem. 

Hope this helps, 

Sanal

What did you do to make an EPS file?  This would appear to be user error,
not a bug, as R does create the right header when producing EPS files.


Following ?postscript (or using dev.copy2eps) gives

postscript(file="test.eps", width = 4.0, height = 3.0,
           horizontal = FALSE, onefile = FALSE)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

gannet% head test.eps
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Helvetica
...

And if you omit onefile=FALSE, you get

%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Helvetica
...

and *never* %!

Patches will be considered.  No one is currently working on the Windows
GUI, and its originator, Guido Masarotto, is no longer active in R.

(That is probably not easily possible: take a look at the code to see

The outer call.

Thanks.

It might be nice to have stop() take multiple arguments in the same
style as warning() to save  typographical errors for those of us with
parenthesis-dislexia.  Looks like the same one-line addition,
      if(nargs() == 0) message <- NULL else message <- paste(...,
sep="")
would work in stop().

That discrepancy between warning() and stop() has always puzzled me.
I've just altered stop() to allow multiple arguments.

The outer call.

Thanks.

It might be nice to have stop() take multiple arguments in the same
style as warning() to save  typographical errors for those of us with
parenthesis-dislexia.  Looks like the same one-line addition,
      if(nargs() == 0) message <- NULL else message <- paste(...,
sep="")
would work in stop().

Subject: R crashes when using "xyplot" (PR#1801)
Message-ID: <200207171342.PAA14387@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hello,

using the function xyplot I repeatedly had R crashing.

One example is from the book of Mick Crawley (Stat. Computing in Splus), where
the commandline reads: xyplot(Weight~Age|Genotype, pch=16)
I also had the same phenomenon with my own data and commands even simpler.

I reinstalled lattice, because on loading the package I got an error message
that the lattice.dll couldn't be found. However that wasn't the cause of the
problem. I downloaded the package again from a different mirror site, all in
vain.
This is the simplest code I could create to crash R with xyplot:
> x_runif(100)
> y_rnorm(100)
> plot(x,y)
> xyplot(y~x)
CRASH!

Best wishes,

Carsten

Try the current version of R: yours is long obselete and I suspect has a
mismatched version of grid.  The current version comes with grid/lattice.

Please read what a bug is and how to report a bug.
With recent versions of R (R-1.4.0 is not recent!), lattice and grid I
cannot reproduce the crash.

Uwe Ligges

BTW: 
- For good reasons, "_" will be depreciated shortly, AFAIK.
- I'd suggest to avoid random numbers for code in bug reports.

Not unless set.seed() is called, I suppose?

hi,

I'm a bit new to R and need a hand importing some data.
I have a data set with jut x,y pairs in it:

x1,y1
x2,y2
x3,y3

I can read it in fine, but I would like to do some cluster analysis on it.
So I'll need to get it the proper data structure. Any ideas?

Thanks,
j.

Subject: Fault in anova.glm (PR#1807)
Message-ID: <200207180650.IAA16820@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When anova.glm is given several models to compare it ignores any prescribed
dispersion parameter.

An example:


> library (MASS)
> cond1 <- c(20, 50, 3, 9, 15, 20) 	
> cond2 <- c(18, 32, 44, 180, 25, 17) 	
> cond3 <- c(4, 11, 12, 44, 15, 6) 	
> testData <- data.frame(res = c(cond1, cond2, cond3),
+        conditions = factor(rep(1:3, c(6,6,6)))) 
> fm <- glm( res ~ conditions, family = negative.binomial(theta = 1),
testData)
> fm0 <- update(fm, .~1)
> anova(fm0, fm, test="Chisq", dispersion = 1)
Analysis of Deviance Table

Model 1: res ~ 1
Model 2: res ~ conditions
  Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance P(>|Chi|)
1        17    16.8979                      
2        15    11.6307  2   5.2672    0.0668

On the other hand:

> 1 - pchisq(5.2672, 2)
[1] 0.07181945
> 

The fix:

Replace line 16 of anova.glm:

        return(anova.glmlist(c(list(object), dotargs), test = test))

by

	return(anova.glmlist(c(list(object), dotargs), 
		dispersion = dispersion, test = test))

When using read.table to read a data file section by section, I get an error
that indicates R is attempting to read more "fields" than exist.

The Data file looks like this:

eof-----

I have an array of skip values, and the number of lines to read after the skip
values:

skip.lines<-4  #number of lines between task headers
skip.1<-2      #number of lines to the first task header
n.tasks<-10     #number of tasks in the file
n.lines<-1     #number of lines per task (excluding header)

tmp<-seq(1,n.tasks)
skip<- skip.1 + skip.lines * (tmp -1)

# and the read.table is in a loop:

for (i in 1:n.tasks) {
    i.dat<-read.table("tmp.txt",  sep=",", strip.white=TRUE, fill=TRUE,
skip=skip[i], nrows=n.lines, header=FALSE)
    i.name<-substr(names(i.dat)[7],1,4)

    more stuff here
}

When only the first block (first 5 rows) of the file are used, there is no
problem.  When the subsequent blocks are included, R appears to be looking for
more "fields" in the rows 3 and 4 than actually exist.  Changing to header=FALSE
allows me to see all the data, but then I have to transform from character to
numeric and I don't get the names in the data frame.

This script works if the data file has more than one row of data below the
header. (Just cut and paste a data row)

Regards,

michael.

Subject: R-devel Mac OSX build wierdness...
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10207190041300.26875-100000@hsph.harvard.edu>

I encountered some wierdness when building R-devel (latest rsync) on OSX
using commandline tools (as opposed to the Carbon GUI and
whatnot...probably just laziness on my part but it generally works :-)).

At any rate, sometime between 2002-07-05 and the present the configure
scripts started setting INSTALL_DATA to ${R_HOME}/bin/install -c in
Makeconf...which causes wierdness for the Mac OSX (10.1.5) version of sh
(which is actually zsh I believe) as it tries to use INSTALL and make
simply fails. Of course, even with a sensible shell this should fail as
${R_HOME}/bin/install doesn't exist. Changing this to '/usr/bin/install
-c' allowed the build to proceed normally.

I solved this problem by using explicit paths to the libraries in the 
compilation (I think this was the important change).

You can close this bug.

Thanks for the help, Jeremy

Hard to believe.  The Autoconf code has

[AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_INSTALL])
case "${INSTALL}" in
  [[\\/]]* | ?:[[\\/]]* ) # absolute
    ;;
  *)
    INSTALL="\$\(top_srcdir\)/tools/install-sh -c"
    ;;
esac
])# R_PROG_INSTALL

so either you end up with something absolute or the string in the
default clause.

I assume this is a combination of you putting R_HOME/bin in your PATH
and MacOSX being case-insensitive in some cases?

The problem appears to be with as.POSIXct on the Mac.  Operations that
don't coerce to POSIXct work, those that do, don't.

I think I've found why.

The epoch date on the Mac is 1904-1-1 not 1970-1-1.

This has two effects. First, everything's off by 66 years. Second, it's
important to treat the time as unsigned long, not long, since it's already
greater than 2^31 some time in 1997.

Aren't standards wonderful?

Subject: bug in R-1.5.1 for Mac OS X installer (PR#1825)
Message-ID: <200207222341.BAA05215@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi,

Thanks for developing an outstanding software for free. I admire all your 
effort greatly. I would like to submit a bug report on the R-1.5.1 
installer (in .mpkg, .pkg format) for Mac OS X.

I'm using fink in conjunction with Darwin. In my environment, /usr/local is 
symbolically linked to /sw which is fink's main directory. This is to 
conform the directory structure on my machine to the standard UNIX/Linux 
one.

It turned out that R-1.5.1 installer ignores the symbolic link and creates 
new /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib directories on their own, thereby 
installing all its stuff into them. This is really annoying. (Actually, 
after installing R, bash stopped running. At first, I couldn't figure out 
at all what happened. It turned out that bash failed to runs because it 
lost access dynamic libraries in /usr/local/lib directory.)

I hope the installer properly follows symbolic links during installation.

Cheers,
Kow

Hello

Thanks for the report. Do you have

/usr/local->/sw

or

/sw->/usr/local

i.e. which one of the two only exists as a soft link ? Probably /sw,  
i.e.
fink really installs in /usr/local.

It is generally bad to confound /sw and /usr/local, see

http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/general.php#usr-local

The R installer tries to install in /sw (fink stuff) and in /usr/local
(R stuff). It must get confused when it is trying to locate /sw/lib,
deciding this does not exist, then creating it as /usr/local/lib.
Same for /sw/bin. I don't think there is much I can do about it,
it's what the Installer does. I can warn people.

By the way, where was your bash executable ? This was not
overwritten ?

Full_Name: Jerome Asselin
Version: 1.5.1
OS: linux redhat 7.2
Submission from: (NULL) (142.103.173.179)



gsub() return different answers depending on how the input
variables were created. Here is an example of code that
replicates the problem. The vectors y and yy appear to be
the same, but gsub() doesn't return the same answer.
It should remove all the blanks when I use the vector y,
but it doesn't remove them all. I have also tested that
the same problem occurs if sub() is used instead of gsub().

x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",
     .Label = c("1 ", "2 ", "3 ", "4 ", "5 "))
y <- as.character(x)
y
gsub(" ","",y)

yy <- c("1 ","3 ","4 ","5 ")
yy
gsub(" ","",yy)


Below is the output that I have when I execute those commands.

Those are not blanks!  You have character <A0> in there. less on your
email gives me

> x <- structure(c(1, 3, 4, 5), class = "factor",
+      .Label = c("1 ", "2 ", "3 ", "4<A0>", "5<A0>"))

[1] "1"  "3"  "4<A0>" "5<A0>"

which is correct.

Pilot error, I believe ....

I can't reproduce this (1.5.1, Debian Linux). I get

There used to be a possible bug where the R length and C length of a
string would be different (PR#1724), which might cause that sort of thing,
but the known manifestations of it were removed in 1.5.1

Yes. I immediately noticed it when I viewed my bug report on the 
internet. Those characters appeared blank on my screen before I 
submitted the bug report. I tried to submit a change for this bug, but 
perhaps I don't have the privilege to do so. Sorry about this...

Dear Michael Camann,

My concern was after having a hetero-computing environment for many years, I
found that I had to keep an old version of Microsoft Windows based
applications to be able to interact with my constituents. This at times can
become very expensive. I have had to limit my budget on the UNIX/Linux
platform to compensate for Microsoft Windows based applications.

With Open Office 1.0.1 this is a move in a positive direction. Currently, I
am Sun Microsystems Certified, of which, Sun Microsystems is one of the
contributors to the Open Office 1.0.1 multi-platform application. I am also,
Microsoft Windows Certified along with experience on the HP-UX, IBM AIX,
OS/2, Open Software Foundation, Silicon Graphics, Digital VMS/UNIX (HP),
True 64, Novell, Banyan Vines, BSD, Macintosh and a few others at or above
the level of Certification. But, the problem exists with having to pay for
each platform's certification. As you can see, I am not just limited to two
platforms.

I will just take a step back and let you know that I have been involved with
multi-platform systems for over twenty years, so, I have seen a improvement
over the years. The key factors here are "Cost, Efficiency, Development,
Production and Usability of Fully Functioning Applications!" We need to be
able to get things done and they cannot all be done under a mono-platform.
That is why we have stereo or hetero-computing environments.

We must be able to communicate in stereo and do it on a positive plain. Just
like, 3D or 4D.

I am honored you took time out of your busy scheduled to respond to my
e-mail. It goes to show, we all have a role in life and though it may seem
simplistic by design, on a difference plain it is important. Many thanks,
Michael Camann.

Sincerely,
Shawn Hornsby

Message-ID: <200207240134.DAA10432@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Dear Michael Camann,

My concern was after having a hetero-computing environment for many years, I
found that I had to keep an old version of Microsoft Windows based
applications to be able to interact with my constituents. This at times can
become very expensive. I have had to limit my budget on the UNIX/Linux
platform to compensate for Microsoft Windows based applications.

With Open Office 1.0.1 this is a move in a positive direction. Currently, I
am Sun Microsystems Certified, of which, Sun Microsystems is one of the
contributors to the Open Office 1.0.1 multi-platform application. I am also,
Microsoft Windows Certified along with experience on the HP-UX, IBM AIX,
OS/2, Open Software Foundation, Silicon Graphics, Digital VMS/UNIX (HP),
True 64, Novell, Banyan Vines, BSD, Macintosh and a few others at or above
the level of Certification. But, the problem exists with having to pay for
each platform's certification. As you can see, I am not just limited to two
platforms.

I will just take a step back and let you know that I have been involved with
multi-platform systems for over twenty years, so, I have seen a improvement
over the years. The key factors here are "Cost, Efficiency, Development,
Production and Usability of Fully Functioning Applications!" We need to be
able to get things done and they cannot all be done under a mono-platform.
That is why we have stereo or hetero-computing environments.

We must be able to communicate in stereo and do it on a positive plain. Just
like, 3D or 4D.

I am honored you took time out of your busy scheduled to respond to my
e-mail. It goes to show, we all have a role in life and though it may seem
simplistic by design, on a difference plain it is important. Many thanks,
Michael Camann.

Sincerely,
Shawn Hornsby

Hi,

I asked some days ago how to guess the o.s. the machine is running. I
found that it is stored in a variable called  R_PLATFORM. Now I need a
full list of  all the values this variable can have because I need to set
an option  depending on the endianness of the platform in which we are
compiling the package.

 Anyone can help me? Thanks,

I don't think a complete list exists.  I'd suggest running R to find
out:  Platform()$endian gives the result you need, so something like
this works in Windows:

 echo cat(Platform()$endian) | Rterm --slave

R_PLATFORM is used set in etc/Renviron.  You can't find a complete
list, as R can be compiled on new platforms.  In any case, a user could
change the value.

The information you want is in the Rconfig.h header file, in
/* #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
which is uncommented on big-endian systems.

This *is* documented in `Writing R Extensions'.  From R code, look at
.Platform$endian.

Platform() is to be deprecated in the next release: please use
.Platform$endian instead.

I don't think that helps for p near 1. It might do so for p near 0,
though. (The whole thing is a bit esoteric since it only becomes
relevant when you want the upper tail and on a log scale.)

Could you give us an example of the problems please?  Otherwise how
will we know that we have solved them?

>     return log1p (-p) * (x + 1);

Please report the bug (see BUGS in the FAQ) and not the solution.  It
seems to me to be working fine for p as small as 10^(-8) which is already
way beyond a feasible application of a geometric (as an exponential would
be used instead).

Uwe,

The titles are not necessarily intended to be aliases.  units.Rd is
another one.  Once upon a time \title automatically generated a \alias,
but not for some time (and I've forgotten the reasoning).

I think this is confusing, as help.search shows the entry as Random(base)
but ?Random does not work.  On the other hand, ?Binomial does work, and
there is no object Binomial.  My preference would be to change
help.search, I think.

In any case, this is not an isolated instance.

Brian

Subject: R 1.5.1 (Windows) crashes on plotting density(rnorm(1000)) (PR#1837)
Message-ID: <200207261416.QAA24871@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I am experiencing a reproducible crash from the following statement:

plot(density(rnorm(1000)))

on R 1.5.1 on Windows 2000.

This is a dual-processor machine with 512Mb of RAM.  Please advise if 
further details of hardware/OS are needed.

If rgui.exe is in use, the crash occurs before the plot can be 
displayed.  If rterm.exe is in use, the plot appears, then the error (and 
crash).

A screen capture of the error dialog box  can be viewed/downloaded at

http://shrimp.ccfhrb.noaa.gov/~mprager/rcrash.png

I happen to have Compaq Fortran installed, and therefore a debugger appears 
after the crash.  As I know nothing about systems programming, the debugger 
information (assembler) is meaningless to me, but if it would be useful, I 
can reproduce the crash, save the debugger information, and send it along.

This seems similar to crashes experienced in S-Plus that have been 
attributed to that program's assuming certain behavior on illegal math 
operations, behavior reportedly reset by HP printer drivers.  I do have an 
HP printer installed (hardly avoidable in the PC world).  But that 
observation may be totally irrelevant.

Thanks!

   will we know that we have solved them?

Visual inspection.  The problem is that the original code performs an
operation, "1-p", with the potential of killing all precision.  Often

to log in order to solve this very problem.

   Please report the bug (see BUGS in the FAQ) and not the solution.  It
   seems to me to be working fine for p as small as 10^(-8) which is already
   way beyond a feasible application of a geometric (as an exponential would
   be used instead).

It is entirely likely that such values are unreasonable, but that is still
not a great reason for returning terrible results for something that is at
least theoretically sane.  The actual point where problems occur is going
to depend on your floating point hardware.  For me, p=1e-17 makes the old
version return zero (fundamentally wrong) and the new version non-zero.

Note, that variations of "log (1-p)" exist in other functions, such as
pbeta_raw.

But for p near 1 (you give near 0 below) the distribution is concentrated
almost entirely on a single point.

That's nowhere near one!

I think this amounts to

`if I were to do really silly things numerical inaccuracies might catch up
with me'.

That's true throughout R, but we do have better things to worry about.

How can a random result be reproducible?  You could have told us the seed
in use!   I've tried this ten times without a crash, on two separate
machines, one XP and one 2000.

There is advice on how to do this in a usable way in the rw-FAQ.

R is already well-protected against that HP bug (which does not occur on
WIndows 2000 BTW, and was discovered by me under Win98), and I do have an
HP printer installed.

I just tried it in a single processor WinXP machine, with no error.
It's conceivable that the value of the random seed has an effect, but
it's more likely something else.

The invalid operation error can definitely be triggered by code that
messes with the floating point control word.  I hadn't heard that
printer drivers do this, but it is common in video drivers.  Could you
check that you have the latest video driver (and printer driver)
installed?

I don't know an easy way to diagnose this error remotely.

Not \title, but \name.  This is how we started out.  We then realized
that e.g. we cannot have .Script.Rd so now we separate the name of the
documentation object from the topics it provides documentation for.

I do not see what is confusing.  Rd writers create a help file and use
\alias to register the topics documented.  We cannot assume that the
file name is a topic documented, see zScript.Rd which documents .Script.

Why should 'Random' be a topic documented?

help.start() has a bug because it incorrectly assumes that we can get
help on the name.  I will fix this by instead pointing to the *first*
alias in the documentation object.

Subject: predict() still not yet "safe".. (PR#1840)
Message-ID: <200207261812.UAA25583@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Executive Summary: This only concerns  predict() at new points
	  when the formula contained things like poly() or ns() {in the RHS}.

Because I hadn't have time to fix this yet, I submit it.
[R version 1.5.1 and at least 1.4.1, probably all versions at all:]
For these, R 1.5.x does not differ from 1.4.1 : Inspite of R
1.5.0's "NEWS" entry and the ?Safepredict help page, 
predict() doesn't (always?) work correctly for (some cases of)
   predict(lm(y ~  poly(....)), newdata = .....)
or
   predict(lm(y ~  ns(....)),   newdata = .....)

Here is a simple (longer than necessary) example 

#### This modified from the last part of  example(cars) {of R 1.5.1}:

data(cars)
## An example of polynomial regression
## -- to show the bug, the linear example is sufficient
cars.1 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 1), data = cars)
cars1  <- lm(dist ~      speed,              data = cars)# the `same'
all.equal(predict(cars.1), predict(cars1))# the fitted values are ok

cars.4 <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree = 4), data = cars)
newd <- data.frame(speed = d <- seq(0, 25, length = 51)) # shorter than in ?cars

Right.

Well, Random is listed at several places, e.g. in the result of
 help.search("random")  : # ..., Random(base), ...
So, at least for me, it is confusing trying ?Random after that.

Agreed, but why not \name ?

As Martin pointed out, not only help.start() has this "bug"(?).

I think it is not a bad idea to get help with ?NAME , if NAME is listed
anywhere else ...

I think Kurt is already allowing that as confusing.

We need \name to hyperlink correctly. This came about originally because
of Windows file name restrictions, and later Kurt's example came up on
some MacOS variant.

Agreed, but my solution was to not use NAME anywhere else.  I don't have a
problem with the Java search, as clicking on the item works.

There is a side issue. Is `Random' a reasonable help topic?  Probably not
(ditto Binomial) but `random' probably is.

Subject: diagonals of tensors
Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.44.0207261153230.62952-100000@homer30.u.washington.edu>



 Is there a simple and efficient way of extract `diagonals' from arrays
(tensors)

That is, suppose  A is a 20x10x2 array, B is 10x5 and C is 20x5 I would
like the 2x5 matrix whose i,j entry is

      sum_k sum_l  A(k,l,i)B(l,j)C(k,j)


Using tensor() (or outer and matrix multiplication) it's easy to construct
the 2x5x5 matrix with i,j,J entry

       sum_k sum_l  A(k,l,i)B(l,j)C(k,J)

[eg tensor(tensor(A,B,2,1),C,1,1) ]
and I'm looking for the j==J `diagonal', ideally without constructing the
whole thing.

I've met similar problems, independently.
The bug tracking list does not tell that is already done.

I've attached a patch file and the modified read.table.R.
Hope it helps. However, it is not intensively tested.

Cheers,
Martin

[Forwarded to r-bugs, since the docs say that f can be a list in all
the split-related functions]

Thanks for pointing this out. I think your code should work, although
I'm slightly uneasy about actually modifying f, so how about

        len <- length(if (is.list(f)) f[[1]] else f)
        x <- vector(mode = typeof(value[[1]]), length = len)

?

By the way, I see that split.default starts with 

    if (is.list(f)) 
        f <- factor(do.call("interaction", f))

What is the reason (if any) why this cannot just be f <-
interaction(f) ? If there is one, then it is likely that you would
have to do the same in unsplit.

Calling with separate factors is what is actually documented for
interaction.  The code for interaction shows that passing the arguments as
a list also works, and has since Dec 98.  I'll alter interaction.Rd.

Just curious, why are you uneasy about that? Does it have side effects?

The reason I used the interaction() call is that this seems to work too:

 > split(1:10,list(a=1:2,b=1:5))

So, lists with unequal lengths.

It is largely due superstition, but if you change f before calling
split<-() you have split() and split<-() called with different f's
even if the same f is used for split() and unsplit(). That can be
quite OK, but there's a marginal risk that it causes an inconsistency
somewhere so that the split and unsplit aren't exact inverses.

OK, I understand. Thanks for explaining.

You're right, it doesn't work. I was a bit blinded by the fact that

split(1:10,list(a=1:2,b=1:2))

did what I expected, although I now understand that I should not rely on 
these results. Should have payed more attention to the help pages and 
the warnings.

Subject: R Code for X-Tab with Row/Col Proportions, Expected Vals and Tests
Message-ID: <006601c23685$b499e510$0201a8c0@MARC>


Recently, I noted a post and replies on R-Help from Professor Marc
Feldesman regarding a cross tabulation function that generates row and
column proportions, marginal values, expected cell values and tests for
independence presumably similar in a fashion to the output of the S-Plus
crosstabs() function or SAS Proc Freq.

Martin Maechler had posted some code in reply for folks to update and
translate.  

In parallel, out of my own needs for something functionally similar, I
have been working for a while on a function that takes either a
two-dimensional matrix or two vectors and generates just such a table,
with output similar to the aforementioned S-Plus/SAS functions.  Column
widths are adjusted based upon the dimnames and the digits argument and
the printed table is labeled with vector names if used.

The code for the function is below.  If anyone wishes me to e-mail a
text file containing the code, let me know.

My goal would be to make this available to the R community as open
source, either independently or perhaps if deemed appropriate, as a base
function.

I would appreciate any constructive criticism of the code itself or the
output. My guess is that there may be more efficient means of performing
some of the manipulations and/or perhaps being consistent with core R
coding and output standards.

If there are any suggestions for improvement, I would be more than happy
to incorporate these and make them available to the community.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to any feedback.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

Recently, I noted a post and replies on R-Help from Professor Marc
Feldesman regarding a cross tabulation function that generates row and
column proportions, marginal values, expected cell values and tests for
independence presumably similar in a fashion to the output of the S-Plus
crosstabs() function or the SAS Proc Freq.

Martin Maechler had posted some code in reply for folks to update and
translate.

In parallel, out of my own needs for something functionally similar, I
have been working for a while on a function that takes either a
two-dimensional matrix or two vectors and generates just such a table,
with output similar to the aforementioned S-Plus/SAS functions.  The
code for the function is attached.

My goal would be to make this available to the R community as open
source, either independently or perhaps if deemed appropriate, as a base
function.

I would appreciate any constructive criticism of the code itself or the
output. My guess is that there may be more efficient means of performing
some of the manipulations and/or perhaps being consistent with R coding
and output standards.

If there are any suggestions for improvement, I would be more than happy
to incorporate these and make them available to the community.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to any feedback.

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

The function quantile, in base, sometimes gives incorrect results
and is unnecessarily complicated.  For example,

> x <- c(-Inf, -Inf, Inf, Inf)
> quantile(x)
  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
-Inf -Inf -Inf  Inf  Inf

The correct result is
 0%  25%  50%  75%  100%
-Inf -Inf    NaN    Inf     Inf

Here the calculation at probs = 0.5 is
    50% quantile = x[2] + 0.5 * (x[3] - x[2])
                       = -Inf + 0.5 * (Inf - (-Inf))
                       = -Inf + Inf
                       = NaN

The responsible code is:

n <- length(x)
np <- length(probs)
if(n > 0 && np > 0) {
index <- 1 + (n - 1) * probs
lo <- floor(index)
hi <- ceiling(index)
x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))
i <- index > lo
qs <- x[lo]
    i <- seq(along=i)[i & !is.na(i)][qs[i] > -Inf]
    .minus <- function(x,y) ifelse(x == y, 0, x - y)# ok for Inf - Inf
    qs[i] <- qs[i] + .minus(x[hi[i]], x[lo[i]]) * (index[i] - lo[i])
}

I suggest:

n <- length(x)
np <- length(probs)
If(n > 0 && np > 0){
    index <- 1 + (n - 1) * probs
    lo <- pmin(floor(index), n - 1)
    hi <- lo + 1
    x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))
    qs <- x[lo]
    dif <- ifelse(x[hi] != qs, x[hi] - qs, 0) # Avoid Inf-Inf NaN.
    qs <- ifelse((fac <- location - k) != 0, qs + fac * dif, qs)
}

Subject: Optim() returns wrong maximum
Message-ID: <3D466034.ED2C7EFF@lancs.ac.uk>

Dear R-devel

During the last half a year I have several times encountered the
following problem with optim() when using method= "L-BFGS-B". 

The function return a value which is clearly not the maximum (seen from
printing the value each time the function is called). Some output is
shown below.

A few things I have observed (as I remember it):

a. The problem seems to occur when the last function call is for a value
on the boundary.

b. The problem also seems to occur more frequently in cases where the
function providing the gradient is mis-specified.


I have deliberately not provided code such that you can reproduce the
behaviour. The reason being that these functions are complicated  and
involves a lot of input (data, fixed parameters, etc).


Someone might spot the problem based on the information I have given
(possibly a bug in optim() ?).
In case not, I would like to ask if anyone has observed similar problems
?. 
This may help me to construct a more simple example, which I could then
submit with reproducible code.

Hi Ole,

I have encountered similar problems.
Even more, the parameters are not always 
within the given bounds (for method= "L-BFGS-B")
The values are then only an epsilon outside,
but it can be very disturbing nonetheless.

Cheers,
Martin

PS: the MLE algorithm in my contributed package 
    `RandomFields' is written such that it
    gets around with these two problems of optim

Hello,

 I think the best option isd the one proposed by Mr. Ripley. We have added
some C and the package compiles fine on Sun machines, and it should do
on other Big Endian machines.

 Thanks to all for your comments,

Subject: Unable to install new package using local zip file (PR#1854)
Message-ID: <200207302124.XAA14249@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jagadish Rangrej
Version: 1.5.1
OS: windows 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (192.139.231.5)


I have produced one package using 
>Rcmd install pubbias (pubbias is the name of pkg),
to move it to any new computer, I take the zip file of, "Program
file\R\rw1051\library\pubbias" and install it using menu option in R for
installing from local zip files.

It gives the error : "error -1 in extracting from zip file"

solved :
before installing using menu option, go to "program files\R\rw1051\library" and
make a directory "pubbias", then install the package from the local zip file
option.

Thanks,
-Jag

There is nothing here that we could reproduce.

The option does work: download any of the zip files on CRAN and try it.
(Indeed, the same code is used by the option to install from CRAN, and we
have had no reports of problems.)

Two possible issues spring to mind:

1) the zip file might have invalid internal structure.  Maybe it is
missing the directory `pubbias' (although the unzip code should cope with
that, and that's not the error code I would expect).

2) This is not the first attempt to do something like this, and Windows
had the location in use.  (I have seen that one, and after a reboot it
worked cleanly.)
