Subject: [Rd] write_PACKAGES's fields default
Message-ID: <CAN+W6_uyiPFrxZY+1jpZfWr2OuyB8GjZWGasyKe3-0=Uj2R3iQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm trying to get some details from repositories with
available.packages. However, despite being included on the DESCRIPTION
files they are not available.

ap <- utils::available.packages(fields = "Additional_repositories",
    filters = c("CRAN", "duplicates"),
    ignore_repo_cache =  TRUE,
    repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
ap[, "Additional_repositories"] |> is.na() |> all()
## [1] TRUE

However, some packages like Seurat have the Additional_repositories
field [2]. If I try with another repository (Bioconductor software
repository):

ap <- available.packages(fields = "biocViews",
    ignore_repo_cache =  TRUE,
    repos = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/bioc")
ap[, "biocViews"] |> is.na() |> all()
## [1] TRUE

It also misses the BiocViews field compulsory on that repository.
Both repositories use tools::write_PACKAGES [3][4] to generate the
file read by available.packages. This function writes by default
fields "needed by available.packages".

However, it is unclear what is needed for available.packages.
According to its documentation, it returns "details corresponding to
packages currently available at one or more repositories". To me this
would mean that fields on the DESCRIPTION files should appear, but the
default of write_PACKAGES doesn't write other fields besides
'"Package"', '"Version"', '"Priority"',  '"Depends"', '"Imports"',
'"LinkingTo"', '"Suggests"', '"Enhances"', '"OS_type"', '"License"'
and '"Archs"'.

I could approach each repository and ask to include more fields.
However, to match the documentation on available.packages and help all
repository administrators it would make sense to change the default on
write_PACKAGES.
Could the default fields be changed, so
that all fields available on packages' DESCRIPTION to
PACKAGES(.gz,.rds). Perhaps with fields = TRUE?
If this is too much it would be great if fields documented by Writing
R Extensions are written on PACKAGES.
This modification would make it easier for all to reuse repository data.

Many thanks for your consideration,

Llu?s

PD: From CRAN perspective CRAN_packages_db() function can be used to
get Additional_repositories, but this is limited to CRAN and won't
work for BiocViews on Bioconductor or for other arbitrary fields like
'"RoxygenNote"'.

Hello everyone!

I'm Mossa, I'm one of the maintainers of extendr, an automated generation of bindings project for
Rust code, for use in R-packages.

I'm writing to you, as R 4.4.3 was just released, and there have not been
follow-up on an issue important to us. Link to the issue as discussed on r-devel
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2024-October/083666.html

A community member has provided a suggestion to a patch here https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/182, and we have also attempted to bring it up on
Bugzilla: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18806

TLDR: Default `R CMD check` uses additional CRAN-specific checks for Rust,
instead of keeping this behind the --as-cran flag.

I would like to say, that there is a growing interest in Rust within the R community.
And generally, Rust becoming a widely adopted language within the Python community (including the scientific part of that community). It is time to deal with the
pain points with using Rust in R.

Therefore, I would kindly ask that we have a dialogue on how to remedy the issue above first, and how we may deal with other issues going forward. There are both challenges embedded in R itself, and the current CRAN policy for Rust is prohibitive.

Mossa,

the issue you cite is lacking any pertinent information and it's not even clear why it should be an issue. The check is perfectly justified, it just reports whether a package using rust declares this correctly and where it downloads 3rd party content - something that is important to R users in general and not related to CRAN. I don't see how any of this is "prohibitive" it just calls out what the package is already doing.

As discussed before, my hope was that the "R"ust community will mature enough to work on proper support. It is not clear that it happened yet, but once it does it would make sense to talk about support just as we have for C, C++ and Java, so certainly that should be the right discussion. However, it will have to start with some thinking and a proposal on how the associated issues (compiler support, versioning, dependency sources etc.) are to be addressed, as opposed to making random demands. All this has nothing to do with CRAN so the issue you mention seems irrelevant to the progress. Also I'd like to know what are the "challenges embedded in R itself".

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon Urbanek,

There has been very little engagement with the issue I referred to. If it was decided that this ?check? ought to be part of the default checks for R,
then that could have been written to us. Either on the bugs.r-project.org or the proposed patch. Before we talk about anything else,
it does seem very strange that we cannot get a reasonable dialogue going.

I would like to say that the R/Rust community has grown substantially. From my end, there are 3 bindings project, extendr, savvy, and roxido.
Then, there are now many rust-based packages on CRAN, see this most recent compiled list https://github.com/nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs.
There is also proof-of-concept https://github.com/r-rust/hellorust that integrates `cargo`, rust?s official build system, with R?s package build system,
and https://github.com/extendr/hellorustc, which showcases how Rust compiler could be directly linked with R?s package system.

 Let me say, that the current R CMD check is not meant to be ?helpful?. When a package is built, `cargo` tells the user ?Downloading crates?.
Thus, this information is already conveyed to the user.

Personally, I do wish we could debate this requirement further. I do not believe that having R-packages on CRAN vendor rust dependencies
as a good policy. Download statistics is a success metric of a given r-package and rust packages. By insisting on vendoring, and thus
side-stepping `cargo` / crates.io, we are robbing upstream authors of their download-numbers. I do not think such policy is honourable.

While C/C++ do not have official package repositories, it could be thought of, as fair game, to have CRAN act as a pseudo package manager for C/C++ libraries.
I?m not going to argue for or against this part.

There are many objections from the CRAN side to all things related to Rust. I don?t want to open multiple topics in the same thread.
But there is plenty to bring up. And I had hoped we could talk this little issue through, before embarking on a larger discussion.
I do not appreciate the ?random demands? comment, as this is not a demand, nor is it random.
I have inquired my end of the community for suggestions
to compile a larger proposal, but then I was afraid that this would be perceived as a big, bulky demand.

Rust is not C/C++/Java, and the support for Rust cannot look like the support for these languages.

You seem to be taking a confontational tone, which isn't likely to 
encourage a reasonable dialogue.

I've looked for other messages on this, and didn't see any besides this 
one explaining why including check_rust() in the checks is a problem. 
The problem you talk about here is that it encourages vendoring, which 
makes it harder for package authors to count downloads.

To be honest, that doesn't seem like a very serious problem.  I assume 
the packages ("crates") we are talking about are open source, so this is 
entirely in the spirit of how they are allowed to be distributed.

If they aren't open source, then users of those packages should be 
warned about that, and a check failure is a good way to do that.

So you need to explain why it is important to be able to download and 
install software and not be warned about it.

I am not in R Core or CRAN, but I can suggest why it is better to 
include source in the package:  it makes the use of that package more 
reliable in the future.  It's not uncommon to run an R computation that 
was written a few years ago.  Sometimes libraries or R have changed, and 
a user will need to go back to a previous version to reproduce the 
calculation.  Being able to able to rebuild a system as it would have 
been back then is important.

Is that possible if the package needs to make a download?  The download 
site that worked a few years ago may no longer exist.  If the site 
exists, the code versions there may be different.

Those are some of the issues that Simon was alluding to.

Duncan Murdoch

I agree with you. It seems no one explained what problem it causes to them.
In my understanding (disclaimer: I haven't hit this by myself yet), the
problem is that the "Downloading crates ..." log raises a warning, which
makes the CI check fail. Although it's true that none of this is
"prohibitive," it's just inconvenient.

Maybe it's possible to make it a NOTE instead of a WARNING at least?

I'm suggesting so because otherwise this will end up encouraging the
package authors to hide these logs as a workaround to avoid the CI failure.
As it's very easy, I'm personally fine with the status quo, but if it
becomes a common practice, it makes it harder for the CRAN maintainers to
investigate the installation logs.

Best,
Yutani

Well this has surely veered off course!

As the one who filed the BugZilla report, I'd like to redirect the
conversation and provide further context.

The question should be *"how do we get a dialogue started on this bugzilla
issue before the next minor *
*release of R?"*

The current check for Rust-based R package's downloading external
dependencies works by looking at
the output logs for the presence of  "Downloading crates." This can is an
entirely fine requirement for
CRAN?however, due to the fact that it is an error, packages distributed
through other repositories
fail the R-CMD check.

Folks who use R-universe or PPM or some mysterious third thing may not
share the same philosophy as
CRAN and prefer the convenience of fetching the dependencies at compile
time and not vendoring them.

An alternative would be for the check to be optionally skipped or become a
NOTE when the CRAN
flag is not set and an ERROR otherwise. Skipping this CRAN check is as easy
as adding `--quiet`
or setting an environment variable?but that is against the spirit of the
check.

Ideally, the check can remain, but scoped appropriately.

Isn't this exactly that dialogue?

I think you misunderstood me.  CRAN shares the view I gave that you 
should be able to run old code to reproduce old results, but they aren't 
the only ones.  That's always been a goal of R.

If it is that easy to skip the check, then I really don't see the issue. 
  Just ask the repository where you want to put your package to put that 
option or environment variable in place, and there's no longer a problem.

  I, like Duncan, am just following along here. I think there might be 
two distinct questions which it would be useful to keep distinct:

  * how to silence the rust-check if desired?

   rather than debating whether the rust-check should be always-on, 
on-for-CRAN-only, etc., would it provide for useful flexibility to add 
an environment variable that enables/disables this functionality?  There 
are already 168 of these environment variables, how much would one more 
cost?

   I'm not sure how adding an environment variable to allow easier 
user/alternate-repository control of the check is "against the spirit of 
the check" ...

   All the existing check-regulating env variables ...

cd src/library/tools/R
grep 'Sys.getenv("_R_CHECK' * | sed -e 's/^.*Sys.getenv(//' | sed -e 
's/[,)].*//' | sort | uniq | wc


   * should CRAN allow Rust crates to be downloaded?

   This is a much more fundamental policy decision, which I have no 
opinion about.

   cheers
    Ben Bolker

I may have misunderstood Josiah.  I thought his message said that it is 
already easy to silence the check, by stopping the code from issuing the 
message the check is looking for.

Presumably the package shouldn't do that, but if there's an environment 
variable that can be set to do it, then the repository or user can 
choose to do it, so there's no need for R to add another environment 
variable.

BTW, as far as I can see current R-devel doesn't issue an error, it just 
issues warnings about two issues:

  - the package is downloading crates
  - the rustc compiler doesn't report a version number

I don't see anything from you on this list - your first engagement was yesterday. I have no idea what you refer to as "us" and what makes you think you should have been notified if no one heard from you before. A start of any engagement is to start communication, so here we are, perhaps not the most fortunate way to start off, but we have a discussion and there is hope.

Then, there are now many rust-based packages on CRAN, see this most recent compiled list https://github.com/nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs.

I think this part of the problem - there is no systematic rust support, so each package author does something differently. As much as it is nice to have the freedom to have many different implementation of the same thing, I would argue that in cases like language support it makes more sense to combine the effort into one solution (after everyone experimented and gained enough experience) that is easy to manage and is well maintained. This is what happened to most mature languages such as C++, Java and Python. That would avoid the "hacks" in place today (I'm referring to the check).

You are jumping issues here: as I said before this has nothing to do with CRAN. So let us first take CRAN out of the picture and talk about the check. The check does two things: a) it checks that the package correctly declares rust dependency and  b) checks whether the package uses 3rd party dynamic downloads. Since the "R"ust community has yet to come up with any systematic rust support, both seem very reasonable checks. We want to know if a package requires rust by checking the DESCRIPTION file alone so the user can make an informed decision whether they want (or even can) use the package. It is also important to know if a package can accesses 3rd party resources online. Due to rising security threats it is increasingly common to not allow analytics machines to have access to the Internet so sensitive data cannot be leaked. It also opens the can of legality as the resulting software may not adhere to the license of the package and there is no guarantee that the user will still have the license. Moreover, reproducibility is very important to R users so it should be possible to reproduce the installation - which excludes 3rd party distributed systems which don't have any such guarantees unless they provide a way to fully vendor dependencies. So, in short, there are many reasons why the user should know about the things checked so they can make informed decisions. Whether this is the best way to signal that is up for debate.

Your argument is that the important reason is a popularity contest based on download statistics. I would argue that it is a very weak reason, since vast majority of R users does not use source installations to install packages, so there is no "robbing" of upstream authors - the statistics don't reflect real usage anyway.

If you want to propose improvements to the check, I'm sure it would be appreciated, but putting it behind --as-cran doesn't seem the right approach nor does that solve the problem in any way as the issues are not CRAN-specifc. I would think that some proposal to declare rust requirements (incl. toolchain) and have declared a way to vendor dependencies to address off-line install, licensing and security issues uniformly for rust packages would be steps in the right direction.

Why not? They all require compilers, ways to deal with dependencies and produce binaries - so does Rust. It's just one of many similar languages. The key is to have proper support instead of having each package deal with the complexities alone.

Simon

Unfortunately your test generates a false positive for httr2 (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_httr2.html) and other
tidyverse packages where we use the base pipe in examples, but carefully
disable them for older versions of R.

For exemple,? in one of reported files 'iterate_with_offset.Rd' ( 
https://github.com/r-lib/httr2/blob/main/man/iterate_with_offset.Rd ), 
we can see :

\examples{
req <- request(example_url()) |>
 ? req_url_path("/iris") |>
 ? req_throttle(10) |>
 ? req_url_query(limit = 50)
...

the pipe '|>' is well used but I didn't find any check for R version 
prior to 4.1. May be it is done elsewhere?

Best,
Serguei.

Yes: look at the configure script + tools/examples.R

We automatically test all tidyverse packages with the last four versions of
R, and you can see that all checks are fine with R 4.0.5 at (e.g.)

Please accept my apologies. Indeed, the script [1] called at
configuration time does replace the examples section to avoid parse
errors for example(...). And having example() do nothing (with all code
and an explanation in the help page) is a small cost for having the
rest of the package work on R versions as old as 3.5.

I don't see a way to take this into account, since the workaround is
completely invisible to sufficiently new versions of R. It might be
that the best way forward is to revert the Rd example check.

Currently, we have 146 CRAN packages for which the check code finds 4.1
or later syntax additions in the Rd file examples only.  

Ivan kindly tried the effect of checking these with 4.0 (thanks again: I
cannot "easily" do this as Debian testing has libcurl 8 and the 4.0
configure code insists on libcurl 7).  This had 140 packages fail with
parse errors, 3 more for other reasons, and packages

  gmailr httr2 purrr

still pass as using the configure plus tools/examples.R renewcommand for
\examples trick.

So in c87900 I just committed I have simply stoplisted these three in
the check code, and the false positive NOTEs for these should be gone
when this gets picked up.

Thanks for spotting and helping to fix :-)

Subject: [Rd] R-devel (87913) compilation fails at "make vignettes";
 R-4-4 completes and fails "make check"
Message-ID: <CAL6gwnKvncaoD_GSniDQ7jf3VjbbUEcPE+J8EqdbZ92wkuK7FQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I recently built a new computer and I am now using Windows 11. When
building a distribution of R-devel from source using the most recent
Rtools44, the build consistently fails at the point it is supposed to
build the vignettes from base with the message below. R-4-4-branch
(also 87913) completes without error but fails "make check".

R-devel Error:
```
* DONE (mgcv)
building/updating vignettes for package 'grid' ...
processing 'displaylist.Rnw'
make[2]: *** [Makefile.win:99: vignettes] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Makefile:345: vignettes] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:395: distribution] Error 2
```
Looking at Makefile.win in .src/library at line 99 shows:

```
vignettes:
@for pkg in grid parallel utils stats; do \
    $(ECHO) "building/updating vignettes for package '$${pkg}' ..."; \
    ($(ECHO) "tools:::.install_package_vignettes(\"$(srcdir)/$${pkg}\",
\"$(top_builddir)/library/$${pkg}\")") | \

  R_LIBS_USER=NULL R_LIBS_SITE=NULL \
          $(R_EXE) > /dev/null || exit 1; \
done
@rm -Rf .vignettes
```

While R-4-4 completes "make distribution" compilation, it fails make check with:

```

make[1]: *** [Makefile.common:193: test-all-basics] Error 1
make: *** [Makefile:333: check-devel] Error 2
```

Some initial research indicated that permission issues can interfere
with vignette building. I have set Rtools44 to run as an administrator
and I confirmed that my build directory and all its subdirectories are
allowed full control by the logged-in windows account.

The only major difference between these sets of runs and those over
the last decade is the chip (Ryzen 9800X3D), which for vignettes
should be irrelevant, and the operating system?Windows 11 Pro instead
of Windows 10 Home. I don't know which change from R-4-4 to R-devel
triggers the error or why R-4-4 completes and fails the check. I have
exhausted my limited knowledge as to how to address the issue. Any
ideas as to why this may be happening and what I could do would be
greatly appreciated.

For completeness:

The '|| exit 1' only exists since r87822: previously, failures from 
building the base vignettes would be missed.

This output diff from the example in ?tools::vignetteInfo shows that 
your R-4-4 installation indeed lacks base vignettes. Maybe pdflatex 
isn't installed or in the PATH on your new system?

There should be a file utils-Ex.Rout.fail (I think in tests/Examples/). 
What does it say about the error?

Hope this helps!

Thank you very much, Sebastian. Your suggestion about checking the
FAIL solved the problem. It reminded me that GCC 12+ has a bug
regarding AVX2 alignments on Windows, which manifests when calling
`agrep` or `adist`, the latter being precisely the point of failure in
the FAIL file. See this thread [1] and this post in particular [2] for
more detail. Restoring passing "-Wa,-muse-unaligned-vector-move" to
EOPTS and Makevars solved the problem and check-devel passes. Tomas is
going to be rightfully annoyed with me for forgetting!

Thank you again!!

I'd indeed use

Cpdb <- tools:::CRAN_package_db()
Bpdb <- tools:::BioC_package_db()

for the two mentioned repos. ALso, PACLAGES.... is downloaded very 
frequently and should not grow too much.

Is there a use case why available.packages() should provide this info 
while not being less performant for package installatons etc.?

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Subject: [Rd] S4: show() method for "MethodDefinition": show non-trivial
 generic
Message-ID: <26575.2779.682772.959686@stat.math.ethz.ch>

Context: We are working to add complex and integer (sparse and dense)
	 matrix classes to package Matrix.

I'm working with "Ops", notably "Arith" group methods in order
to ensure that all combinations of classes  and arithmetic,
comparison, etc operators work.
 { and yes, if you don't know anything about S4 or group methods
   (which also exist for S3 or S7) you may now press "delete message"
   and go on to something else ...

   In the other case, maybe browse ?S4groupGeneric in R or on the web
   https://rdrr.io/r/methods/S4groupGeneric.html  
 }

Debugging problems and testing, for me always involves lots of
showMethods(..) and selectMethod(..) calls such as, say,

 selectMethod("+", c("lgCMatrix", "nMatrix"))

For the current (CRAN) version of Matrix, this prints the method
definition, and then ends in

   ...............
   }
   <environment: namespace:Matrix>

   Signatures:
	   e1          e2       
   target  "lgCMatrix" "nMatrix"
   defined "lMatrix"   "nMatrix"
   >

I did only ask for the "+" method, but of course,
e.g., when looking where we got this implemented, it is interesting
to note if this is from a "+" or an "Arith" or even (most
generally), an "Ops" method definition.

Now, fortunately, the selectMethod() object *does* contain this
information in its `generic` slot, but the show() method does not show it.

I propose to look into fixing this situation, such that in cases
as this one, there would be one additional line of show() output
   ` Generic: "Ops" `
and it would show (not the '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' line I only added
here for visibility) :


   ...............
   }
   <environment: namespace:Matrix>

   Generic: "Ops"
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Signatures:
	   e1          e2       
   target  "lgCMatrix" "nMatrix"
   defined "lMatrix"   "nMatrix"
   >


Of course this may break people's "pipelines" if they rely on
exact reproduction of R's console (or *.Rout R batch) output.
Apart from that, I see really advantages here, and I don't expect
the net effect to be problematic.

It may affect  the many Bioconductor packages using S4, and I'm
particularly glad for feedback from "there".

With thanks in advance,
Martin

Dear Uwe,

I would like to outline three key reasons, in increasing order of
importance, for my proposal:

1) The current documentation does not fully reflect actual repository
practices. The available documentation suggests that
available.packages provides "details corresponding to packages
currently available at one or more repositories." However, in
practice, this function serves mostly one purpose: retrieving
information for installation. This dual purpose likely explains its
high frequency of use, but it does not align precisely with its
documented functionality.

2) The function already provides more fields than the mandatory
canonical ones outlined in the Writing R Extensions (WRE) manual:
'Package', 'Version', 'License', 'Description', 'Title', 'Author', and
'Maintainer' [1]. Expanding the available fields would benefit users,
package developers, and repository maintainers by offering greater
transparency and usability.

3) The absence of the 'Additional_repositories' field in the output
often forces users to resort to complex manual installations when
repository installations fail. Additionally, exposing the 'Packaged'
field could provide clarity about whether a package update was made by
the repository team or the original maintainer. Anticipating useful
fields is an ongoing challenge, adopting a flexible yet comprehensive
approach would better serve the community.

Regarding performance considerations, the available.packages output is
cached for one hour by default. While increasing this cache duration
might reduce repository demand, I have observed approximately 50
updates per day on CRAN (with significantly fewer on Bioconductor due
to synchronized releases). The frequency of updates has grown
alongside the number of packages on CRAN (up to 2022). Extending the
cache duration may reduce bandwidth usage, but it would also delay
users from accessing the latest package updates. The impact on the
server load and connection times remain unclear, particularly if the
file size increases.

To mitigate any performance slowdowns resulting from the addition of
new fields, I am considering providing a patch to optimize certain
steps in install.packages related to available.packages output.
Potential improvements include vectorizing package dependency
extraction and converting the output object to a matrix format before
comparisons. Additionally, the package_version function required to
compare versions seems slow too. There may be other opportunities for
speed and memory optimizations as well.

Concerning concerns about writing performance, the documentation on
update_PACKAGES indicates that the penalty for adding new fields would
be incurred once per field added. The impact at CRAN's scale or how it
scales with the number of fields and packages is unclear. Writing the
file with multiple new fields at once would be preferable to
incremental updates.

I initially proposed expanding and reusing existing functions. A
common alternative approach to providing this information would also
be appreciated. Other repositories have adopted different distribution
methods, as reflected in these private functions, and adding this
feature would not prevent using of those methods, but could raise them
to a canonical status on R itself.

I appreciate your time considering this.
Best,

Llu?s
