Hi,

Did you manage to get to a blog post at some point?

I just saw that there was an live-streaming lecture on August 4th - 
https://sms.wgtn.ac.nz/cgi-bin/seminars?rm=details&id=987

Was this perhaps recorded anywhere?

right, that could be improved. Do you have an example which exhibits the

Both R_check_class_etc and R_check_class_and_super are unfortunately 
exported, the former is used a lot in packages (even though they are not 
mentioned in Writing R Extensions, so actually shouldn't be used in 
packages). Anyway, it would be easier if we could preserve their 
interface and behavior.

Maybe we could support rho==NULL in R_check_class_and_super, the 
environment would be looked up in that case when needed. 
R_check_class_etc would simply only call R_check_class_and_super with 
that argument. I see that R_check_class_and_super uses asChar() on the 
class attribute, while R_check_class_etc does not currently for looking 
for the environment, but I assume doing that in both cases should not 
matter (and it would have to be tested).

So this would be a trivial change, but if you wanted to create a minimal 
patch, I will be happy to have a look.

Best
Tomas

I benchmarked .Call("R_etc", x) for x <- new("dgTMatrix"), after compiling
and loading the following:

```
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP R_etc(SEXP x) {
     static const char *valid[] = {"dgCMatrix", "dgRMatrix", "dgTMatrix", ""};
     return ScalarInteger(R_check_class_etc(x, valid));
}
```

R-devel used ~2 microseconds while my patched version of R used ~0.2
microseconds.  So, not a bottleneck by any means.  On the other hand,
'Matrix' and probably other packages do call R_check_class_etc() quite
often, hence my report.

I've implemented essentially what you've described; see attached.

Subject: [Rd] Passing a call as label to text() works differently when the
 call involves paste() vs paste0()
Message-ID: <d6a1ccfe0082445b8f74a32f1e511e48@UM-MAIL3214.unimaas.nl>

Hi all,

Maybe a bit of an esoteric observation, but the second one doesn't work properly:

x <- 2
plot(NA, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
text(0.5, 0.55, bquote(paste("x =", .(x))))
text(0.5, 0.45, bquote(paste0("x = ", .(x))))

Note that this has nothing to do in particular with bquote(). This is the same issue:

plot(NA, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
text(0.5, 0.55, as.call(list(quote(paste), "x =", 2)))
text(0.5, 0.45, as.call(list(quote(paste0), "x = ", 2)))

I had a look at C_text in plot.c, but couldn't figure out why the second one is treated differently.

Best,
Wolfgang

You're using plotmath code, which is documented in ?plotmath.

It doesn't execute paste(), it just uses that name for a similar 
operation.  There's no operation named paste0(), so that doesn't work.

The paste() operation doesn't add space, so it's more like paste0() in 
any case.

I see, ideally one would have a real scenario with a real performance 
issue leading to this. With a micro-benchmark, one could come up with 
pretty much arbitrary speedup, so it is harder to judge whether an 
optimization is actually worth the effort, the risk of introducing bugs 
and sometimes the added complexity.

Thanks, I've restored the original behavior with pkg == R_NilValue (note 
rho was R_GlobalEnv), I've used C NULL to mark the special mode when 
"rho" should be found, and I made some small tweaks. I will add after 
more testing, if the results are ok.

Yes.  I _was_ at first thinking about a less artificial example
(and in retrospect I probably should have led with that):

## install.packages("Matrix", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
library(Matrix)
n <- 10L
x <- new("dgeMatrix", Dim = c(n, n), x = as.double(seq_len(n^2)))
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(t(x))

where the 't' method calls the C-level unpackedMatrix_transpose(),
which in turn calls R_check_class_etc().

Makes sense - thanks for catching that.

Hi

When there are duplicated repos, available.packages() takes
significantly longer to run.

For example

mirror = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"
system.time(available.packages(repos = mirror))
#   user  system elapsed
# 1.054   0.031   1.245
system.time(available.packages(repos = c(mirror, mirror)))
#   user  system elapsed
# 22.389   0.037  22.429

Best wishes,

If you profile the second run, you will see that the majority of the time is spent in the `tools:::.remove_stale_dups` function, which loops over all duplicated packages - so all packages in that case.
One improvement I could think of is to replace the first line of that function
    pkgs <- ap[, "Package"]
with
    pkgs <- ap[!duplicated(ap[, c("Package", "Version")]), "Package"]
which would help in your example, but the function might still run longer if there are many packages with different versions present, so there maybe even better optimizations.

Stating the obvious here, but since we don't know your 'real' use case, adding a `unique` call to the `repos` argument of the `available.packages` would achieve a similar improvement without any modifications needed from `tools`.

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

The use case came from the rig application
(https://github.com/r-lib/rig). Rig (I think) inserts the RStudio
package manager into the list of repos. This can cause duplication in
repos, hence the current issue.
Now that I know the reason, I can work around it.

Thanks for reporting this issue.  I just changed available.packages() a
la

-    for(repos in contriburl) {
+    for(repos in unique(contriburl)) {

which avoids the full duplication.

Subject: [Rd] Should package version requirements assume installation from
 sources?
Message-ID: <b3e53fa9-b0e0-a8c8-147a-c1c56348f3e9@gmail.com>

[Arguably also appropriate for R-package-devel, but posted to R-devel
     as the discussion is aimed primarily at "experts" ... ]

We, the authors of Matrix, have encountered a somewhat subtle issue
induced by caching of S4 classes and methods in package namespaces.

The namespaces of three reverse dependent packages (SeuratObject, conText,
mcmcsae) cache the formal definition of our virtual class Matrix (and some
subclasses).  For example:

 > ns <- asNamespace("SeuratObject")
 > grep("^[.]__C__.*Matrix$", names(ns), value = TRUE)
[1] ".__C__dMatrix"       ".__C__compMatrix"    ".__C__AnyMatrix"
[4] ".__C__generalMatrix" ".__C__CsparseMatrix" ".__C__sparseMatrix"
[7] ".__C__dsparseMatrix" ".__C__Matrix"

The cached definition (which includes a _validity method_) is obtained from
the version of Matrix available when the reverse dependent package was built
from sources.  For example, if SeuratObject was built under Matrix 1.4-1,
then we get:

 > getValidity(ns$.__C__Matrix)
function (object)
{
     if (!isTRUE(r <- .Call(Dim_validate, object, "Matrix")))
         r
     else .Call(dimNames_validate, object)
}
<bytecode: 0x11e7ca508>
<environment: namespace:Matrix>

whereas if SeuratObject was built under Matrix >= 1.5-0, then we get:

 > getValidity(ns$.__C__Matrix)
function (object)
.Call(Matrix_validate, object)
<bytecode: 0x107dc1698>
<environment: namespace:Matrix>

There are two "questions" here:

1.  The symbol 'Matrix_validate' is not defined until Matrix 1.5-0.
     Is it necessary, for this reason alone, for SeuratObject to have
     'Imports: Matrix (>= 1.5-0)'?  Or can SeuratObject continue using
     'Imports: Matrix (>= 1.3-3)', at the risk of errors like

     > Error: object 'Matrix_validate' not found

     (as already seen here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73700130)?

     Note that this error would not occur for anyone installing SeuratObject
     from sources, unless they decide to _downgrade_ Matrix after doing so.
     Hence this primarily concerns Windows and macOS where R users would
     typically install a binary built by CRAN (i.e., not on their system).

     We are aware that package TMB tests in .onLoad() that the current Matrix
     version is equal to or greater than the version available at build time,
     thus avoiding a "strict" version requirement, but do not want this practice
     to spread ...

2.  For how long should Matrix retain the superceded 'Dim_validate' and
     'dimNames_validate', in order to ensure that "stale" cached validity
     methods continue to work?

We hope that this discussion will highlight the potential ramifications
of importing classes and methods from other packages, and having one's
classes and methods imported _by_ other packages, especially for version
requirements.

FWIW this happens all the time in Bioconductor, where S4 is used very 
intensively, when we make that kind of change to a core infrastructure 
package. Then a bunch of Windows and Mac binary packages need to be 
rebuilt because they contain cached stuff that is now out-of-sync with 
the new state of affairs. The way we deal with this is by bumping the 
version numbers of all the affected packages. This triggers automatic 
rebuilt and propagation of the new binaries.

Note that these problems also affect packages that were already 
installed on the user machines _prior_ to the changes to the upstream 
package. Because the caching we are talking about is actually in the 
package installation folder (and the fact that it ends up in the 
binaries is just a consequence of that). So even on a system where 
packages are installed from source, the affected packages need to be 
reinstalled. Bumping the version numbers of all the affected packages 
also solves that.

I don't see how this could be handled or mitigated via package requirements.

 Should package version requirements assume installation from
 sources?

   Interesting.

   How is the version number bumping communicated back to package 
maintainers? Or is there a rule like "third digit-blocks of package 
versions are reserved for Bioconductor modifications" ?

When you control the whole repo, and release it in batch, you can rebuild and

R uses a bunch of elements from the Debian package graph, namely

 Depends/Imports,
 Recommends,
 Suggests 
 Enhances (even if rarely used)

We may need to think about _the other direction_ via

 Breaks

where here, in Mikael's case, we could possibly say that Matrix: has a
Breaks: on the current (known, built with previous Matrix) packages
SeuratObject, conText, mcmcsae (each with a <= set to their current CRAN
version).  This would ensure that when Matrix updates, those packages also
update.

But it gets trickier because Debian can differentiate between an (upstream
source version), say, Matrix 1.5-1 _and its build versions_, say 1.5-1-1 so
the breakage would be of 1.5-1-1 but resolved by a new binary 1.5-1-2 which
sorts higher.  We don't have that, so maybe we cannot do the Breaks with
proper ordering. BioConductor can because of how it releases, CRAN cannot as
it does alter version numbers, only Maintainers do.

So maybe we need a few field in DESCRIPTION to tag 'RecommendedRebuilds'?
Or maybe CRAN would get a right to do an incremental release, so say 'my'
digest 0.6.29 would become 0.6.29.1 ?  But how to communicate this _in
general_ back to Maintainers?

Obviousy for binary packages we can cover this at the repo level, and CRAN
generally does but there are also 'from source' users out we should cover
here. So in short that is an open issue with no clear solution.

And all of this would of course require new and changed tooling.  As we often
maybe this too is something best tried first at package level via opt-in
alternatives to the functions in base package tools and utils.
