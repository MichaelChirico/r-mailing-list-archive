With me quickly getting there this morning ...

I had asked about multiple version (and also platform) support several
times during the past few years, and had always been told that this was
not necessary.  So why does this keep coming up?

One can add a version layer, but one has to do this right.  Patterning
after the Emacs model is wrong.  Binary incompatabilities were pointed
out, so

	PREFIX/lib/R/VERSION
	PREFIX/lib/R/site

is not good enough.  Emacs has added [the equivalent of]

	PREFIX/lib/R/site/VERSION

but that requires external control of version dependency at install
time.  We actually have the required info through the DESCRIPTION db,
hence could take care of this.

But the effort is really only worth it when one is interested in having
different versions installed at the same time.  Otherwise, you can
always do

	make install
	(cd PREFIX/lib; mv R R-VERSION)

yourself.

Developers, as PD says, typically rely on running their development
version from BUILDDIR.  Otoh, this is wrong because they could end up
with an incompatible add-on package in the site tree.  And we are back
to the long-made decision that God did not want us to run multiple R
versions at the same time.

The code you suggested adding is level-2 PostScript and does not work on
my office printer, for example.  So, yes, it would break things.  This is
why such code is the preserve of a Document Manager in the print spooling
system in Adobe's model.

R follows the recommendations of the PostScript Language Reference Manual
(Appendix G, to be precise).  Looks like StarOffice and GIMP *on your Linux
installation* do not.

Instinctively, I don't think we want to go there... Wouldn't one end
up with (the equivalent of)

> .lib.loc
[1] "/usr/local/lib/R-1.3.0/library"
[2] "/usr/local/lib/R-1.2.3/library"

Um, I did that once and the walls came tumblin' down... (Or rather, I
tried to move the existing install out of the way before installing a
new one.) You also need to fixup the R_HOME_DIR variable in the R
script as Beebe mentioned.

Er, how?

IF we drop the "easy package migration" aspect and just let people do
separate installs with separate generation of site libraries, would we
not be in the clear? There's also an issue with private libraries of
course. Versioning those would put some administrative burden on the
end user, but could we not adapt an "if it breaks, you get to keep
both pieces" policy?

In all other cases the $v component is a matrix. Also, the $u component

It's the famous `programmer bug' of not using  `` , drop = FALSE ''
when matrix subscripting in functions....

in the 2nd-to-last line of svd() :

    if(nv && nv < p) z$v <- z$v[, 1:nv, drop = FALSE]

				       add this.

I think "easy package migration"  is a great objective, but I expect it is a serious
constraint sometimes. In some respects, as a user, reliable is more important. It is
easier to expect that you always have to re-build packages then to expect you don't
need to and then get surprised sometimes.  There are whole operating systems
dedicated to showing that "easy" can be very difficult when it doesn't work.

Please keep in mind that the problems don't always come just with different R
versions. I'm currently using two systems (Solaris 5.6 and 5.8)  with a shared nfs
file system and I find that R built on 5.8 does not work on 5.6.

(Also, please keep in mind that R is not always installed by someone with root
priveleges.)

Subject: [Rd] formulas in variables in modeling functions
Message-ID: <OFC33AA95D.63C7CD15-ON85256A5E.004E396D@rtp.epa.gov>

I first noticed this in gnls, but it also happens in lm, so I suspect the
following phenomenon is universal in modeling functions.  Modify the
example from the lm help:

model <- as.formula(weight ~ group)
lm(model)

The result will be printed:

> lm(model)

Call:
lm(formula = model)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Coefficients:
(Intercept)     groupTrt
      5.032       -0.371

This is because in lm, (where the return value is z) z$call is set to cl,
and cl <- match.call().

My question is:  would it break things to add the line

cl[["formula"]] <- formula
after
cl <- match.call()
?

The result of this is:

> lm.new(model)

Call:
lm.new(formula = weight ~ group)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Coefficients:
(Intercept)     groupTrt
      5.032       -0.371

It would.  Think about how update() works.

What's wrong with

lm(weight ~ group)

or if you need it

eval(substitute(lm(model), model=model))

?  There is a difference between capturing the formula or using a
reference to a formula.

Are you sure we have the right info? We know if a package is
source-incompatible with old versions of R but we may not know if it is
binary-incompatible with new versions.  I was surprised to find that
survival seems to be binary-incompatible between 1.2.3 and 1.3.0 -- at
least, several bugs went away when I recompiled with pre1.3.0

Subject: [Rd] R-1.2.3 OSF precompiled binary doesn't run under DU4.0D (PR#964)
Message-ID: <200106011547.RAA03073@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Paul Mather
Version: 1.2.3
OS: Digital Unix 4.0D
Submission from: (NULL) (128.173.35.237)


The precompiled binary for "osf4.0" distributed via CRAN does not run under
Digital Unix 4.0.  The error given is:

Fatal error: The X11 shared library could not be loaded.
  The error was dlopen: cannot load /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R_X11.so

Subsequent investigation actually reveals that the R_X11.so was linked against
libdnet.so, which is not present on standard Digital Unix 4.0D systems.  The
error is triggered by an inability to load the libdnet.so shared library.

As I understand it, libdnet provides DECnet support.  Digital Unix 4.0D systems
ship with libdnet_stub.so, which is a library of empty stub functions.

Is it possible to provide a version of R_X11.so linked against libdnet_stub.so?
Aside from this problem, the precompiled binary appears to work (i.e.,
"R -g none" runs).

Cheers,

Paul.

Subject: [Rd] Unified naming for R<system>_tmpnam possible?
Message-ID: <3b17e6bf.thoffman.zappa@zappa.sax.de>

What is the reason that the system specific files (sys-unix.c et.al.) all define a specific
name for building tmpfile?

In main/devPS.c then there is an #ifdef sequence which calls depending on the
system defined the respective function.

Wouldn't it be better just to have one function R_tmpnam(), which is implemented
system dependent in the sys-<system>.c files?

Subject: [Rd] What is the logic behind sys-common, sys-unix et.al. ?
Message-ID: <3b17f4a4.thoffman.zappa@zappa.sax.de>

I try to understand how the system specifics are organised in R.

My understanding was that (citing system.txt):

 *	sys-common.c  has code common to the unix/gnome/gnuwin32 ports
 *	sys-unix.c    has code common to the unix/gnome ports
 *	system.c      has interface-specific code

But now I see that unix/sys-common contains unix and Win32 specific code which is selected via
#ifdefs. 

Another question is who carries the sys-common file? If it is "common", why does a specific
system subdir (unix, that is) carry this file? 

I know that there are historical reasons for that, but is there a "plan" for reorganising this stuff, now 
that there is at least a third class of systems (macintosh) involved?

Another question is: Should the graphics interfaces be connected to the systems in a 1:1 fashion?
I have a test build of R-1.2.3 for OS/2 an my hard disk which is able to use a Presentation Manager
and a X11 graphics device: X11 is a 1:1 copy of the unix/X11 files. (And I assume "that new Macs" I
do not know anything about can display X11, too. And for Win32 exist X11 servers ...)

Yes, now there is a Macintosh maintainer that had occurred to some of us.

However, as this is not part of the R API, I don't see this is of any
interest except to R-core, and changing things that work is not a high
priority.

We do not support X11 on Windows, even though it can be built.

No need to give up so quickly!

First, there could be an option for postscript level in the PS driver.  Adobe
acrobat reader, staroffice, etc. have an option like this, where you can
select level 1, 2, 3.  People who have a level 1 printer, could just select
level 1 output.

Secondly, you can use a "protected" setpagedevice call that will work on both
level 1 and level 2 printers.  It looks something like this:

/setpagedevice where { pop << /param value ...  >> setpagedevice } if

The 'where' command will return false if setpagedevice isn't defined, and thus
it setpagedevice will never get called.

It's not just those programs.  Lots of applications will output setpagedevice
commands to control paper size, duplex, etc.  It's usually the ones with more
comprehensive postscript support, that have these features.

I've never seen such a program on Solaris, which comes with a conformant
Document Manager as part of its spool system.

That other programs choose to take over the role of Document Manager is
no reason for R to do so.    These cludges are common in the Windows world,
and it is probably no coincidence that the programs you mention are
all versions of of copies of Windows programs.

Have you checked Sun's star office under solaris?  I just checked framemaker
under solaris, and it does output paper size commands.  But I gather that this
doesn't really matter to you.

Thankfully R is open source, so I will just add it myself.  You're solaris has
a document manager, so screw you attitude isn't very helpfull.  Just one more
patch I will have to apply to new versions.

Dear package author,

We are still accepting submissions for the second issue of the R
Newsletter.  For more information see

      http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/

If you are the author of a package on CRAN and you would like to promote
it a little bit, or if you simply have an interesting application using
R, we hope you can find some time to write a short article on it.  We
suggest that it be approximately 2 pages or less.  The idea of the
newsletter is that it be interesting to R users without being too
technical.  For example an article describing a package could begin by
briefly outlining the statistical background and go on to demonstrate
the usage on some typical data set.  Of course graphics are more than
welcome!

Bill Venables is also encouraging submissions to the more specialist
Programmer's Niche column.  In this case the technical level could be a
little higher, of course, but not necessarily: ingeniousness is the key.

Instructions for authors can be found in ``Writing Articles for R News''
in the first issue of Rnews; more detailed instructions will shortly be
available on the web page.  Remember that submissions have to be in
LaTeX, and that graphics are preferred in PDF or EPS format.  (Bitmaps
like JPG are also OK but please keep in mind that those cannot be scaled
easily and hence might look ugly in the final version.)

The deadline for submissions is

	 June 13, 2001

Keep the contributions rolling in!

For the Editorial Board,

Hi!

I just used the following command on our NT-Server:

  update.packages()
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : parse error

The problem is caused by the package gregmisc:

  x <- CRAN.packages()
  x[which(x == "gregmisc"),]

   Package    Version   Priority     Bundle    Depends 
"gregmisc"    "0.1.3"       "NA"       "NA"       "R " 


The error occurs in the line

  z[k] <- eval(parse(text = comptext))

in package.dependencies(), because in this case is:

  comptext
[1] "\"1.2.3\"  \"R \""


Best regards,

Subject: [Rd] update.packages() and parse(text="A B") (PR#966)
Message-ID: <200106031448.QAA08070@pubhealth.ku.dk>

This is a known problem with gregmisc already reported to maintainer and
fixed on my server (so it will propagate to CRAN shortly).  An update
to gregmisc is promised shortly.

Something similar happens on Unix (which is where I spotted it).  I
think you need to REMOVE gregmisc to fix it.

Yes.  What a nightmare.

[We potentially have control over this, though, through the Depends info
in the package DESCRIPTION dbs.  E.g., update.packages() could try to
organize packages with R version dependencies into version-dependent
subdirs.  But again: suppose pkg A depends on R version B and package B
which may be available but need another version of R.  So we may need
the version of package B for the same version of R etc etc ...]

I think we are much better off with the current `always take the most
current one' approach.

Of course.  But then how do you invoke R?  You either follow Emacs and
have

	R-1.2.3
	R-1.3.0

in your PATH somewhere, or you have a command line option for setting
the version.  And then we're back to the above, worrying about (mostly
binary but not necessarily so; what if there is a change in the
documentation system?) version dependencies in your site tree.

See above.  You're saying `tell everyone that they can do FOO to get
multiple version trees but then they're on their own'.  And then we get
all kinds of bug reports ...

Well ... at greatest generality one could support multiple versions of R
for multiple platforms in the same tree.  E.g., via

	R_HOME/VERSION/share
	R_HOME/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM
	R_HOME/VERSION/library/PKG/R
	R_HOME/VERSION/library/PKG/libs/PLATFORM

etc etc.  Again, long time ago it was decided not to have this.  

> (Also, please keep in mind that R is not always installed by someone

Right.  But the above could be applied to all library trees, at least.

Interesting.  I thought this would not be the case.  What you say is
that a package may claim it only needs R 1.2.2 but this might not run
under R 1.3.0 if compiled under R 1.2.2?

But version incompatibilities go beyond binary incompatibilties.  So
even if we have the info I am not sure what to do.

Hmm... nlme stopped working for me somewhere in the 1.2.2-patched
series. I'm not altogether sure why, but I might have recompiled R to
use ATLAS somewhere along the road. Not that there's any reason to try
and figure out exactly what happened, but it reminded me that things
like compiler and library setup might also be changed between
versions.

Good point.  A reconfigured system might very well break things ...

Subject: [Rd] boxplot.stats() returns wrong value for n (PR#967)
Message-ID: <200106041729.TAA11328@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Gregory R. Warnes
Version: R 1.2.3
OS: Linux (debian test)
Submission from: (NULL) (192.77.198.200)



The documentation for boxplot.stats() states that the 
element "n" of the return list is "the number of of 
non-`NA' observations in the sample.".  However, 
boxplot.stats() currently returns the total number 
of observations instead. 

Example:

> boxplot.stats( c(1:10,rep(NA,10) ) )

$stats
[1]  1.0  3.0  5.5  8.0 10.0

$n
[1] 20

$conf
[1] 3.733506 7.266494

$out
numeric(0)

The problem is the statement 

  n <- length(nna) # including +/- Inf

in boxplot.stats().  It should be

  n <- sum(nna) # including +/- Inf

Correcting this line yields:

> boxplot.stats( c(1:10,rep(NA,10) ) )
$stats
[1]  1.0  3.0  5.5  8.0 10.0

$n
[1] 10

$conf
[1] 3.001801 7.998199

$out
numeric(0)

Dear R,

I would like to report what I think is a bug in R.  I am running R
within emacs on a Digital AlphaStation.  See the version information
at the end of my R session for details.  I also attach a copy of the
file that is read in the `read.table' command.

Here's my R session, with a few comments added in to show what I
think is wrong:

You could very well be tickling a memory bug, but that version of R is
more than a year out of date and things have changed considerably in
the meantime. Could you please retry with a more recent version? 

And, BTW, large attachments are quite difficult to extract once they
have been mangled by the mailing list and bug filing software, so only
use them as a last resort. It's much preferable if you put it up
separately on your homepage or FTP site.

Subject: [Rd] error in make install-info (PR#969)
Message-ID: <200106051743.TAA16230@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi 
I'm installing R with the standard commands:

        ./configure
        make
	make check 
        make dvi        to create DVI versions
        make pdf        to create PDF versions
        make info       to create info files
 
        make install
        make install-dvi
        make install-info
        make install-pdf
     
Everything works fine apart from "make install-info":

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@fyb012000002 /home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev]# make install-info

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev/doc/manual'
make: [install-info] Error 2 (ignored)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens from R-1.2.3 (and previous) as well as for R-devel (1.3.0).
Anything to worry about (it seens harmless)?

Thanks

In the devel snapshot from this morning a previously saved workspace (.RData) does
not get loaded. (If that is a new feature I missed it in the NEWS file.)

It's likely caused by

/doc/manual/Makefile:  @$(MKINSTALLDIRS) -p $(infodir)

in which I suspect that one can safely lose the "-p" since
mkinstalldirs obviously doesn't know what to do with it...

BTW we seem to be alternately using $(MKINSTALLDIRS) and
$(top_srcdir)/tools/mkinstalldirs for this purpose. Anyone have a clue
on whether this ought to be standardized?

Indeed! 
I've removed the "-p" and it worked well.

Thanks for spotting this.  The `-p' is wrong.  Removed now.

Yes, of course.  We use the latter in the add-on package Makefiles.
These do not include $(top_builddir)/Makeconf where MKINSTALLDIRS is
defined.  I think we can safely stay with the current solution.

Best,

Hm. Doesn't happen with 1.2.3 on Linux and dbeta.c hasn't changed
inbetween. Any chance of getting you to step through the computations
with a debugger on you machine?

It does happen on Solaris 2.7, though, which might give Peter a means
to look at it on an earlier Solaris.

Indeedy. Looks like we're passing a-1 and a+b-2 on to dbinom_raw as x
and n respectively and this comes out with x > n due to roundoff so we
get zero returned.

Argh, how does one fix that?

(It's usually the intel FPUs that pull that kind of stunt on us...)

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Moved to R-devel: I think this is actually an issue about the X11 device
and is getting technical.  Maybe CRAN/Devel packages are best discussed on
R-devel anyway.

That X server has DPS and type 1 scaleable fonts including for Helvetica.
The X11 device chooses fonts by

devX11.c:static char *fontname_R6 =
"-adobe-helvetica-%s-%s-*-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*

and if the X server does not have Adobe Helvetica in the specified size
etc one would need to look at exactly what it does give you.  My
Solaris one will have Adobe Helvetica in the right encoding.

Actually, that's an S/S incompatibility:

S-PLUS : Copyright (c) 1988, 1996 MathSoft, Inc.
S : Copyright AT&T.
Version 3.4 Release 1 for Sun SPARC, SunOS 5.3 : 1996 
Working data will be in .Data 
cbind(data.frame(x=1,y=2), data.frame(x=4,u=3))
  x y x u 
1 1 2 4 3

(We might of course still want to follow the more recent S-PLUS,
although perhaps not put too draconian measures in to keep names
unique.)

Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.33.0106071439180.48906-100000@homer17.u.washington.edu>


The AIX build of the development version isn't quite working due to a
problem in the automatic symbol extraction process.

Compilation of R itself goes fine, but then in the script tools/ldAIX4
doesn't extract the symbols from arithmetic.o.  This is because
  bash-2.01$ nm arithmetic.o
  nm: arithmetic.o: 0654-206 Cannot process the symbol table.

As a result, R_finite is not exported and the vfonts module cannot be
built.  If the necessary symbols are added by hand to etc/R.exp then the
rest of the build proceeds normally.

Compiling arithmetic.c doesn't produce any errors (gcc) and the symbol
table problem doesn't seem to happen for any other object file.

Any ideas?

Not really.  Which nm is that, the native one or from GNU binutils?

Subject: [Rd] Generalising object.size
Message-ID: <3B208DC1.4947887E@durham.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Currently (R-1.2.3) object.size called with an environment tells you the
size of the environment handle but not the size of the sum of the
objects contained within the environment.  Is anyone but me interested
in the following simple generalisation:

"object.size" <- function (x, expand.envir = FALSE)
{
  if (expand.envir && is.environment(x)) {
    s <- 0
    for (i in ls(envir=x))
      s <- s + Recall(get(i, envir=x))
    s
  } else
    .Internal(object.size(x))
}

> fred <- new.env()
> assign("letters", letters, envir=fred)
> assign("numbers", 1:10, envir=fred) 
> object.size(fred)
[1] 28
> object.size(fred, TRUE)
[1] 408

As an aside, I had to use a for-loop here because Recall does not work
inside a sapply:

	sum(sapply(ls(envir=x), function(i) Recall(get(i, envir=x))))

causes an infinite recursion because the wrong function gets
"Recall"-ed.  Is there any way around this?

Cheers, Jonathan.

yes, indeed!

And, btw, the bug is gone in R version 1.2.3 (and R-devel):

Subject: [Rd] update.packages fails again (PR#972)
Message-ID: <200106082025.WAA20114@pubhealth.ku.dk>

It's happened again:

exactRankTests_0.4-2.tar.gz has

Depends: R > 1.3.0

which is not only impossible, but breaks update.packages.

How can we test for this?

Unfortunately once such a package is installed, it has to be manually
uninstalled before update.packages will work again.

*PLEASE* can people read the manual to get the syntax right: it is

Depends: R (>= 1.3.0)

but such packages should not be in the main part of CRAN yet.

yes.  What changed from r-release to r-devel is how the endianness
flags, hw and lw, are handled.  Get rid of the const or the static
keyword, and arithmetic.c compiles and nm can read the symbol table.
Looks like a compiler/assembler bug to me...

Suggestion until 'static const int' works in AIX: Change around line 87:

#ifndef _AIX
#  ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
static const int hw = 0;
static const int  lw = 1;
#  else  /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
static const int hw = 1;
static const int lw = 0;
#  endif /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#else
        /* 'static const int' doesn't work on AIX */
#  ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
static int hw = 0;
static int  lw = 1;
#  else  /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
static int hw = 1;
static int lw = 0;
#  endif /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#endif

Above compiles, links, etc. for me with r-devel from today.


> Not really.  Which nm is that, the native one or from GNU binutils?

I had the problems with the native one.  I don't have the GNU binutils
installed.

I'll check this after my build with the native cc/f77 finishes (it takes
about four hours).  It doesn't look as though the native compilers have
this problem -- it's got as far as the help pages, which are the slowest
part.

Subject: [Rd] Add smooth curves with panel.superpose
Message-ID: <200106090111.LAA01097@leonard.anu.edu.au>

I propose an extesion of the settings available for the
type parameter in panel.superpose(), thus:

type if "p" points are plotted, if "l", the points are 
  joined by lines, if "b" there are points and lines,
  if "s" there are points and a smooth fitted curve,
  if "S" there is a curve.

Example:

library(mass)
data(cabbages)
xyplot(HeadWt~VitC|Date, panel=panel.superpose,
   groups=Cult, data=cabbages, type="s",span=2)
xyplot(HeadWt~VitC|Date, panel=panel.superpose,
   groups=Cult, data=cabbages, type="s",span=2)

Here is the altered code.  The changes are in the statements
          if (type == "p" || type == "b"||type=="s"){ ....}
and the new code:
                if ((type=="s"||type=="S")&&is.finite(x[id])&&

I have a version of R-devel with the gnome device compiled for
Mac OS X. The compiling/linking goes without glitches. My
gnome system works fine for other purposes (for instance
for building gimp and guppi), but "R --gui=gnome" says

Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library
Gdk-ERROR **: BadLength (poly request too large or internal Xlib length 
erro

I dont care about the warning, but maybe someone recognizes
the error.

Damn it.  I thought that my Perl code in R CMD check

    if($description->{"Depends"} =~ /\bR *\([^)]*\)/) {
        ## The `Depends' field is not required, and currently only R
        ## version dependencies are used, which must be of the form
        ## `R ($op $version)' with `$op' one of `<=' or `>='.
        $log->checking("DESCRIPTION Depends field");
        $description->{"Depends"} =~ /\bR *\(([^) ]+) *([^) ]+)\)/;
        if((($1 eq "<=") || ($1 eq ">=")) && $2) {
            $log->result("OK");
        }
        else {
            $log->warning();
            $log->message("  malformed Depends field");
        }
    }

was good enough.  It is intended to check for just that: even more
precisely for exactly what is used by R lateron.

For the offending package I get no warning.  Argh.

How can this be installed?  I though if you ran R CMD INSTALL then it
would figure this out.  At least, this is what

  depends=`get_dcf_field Depends DESCRIPTION`
  depends=`echo ${depends} | grep 'R *('`
  if test "${depends}"; then
    depends=`echo ${depends} | sed 's/.*R *(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/;s/=/= /'`
    dep_operator=`set - ${depends}; echo ${1}`
    dep_version=`set - ${depends}; echo ${2}`
    ## Currently, only operators `<=' and `>=' are supported.  Hence we
    ## check this, and also whether we found a version string.
    if (test "${dep_operator}" = "<=" \
        || test "${dep_operator}" = ">=") \
        && test -n "${dep_version}"; then
      dep_ok=`expr ${R_VERSION} ${dep_operator} ${dep_version} `
      if test ${dep_ok} -eq 0; then
        echo "ERROR: This R is version ${R_VERSION}"
        echo "       package \`${pkg}' depends on R ${dep_version}"
        exit 1;
      fi
    else
      echo "WARNING: malformed \`Depends' field in \`DESCRIPTION'"
    fi
  fi

in INSTALL is supposed to do.  Same problem, most likely.

Will have a look later.

Subject: [Rd] documentation and \sloppy (PR#976)
Message-ID: <200106102050.WAA26838@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi
When preparing documentation using Rd2dvi sometimes we get "overflow" on
some lines. The consequence is that in the documentation there are some
lines where words are not hyphenated or moved. The final document has some
lines with more columns than the rest of the text. 
This happens when we use \code{} (which probably calls the \tt in latex).

I've been checking the documentation (.pdf files) of a few packages  and
this seens to occours all over.

One possible way to correct this is  by introducing the command
\sloppy
on the header of the automatically generated .tex files. It seens to work
fine in some tests I've run.

I'm wondering whether the "\sloppy" can be incorporated to the Rd2dvi
command. 

Cheers
P.J.

Subject: [Rd] Additional output in cancor
Message-ID: <3B247F91.CAD6F5E4@durham.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Can I suggest an additional output component in cancor, from package
mva?  It would be useful to have the number of canonical correlation
vectors, equivalently the rank of the covariance between x and y (label
"rank").  This would usually be min(dx, dy), where dx and dy have
already been computed for the svd function, but there might be
situations where it was less than this, so I guess the safe option would
be to include

	rank = qr(t(x) %*% y)$rank

among the outputs.  Then the last four lines of the help might be
amended to

     rk <- cxy$rank
     all.equal(cor(x %*% cxy$xcoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE],
       y %*% cxy$ycoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(cxy$cor))
     all.equal(cor(x %*% cxy$xcoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(1, rk))
     all.equal(cor(y %*% cxy$ycoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(1, rk))

which I think is more intuitive.

More radically, the xcoef and ycoef components of cancor might
themselves be restricted to the appropriate columns (1:rank).  This
might affect some existing code, although any code that uses the
non-informative columns has got to be broken, hasn't it?!

Can I also suggest an extra reference for the help page:

Oh, great timing!   R went into feature-freeze last night for 1.3.0.
No new features until 1.4.0 in December or whatever comes next.

Nope.  It's rare, but needing to span the orthocomplement can happen.

I'd say that was inferior to Seber (and I find it rather confusing).

Small new features have been known to slip into the patch releases
though, but if there's *any* chance of getting something wrong, we
should not include it during feature freeze, however little it might
seem. Changing arguments and result components must be off-limits by
principle, if only because the effort invested in ensuring that they
are harmless would be better spent on fixing known bugs.

Yes it can, using the Rd.cfg mechanism.  If there is a file Rd.cfg in your
TEXINPUTS path, it gets read at the bottom of Rd.sty.  This should allow
you to change the TeX penalties (which is what \sloppy does AFAIR).

I think Rd2dvi is intended only to be a simple mechanism to produce
a reasonable printed manual, but the Rd.cfg mechanism allows some
customization.  My view is that a few overlaps into the right margin is
less distracting that the `loose' typesetting that \sloppy encourages.

To my inverted way of thinking there is something wrong with the general
logic of what is being attempted here.

I think people should be encouraged to upgrade to the most recent
released version of R. At best I test my packages with the last two
releases of R, so it is only by accident that the "Depends" line on my
packages may not specify the most recent release.

On the other hand, an unmaintained package could quickly depend on an
older version of R. I don't see any way a package maintainer can specify
this, but there could be some mechanism (possible tied to passing R CMD
check) that specifies dependency on an older version of R. Perhaps this
might also be formally recognized as a mechanism for moving things out
of the contrib section of CRAN.  If this is to be written into a file in
the package it would require modifying the contents of the tar ball, but
if it could be coded into a prefix on the package name it might be
simpler?

The logic is to allow packages to depend on unreleased versions, or
known new features (only in x.y.0 releases, of course ...).

It's useful for the >=1.3.0 versions around at present, and of course
as an encouragement to upgrade.

Yes, but the problem is that building a package now, say for 1.3.0,
who  knows whether one should specify

Depends: R (< 2.0)
or
Depends: R (< 3.0)

And when those versions come along the maintainer may not be around to
make the change to the Depends line. (An if they were they would
probably update the package instead.)

Yes, a < depends should almost never be correct. However, changing it to a
prefix doesn't help with this.  About the only situation when this would
apply is if we decide to break source compatibility  (eg to put threads
in). Here the CRAN maintainers will know what the dependency is, but it
may not be fixed immediately.

We don't want the depends to mean "was only tested with". It should mean
"will not work without". In most cases only the package maintainer can
distinguish between a bug (which may be exposed more clearly by a new
version of R)  and a valid dependency.

Actually, a `<' never is.  Only `<=' and `>=' are allowed, according to
the docs.

We have an informal mechanism of moving old versions into version
specific ``old'' subdirs.  Here's what happens.  When a new release
comes along I test all packages (argh) against the new version.  The
ones that do not pass R CMD check for the new version will be moved out
to the `old' subdirs, unless a new version comes along (in which case
they are stored somewhere else).

At least, this was the old way.  Now that we actually have an archive of
old packages, we maybe should put them in there as well and record the
last version they were known to work with somewhere else.  (Or change
the DESCRIPTION Depends info accordingly?)

Argh.

Subject: [Rd] R-devel on alpha Tru64: cxml/dxml problem (PR#977)
Message-ID: <200106111812.UAA09885@pubhealth.ku.dk>



Hi,

I just run a ./configure --enable-R-shlib; make; make check; with a recent
(11.6.2001) R-devel snapshot on Tru64 4.0F (with libcxml):

make check stops in base-Ex.R at:

> ###--- >>> `plot.window' <<<----- Set up World Coordinates for Graphics
Window>
>       ## alias         help(plot.window)

Error in La.eigen(Tmat, symmetric = TRUE) :
        On entry to DSYEV  parameter number 8 had an illegal value
Execution halted

The problem is, that by default the accelerated blas library (libdxml or
libcxml) is found by ./configure and gets used (DSYEV resides in this
library) 

I stopped using libdxml/libcxml with R long ago because I had similar
problems (using libdxml on Tru64 4.0E) with some of my libraries, but I
thought it was my fault. The interesting thing is, that some of the dxml
functions are useable, some not.

Now I took a closer look and recognized that libdxml/libcxml are linked
with the DEC/Compaq Fortran runtime libraries:

agebhard@alpha4-stat[R-devel]$ odump -Dl /usr/shlib/libcxml.so

                        ***LIBRARY LIST SECTION***

        libc.so      Jun 12 20:14:23 2000 0xbad758ae     0 osf.1

I guess because we are using gcc/g77 and not DEC cc/f77 we cannot use
CXML/DXML libraries.

And indeed, make check succeeds with "--without-blas" added to the
configure options.

Solution:

I would suggest to modify the configure script not to use dxml/cxml on
alpha-tru64 by default.

TL>We don't want the depends to mean "was only tested with". It should

I guess this is where I was confused. I was thinking that depends should
indicate to a user that the version of a package and version(s) of R
have been tested together. "Have been tested together" seems like useful
information for a user, but I guess the real philosophy on that is that
a user should get the latest release R and the latest version of a
package from CRAN and these have been tested together (I think).

I think you should promote the "upgrade to the latest version" approach
and not put too much effort into which old versions of packages work
with old versions of R. The depends information which is in a package
will already give people a pretty good clue if they are really desperate
for a package that is no longer being maintained.  My concern was mainly
because I did not at first realize that you already had a mechanism for
moving packages to "old."

R developers: anyone against that?

If not: Albrecht, can you suggest code which fixes the problem?  Should
we turn off checking for dxml/cxml in general?  I'd rather not special
case a specific platform (or even in combo with a specific compiler).

I think we should just remove the checks.  They are run on all platforms
even though only relevant to one, and they can in any case be specified
via -with-blas=foo for some `foo' (cxml or dxml, I think).

> case a specific platform (or even in combo with a specific compiler).

Even though we are in feature free, zapping the following lines in
m4/R.m4 seems innocent enough:

if test "x$BLAS_LIBS" = x; then
  # BLAS in Alpha CXML library?
  AC_CHECK_LIB(cxml, $dgemm_func, BLAS_LIBS="-lcxml", , $FLIBS)
fi

if test "x$BLAS_LIBS" = x; then
  # BLAS in Alpha DXML library? (now called CXML, see above)
  AC_CHECK_LIB(dxml, $dgemm_func, BLAS_LIBS="-ldxml", , $FLIBS)
fi

If we do this, we need to add the info to R-admin.texi.

[Yes.  Plus take not that we modified the macro taken from Octave and
need to talk to JWE about it.]

Dear R Core Team,

I'm wondering whether it is useful that every package should allow 
for help(PackageName), giving some general information about the 
package (more/nicer than library(help=PackageName)). This man page 
may include some mathematical or statistical background, or contain 
a guideline for the package.

Cheers,
Martin

help(nlme) would be ambiguous then. 

help(package=nlme) already works, same as library(help=nlme). 

I suppose we could make it a convention to have each package contain
an Overview entry so that help(Overview, package=nlme) would do what
you want (or even help(Overview, nlme) if we switch the arguments
around), but someone would have to write those pages....

Subject: [Rd] Using konqueror with help.start
Message-ID: <6r8zixwza2.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

For R-1.2.3 on a Debian 2.3 (testing) GNU/Linux system I would like
to have help.start use Konqueror (the KDE web browser) instead of
netscape.  I can start it with

 help.start(browser = "konqueror")

but trying to search for terms from the search page does not work.  

My guess is that I need to configure javascript.  The default is not
to allow javascript at all.  I do not wish to enable javascript
globally.  Under Settings->Configure Konqueror->Javascript I have set
accept for the localhost Host/domain.  This does not seem to help.

Can anyone give instructions on how I can allow searching without
globally enabling javascript?

This is important to me because there is a long-standing wishlist bug
against the Debian r-base package that I could close if I could use
show that Konqueror could be used instead of netscape.

Meanwhile (and with a new help system planned, I mean until that is
onstream), you will find discussion of this topic in the R-devel archives,
and should note that several packages already use INDEX for this purpose.
Try

library(help=boot)

for one.

Hmm ... I raised the issue about help.start() support for browsers other
than netscape a few weeks ago.  I seem to recall that as neither mozilla
(bug) nor konqueror (feature?) can be controlled remotely in the way
netscape does, we decided to not pursue this any further.

It seems that all you want is getting help.start() to work and use the
Java search engine, but what good would this be?  The next help() would
not be able to display HTML output in the same konqueror windows ...

The R help.start() search uses Java and not Javascript. They are
almost nothing to do with each other, and are enabled independently in
Netscape.

Does konqueror have Java support?

If you run help.start using netscape you will see

`Starting Java'

Yes, but even enabling that globally still leaves the R search function
busted as I verified earlier on my work box (using KDE 2.1.* under
Debian 2.3).

Quite a shame because konqueror is my preferred browser. Real pretty
with the anti-aliased fonts.

I just ran into the following problem.  I am not sure what causes it, but
here is the scenario:

(1) I start R with 512Mb of memory.  (I am on an Win2000 PC with 512Mb of
physical memory)
(2) I put a couple of small functions in my workspace and I generate two
real vectors x and y of length 2^19 (542288) each.
(3) I save this workspace.  The size of the saved file is about 8.4Mb.
(4) I run lm to fit y vs. x using an 11 parameter model.  I generate a
couple of plots.  Everything is fine.  (BTW, this runs out of memory with
standard 256Mb allocation of maximum memory).
(5) I regenerate y (it is a simulated example) overwriting the old one.
(6) I run (4) again and I am getting:
     Error: cannot allocate vector of size 45056kb
     Reached total allocation of 512Mb
      This happens even if I run gc() after (5).
(7) Now comes an interesting part.  If I save the image right now the size
of it is about 159Mb although I do not have any new objects in my workspace
(there is a hidden object .Trace, but it is  small).
(8) If I do
     rm(list=ls(pos=1), pos=1)
      however, the size of the workspace comes back to almost zero.

I am not sure if this happens on Linux since my Linux box only has 192Mb of
memory.

Is this the new memory management problem?  Is there any way around it?

Thanks in advance,

Andy

No, it's an old one, called fragmentation, I expect.  There may be no
free space of size 45Mb, and remember R no longer moves objects.  Also,
the allocation over 256Mb may well be fragmented.

I think you have the solution already: remove objects you are no longer
using.

Or increase the memory allocation to 2Gb: since you have big objects, NT's
virtual memory should do a good job.  That limit is really only there to
avoid paging on small systems, especially ones with VFAT file systems
(you are running NTFS I hope).  You may still get allocation problems.

Subject: [Rd] Preview of rw1030
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0106131724020.1159-100000@gannet.stats>

I've put up at

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/RWin/SetupR.exe

a (15Mb) `release candidate' of rw1030.  It's a snapshot of the complete
release but not everything (especially the recommended packages) is in
final form.

I would particularly be interested in feedback on two points:

1) The claim is that utilities like Rcmd check now work on 16-bit versions
of Windows.  Certainly with the latest perl (626) I was able to do all I
tested, including installing and checking bundles, on Windows 98.

2) There are inbuilt capabilities to download files (and more), and
update.packages() can be run from a menu.  Does this work on old low-end
systems?  If not, does the alternative given in CHANGES work?

Also on anything else ... we will be doing more checking before release.

Subject: [Rd] expand.model.frame() fails when subset is specified (PR#979)
Message-ID: <200106141815.UAA16660@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Gregory R. Warnes
Version: 1.2.0, 1.2.3
OS: SunOS gsun124 5.8 Generic_108528-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
Submission from: (NULL) (12.18.36.49)


When using expand.model.frame on a model that specifies a subset selection, 
an error is generated on the variable used for the subset selection.  

Example:

> data <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10,z=1:10,m=1:10)
> model <- lm( y ~ x, data=data, subset=m<8)
> expand.model.frame(model, ~ z)
Error in [.data.frame(structure(list(y = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,  : 
        Object "m" not found

The patch below uses "eval" and "call" with the appropriate
environment instead of calling model.frame directly. This results in:

> source("/home/warneg/R-src/R-1.2.3/src/library/base/R/expand.model.frame.R")
> expand.model.frame(model, ~ z)
  y x z
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5
6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7

Thanks. This is also present in the current pre-1.3.0. Your patch
looks correct, but I wonder if the default for "enclos" should not be
environment(formula(model)) rather than parent.frame() as it is now?

(And wouldn't it be better named "envir"?)

Peter,

I was merely making an incremental improvement, your suggestions provide
additional improvements.   Go right ahead and make the changes.  [This seems
wierd, are you asking 
me, non-R-core person that I am, permission to make changes to the R source
code?]

Just for illustration, here's an example of why it is better to use  
environment(formula(model)) rather than parent.frame():

	> fun <- function() {
	+ data <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10,z=1:10,m=1:10)
	+ model <- lm( y ~ x, data=data, subset=m<8)
	+ model
	}

	> test <- fun()
	> 

With my version:

	> expand.model.frame(test, ~ z )
	Error in as.data.frame.default(data) : can't coerce function into a
data.frame

With the additional changes:

	> test  <-  fun()
	> expand.model.frame(test, ~ z )
	  y x z
	1 1 1 1
	2 2 2 2
	3 3 3 3	
	4 4 4 4
	5 5 5 5
	6 6 6 6
	7 7 7 7

Pretty nifty.  

-Greg

Subject: [Rd] read.xport() bug (PR#981)
Message-ID: <200106142225.AAA17768@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Aimee Teo Broman
Version: 1.23
OS: Windows 98
Submission from: (NULL) (162.129.145.115)


When I use the read.xport() function in the foreign library, the Rgui shuts
down.   My xport file was created in SAS ver.6, using the xport engine in proc
copy. 

R commands:
1. library(foreign)
2. lookup.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this works fine.
3. read.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this produces a window that says "This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down."  The details are shown
below:

RGUI caused an invalid page fault in
module FOREIGN.DLL at 017f:14c727e7.
Registers:
EAX=00000000 CS=017f EIP=14c727e7 EFLGS=00010246
EBX=034a1320 SS=0187 ESP=0270f404 EBP=0270f46c

EDX=034a1338 ES=0187 EDI=034a1335 GS=0000
Bytes at CS:EIP:
c6 00 00 83 c4 fc 83 c4 10 39 d8 75 09 a1 48 02 
Stack dump:
034a1320 00000020 034b5a50 78037ce8 02c5cf68 00000002 0270f4ac 004250ae 00585140
02c5c728 0270f46c 00000079 00000001 0348c150 0348e9d0 78037ce8 

The date on the foreign.zip file is 18-May-2001, so I believe I have the most
recent version of both R and the foreign package.  I would call this an
intermittant problem, except that I have this problem more frequently than not.
Yesterday it was working, but today it is shutting down the gui again.  Any help
would be appreciated.

thanks much,
Aimee Broman

Sorry, I might have made that more clear. Followups on bug reports get
CC'ed into R-bugs and stored with the original report, as well as
circulated via R-devel. I was just making a note for whoever might have
a better informed opinion than myself, as well as for the person who'll
get around to putting in the fix eventually (which might well be
myself).

Message-ID: <200106150648.IAA19216@pubhealth.ku.dk>

All packages have a version number, in their DESCRIPTION file or via

package.description("foreign")$Version

I suspect this is 0.4-3, but please confirm.

We do need a reproducible example to make any sense of this bug report, and
for that we need fdt.tpt.  Could you please attach that file to your reply.

Subject: [Rd] R CMD check (PR#982)
Message-ID: <200106151929.VAA27886@pubhealth.ku.dk>

In revising the splancs package, I use R CMD check. After a number of
changes to various files in the directory tree, R CMD check fails at the
* checking for undocumented objects ... ERROR
stage as shown below. But running undoc() in R (pointed at the Rcheck
directory, not on the older version) doesn't show the same error, and grep
on the Rcheck R code finds the function. I ran undoc() under debug() too,
to be sure that it was looking in the Rcheck location, not the default
library.

PS: Specifically I was responding to Kurt's note re:
$as.points
$as.points$code
[1] "..."
$as.points$docs
[1] "p"
and doing work on documentation as well. as.points is (...) in both code
and docs now. Is it the ellipsis that is the problem?

Can you put a snapshot of what you have into CRAN's incoming area?

the perl version check in the configurte script

clearly fails, but e.g.
/usr/bin/perl -v | sed -n 's/^.*perl.*v\([0-9]\).*/\1/p'
would work.

Finally

usr/bin/perl -v | \

works on systems with a perl version of "perl, v5.xxx" and "perl, version

Sorry, this was my fault, I mixed up R-devel.tar.gz with a very old
version laying around in my RPM_SOURCE Directory, ... I should have used
the version from my home dir.

sorry

Hi,
two small typos in `?write.table' (R 1.2.3)

In the doc of the append parameter:

 append: logical. If true, the output is appended to targshe file.
that should be "... to the file".

and in the Details section, a full-stop is missing after names:

  Normally there is no column name for a column of row names If

Cheers,
Stephen

Apparently, both of those got fixed on the 1.3.0 branch a couple of
months ago. (Before the release of 1.2.3, in fact...)

Thanks anyway. It's nice to have people looking out for this kind of
problems.

There was no Macintosh device when it was written, and when it was
re-implemented this was not changed.

Implemented for 1.3.0.

Subject: [Rd] approxfun(*, ties=) returning "random" result (PR#986)
Message-ID: <200106181035.MAA09201@pubhealth.ku.dk>

  Platforms  : SunOS and Linux, both using gcc 2.95.[23]
  R versions : 1.2.3 and "R-devel"

I came accross this when trying to debug a somewhat sub-optimal behavior of
ecdf() from package stepfun.
What happens is that  approxfun(*, ties = <function>)
does not always return the same result for identical arguments.
I tried "min", "max", and "mean" all of which are mentioned on the help page.
>From looking at both R and C code, I wonder if the bug is not even deep
inside where .C(......) is handled, or somewhere else ``deep down''...

I could debug more myself, but given the ``immediate release'' and my
limited resources, I'll pass this on :

###---------- the following is executable; read and follow the comments

n <- length(xt <- c(.4,.4,.4,1,1.05,2,3,3,3.4, 4,4,4,4:5, 7,7))

e2 <- approxfun(xt,(1:n)/n, method = "const", yl=0, yr=1, f=0, ties=max)
e2(xt)# all "1" (well mostly...)
gcinfo(TRUE)
## Execute the following (long) line a few times...
## the non-1 solution happens often (not always!) immediately *after* GC..
for(i in 1:100) {ee <- e2(xt);if(!is.na(b <- all(ee == 1)) && b) cat(".") else cat("\n",16*ee,"\n")}

## The problem happens only when  ties = <function>, not for ties = "ordered":
e1 <- approxfun(xt,(1:n)/n, method = "const", yl=0, yr=1, f=0, ties="ordered")
e1xt <- c(3,3,3:6,8,8,9,rep(13,4),14,15,15)/16
stopifnot(e1(xt) == e1xt)

## Execute the following (long) line a few times...
## -- no problem, always "........."
for(i in 1:100) {ee <- e1(xt);if(!is.na(b <- all(ee == e1xt))&& b)cat(".") else cat("\n",16*ee,"\n")}

...but yes, we almost forgot it again. Just goes to show the
advantage of using the bug repository when reporting.

No, the problem is that `n', the length of the x and y vectors, is not
recomputed when the ties are removed.  Thus in your example two 9-element
vectors are passed down to a C routine that is told they are 16 elements
long. Bad.

I'll commit the obvious fix after make check.

I asked Prof. Brian Ripley if I might submit some text/input for the
R-intro writers, he said this is the place to do it.

I was on a plane a couple of weeks ago reading R-intro as I plan for a
course and made these notes, some of which I think will help my students
if you incorporate them.  I've attached a raw text file I wrote in Emacs
to this message "Rintrochanges.txt".

I have written documents like R-intro before and understand it is
difficult to please everybody, and I thank you for your effort on the
project.

R-intro comments/enhancements  Part I.

I think something more verbose like this would help under
"Ordered and Unordered factors"

Texts on research design emphasize that variables have
different levels of measurement. Typically, there are three levels.
If a measurement is taken with a precise scale (one on which it is
meaningful to say new_value = b*old_value, as with readings of a
thermometer), it is considered an "interval" level variable.  Many
statistical models were originally designed for interval level
variables.  If a measurement is not so precise, but only provides an
ordered categorization of observations, such as "low" "medium" and
"high", it is called an ordinal variable.  If a measurement is
categorical and implies no sense of ordering, such as "European",
"Asian", or "South American", then it is typically called an ordinal
variable.  Assigning the values of "1", "2", and "3" to these
observations has no substantive significance, as we might as well
number them "3","2","1".

Many statistical models are designed for interval level data, but with
appropriate recoding of input, they can also be made to work with
nominal and ordinal data.  In the "old days" of statistical computing,
users were forced to create a lot of indicator (or "dummy") variables,
thereby converting information from nominal or ordinal measurements
into variables that have only values 0 and 1.  For example, to
represent the information about the home continents of survey
respondents, we might create two dummy variables, one for Asia (coded
1 if respondent is from Asia, 0 otherwise) and one for South America
(likewise 0 and 1).  A respondent for whom we find both of these dummy
variables equal to 0 is sure to be from Europe, so we don't usually
need to create three dummy variables.  Doing so would be redundant.

With a modern language like R, much of the drudgery of creating the
indicator variables is handled automatically if the user declares the
variables properly.  In R, and S before it, the term "factor" is used
to refer to a variable that is not measured at the interval level. An
"unordered factor" is a nominal (or categorical) variable, while an
"ordered factor" is the term for an ordinal measurement.  Many
statistical procedures in R have builtin procedures for handling
factors.

Beyond handling coding of noninterval variables, factors play a vital
role in many R procedures.  Procedures can be designed to do a chore
for each value of a factor.  Many procedures will in fact insist that
a variable be designated as a factor.

 ------------------


In this section "Named arguments and defaults", I am left in a
confusion about a few things.  This confusion has bothered me a while.
Can you do more to explain which arguments must be specified, which
are optional, and under what conditions is it necessary to include the
parameter= which calling a function.

1.  When I use a function, and I look in its help page, how do I know
which input variables must be declared and which can be ignored?  This
is quite mysterious.  When invocations leave out some arguments, how
does R "sift through" the ones that are provided to know which is
which?


For example, consider the page on "update.packages".  

Under Usage, I find:
update.packages(lib.loc = .lib.loc, CRAN = getOption("CRAN"),
                contriburl = contrib.url(CRAN),
                method = "auto", instlib = NULL,
                ask=TRUE, available=NULL, destdir=NULL)

I've been using computers a long time, and I use this function every two months or so.  Between times I forget, come back to this page, and still this one leaves me totally confused.  

After fiddling a while, I find this works on Linux:
>update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/library",CRAN="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN")

but what bothered me thd most is the "getOption("CRAN") option for CRAN.  I tried many variations on that and never figured how to make it work.


Maybe any clarifications could be related to the section "Getting help with functions and features"

In this section, I think it would be nice to have a paragraph about
"how to read a help page."  Some things are not obvious to all new
users.  Some things in help pages are tough to describe... Maybe I'd
say

How to read a help page.

If you find a help page, notice that it is made up of different parts.

1. "Description". These are usually terse, so read every word
   carefully.

2. Look for the "Value" heading.  That tells you what this procedure is
   going to return when you call it. If this procedure doesn't return
   what you need, you should find out immediately.

3. Under "Usage", most help pages list a number of possible commands
   that can be used.  These are not commands to be typed
   literally. Many of them contain abstract references which provide
   information about the nature of the variables that might be
   entered.  

   Here is a simple case.  The coefficients help page has this:

Usage

coef(object, ...)
coefficients(object, ...)

   Clearly, coef and coefficients are going to do the same thing, and you must supply the appropriate object.

4. Under "Arguments," the help page indicates what inputs this
   procedure wants.  The inputs are described line-by-line, and often
   the comments indicate of parameters are optional or what their
   default value might be.

   Many help pages have the infamous "...", which is something like
   "fill in the appropriately, depending on whatever context you
   find."  In some situations this is easy to understand .  Many help
   pages will eplicitly say that "..." refers to any options that
   might be used with a particular kind of object, and in that case
   one must find the help page for that other object. For example, the
   dev.copy help page clearly indicates that "..." refers to any
   options that might be used with the particular device in question.

   Other help pages are not so informative.  Consider the output from ?coefficients:

Arguments

 object
       an object for which the extraction of model coefficients is meaningful.
 ...
       other arguments.

Here it is clear you need to give a statistical object to have
coefficients removed.  The "..." is a mystery, and most R users will
try to use the coefficients command without worrying about it, and
then backtrack if an error occurs.  And, if an error occurs, there may be no recourse but to read the source code for this command or ask  about it in the r-help email list.

And the bug is?

The generic indexing should really be x[...,drop=T].  Methods for
specific classes can specialize to a particular number of indices if
they want to, which is what is happening here

> get ("[.data.frame")
function (x, i, j, drop = if (missing(i)) TRUE else length(cols) == 
    1) 

one could fairly easily slip in a "..." argument after "j", and then
inside the function give an error if "..." is not empty, but what
would the point be?

The point would be to catch errors like this

for ( i in 1:2 ) foo[i,2] <- my.fun( bar[,i,2] , another.arg )

that might otherwise pass unnoticed when 'bar' is a data.frame.

Subject: [Rd] par(mgp) bug (PR#916)
Message-ID: <200106190136.DAA15914@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi


> The behaviour of the third argument of par(mgp), which controls the
> placement of the axis ticks, is not working.
>
> In the following example, the plots should NOT be
> identical; the axis ticks plus the axis major line should be drawn one

This is more of an incompatibility-with-S rather than a bug.  In R,
axis(pos=) overrides axis(line=) which overrides par(mgp=).  It is possible
to get axis to respond to par(mgp=), but this is NOT the default behaviour.
For example,

par(mgp=c(3, 1, 1))
plot(1:10, axes=F)
box()
axis(1, line=NA)
axis(2)

In S, par(mgp=) specifies locations RELATIVE TO axis(line=), which can be
overridden by axis(pos=).

So the options are:
(i) become compatible NOW (for 1.3)
(ii) become compatible later
(iii) remain incompatible

I think we should do (i), especially because the default behaviour, which I
think would cover 99.999% of user code, would NOT change.

This is your chance to disagree ...

Subject: [Rd] Re: legend() with xpd=T; omission of initial plot character (PR#943)
Message-ID: <200106190356.FAA16102@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi

Bug summary:----
par(xpd=T)
plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.
Bug summary:----

I cannot reproduce this bug, BUT it did show up a bug in rect() -- in the
example above, the border around the legend is not drawn.

This is because rect() ignores par(xpd).  The default is rect(xpd=FALSE).  This
is at odds with text(xpd=NULL) and polygon(xpd=NULL) which use par(xpd) by
default.  arrows(xpd=FALSE) has the same problem as rect().  

I propose modifying rect() and arrows() to use par(xpd) by default like text()
and polygon().  There will, as usual, be a small risk that someone's code will
produce different output after this change, but this risk should be pretty
small.

Any objections ... ?

Paul

Giving an adj argument to axis() seems to have no effect.  In Splus, adj = 0

Coincidence, I *did* look at that bug only yesterday.
My experience:
   I *could* reproduce the bug {X11(), Linux-386}, but only a few times. 
   Then, it didn't show anymore. Even restarting R wouldn't show it again.
   My ``explanation'' was that it might be (a bug) inside X11 / Window manager
   handling of things... ??

not at all, but please fix  abline(*) at the same time.
It doesn't obey xpd either (PR#750).

I can now reproduce it -- I was looking in the wrong place: it's in
example(cmdscale) in the mva package.

Our Solaris compilers run this without problem: I've been running that test
most days.

We have

markov% f77 -V
f77: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 FORTRAN 77 5.2 2000/09/11
Usage: f77 [ options ] files.  Use 'f77 -flags' for details
markov% cc -V
cc: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C 5.2 2000/09/11
usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details

and I am usually running agressive optimization options, e.g.

CC="cc -xarch=v9"
FC="f95 -xarch=v9"

CFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -g"
FFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -g"

asn that by default uses the BLAS in -lsunperf.

What is your setup?

I have the 5.0 Sun Workshop compilers, and I wasn't using any of those
optimisation flags, though Fortran is using -lsunmath.

I just did configure, make, with CC="cc -xarch=v9" and FC="f77 -xarch=v9"

I'll try again with the alignment flags specified.

The crash is caused by a bus error: address alignment. Recompiling without
-lsunperf and with -dalign fixes it.

I think there is a configuration issue here (not for 1.3.0, though). The
documentation for the Sun BLAS says that -dalign is needed, but the
default configuration is to use the Sun BLAS and not -dalign.

Ok.  Note that this part of the configure code is taken from Octave,
which used to be reliable.  It would be great if we could pass info on
problems and solutions on to John Eaton as well (in particular as I
think that at some point of time there was talk about adding the code to
the autoconf contrib archive).

We had a related problem last week, resulting in dropping CXML/DXML
support due to problems on 64-bit platforms with gcc (if I recall
correctly).

Hmm ...

Subject: [Rd] .eps form of the R logo
Message-ID: <6rae32j1zt.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

Thomas Lumley and I are creating slides for short courses on R.  We
are using the prosper style for LaTeX (see prosper.sourceforge.net)
which allows the use of a logo on the slides.  It seems to be able to
handle .ps or .eps files.  The only versions of the R logo that I have
been able to find are .jpeg.  Although I can convert the .jpeg file to
.eps in an image manipulation program like GIMP I would prefer not
to duplicate the effort of others.  Has someone already done this?  If
so, where would I find the file?

I will add that to R-admin.texi, though.

I am not 100% sure this can be automated.  For a start, there are lots of
versions of the Sun compilers, and Thomas' is not current.  Really the
issue is that the compiler flags had better match, and that is very hard to
ensure except manually.  My f77 man page does say

          If you compile one subprogram or file with -dalign,
          then all subprograms and files in the program unit must
          be compiled with -dalign.

and my system is current (re-installed a month ago).

This issue comes up with mixed compilers too: AFAIR gcc does the equivalent
of -dalign and so could not be used with S-PLUS 3.2 (or about then, built
with SunPro cc).

Just gcc on Alpha running whatever Compaq calls Dec's UNIX today. CXML/DXML
are compiled with a different compiler.


So the general issue is the you need to ensure that you use the same
compiler and the same flags to compile R as you used for the libraries you
use, or know the perils if you do not.  I've just added a warning to
R-admin.texi about that.

In the Rnews sources, on your machine, file Rlogo.eps.

I do teach my students not to put logos on slides, though.  They (and
frames) only serve to distract the eye from the real information.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Date: Thu, 11 Jan 2001 19:18:39 GMT
--1) On OSF4, strptime is deficient. Nothing we can do.
--
--2) On Windows NT, the strptime problems are (i) German locale, English dates,
--(ii) Windows system errors with unknown DST (it move times to DST).
--(i) now has another warning in the help file (there already was one).
--(ii) was already worked around for 1.2.1.
--
--3) bug.report() uses a mailer option that does not exist on OSF4.

I'm not sure if the warning messages 

Warning messages: 
1: variable 67 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  
2: variable 70 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  
3: variable 71 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  

reported by model.frame.default (thru predict.rpart)
are correct in the following situation:

R> library(rpart)
R> querschnittMar01 <- read.table("querschnittMar01.csv", header=T, sep=";")
R> y <- querschnittMar01$diagnose
R> design <- querschnittMar01[, c("msd","ag","at","myas","an","ai","eag","eat",
          "eas","ean","eai","abrg","abrt","abrs","abrn","abri","hic","mhcg",
          "mhct","mhcs","mhcn","mhci","phcg","phct","phcs","phcn","phci",
          "hvc","vbsg","vbst","vbss","vbsn","vbsi","vasg","vast","vass",
          "vasn","vasi","vbrg","vbrt","vbrs","vbrn","vbri","varg","vart",

          "tms","tmn","tmi","mr","rnf","mdic","emd","mv",
          "rh","alfah","alfav","sex","patalter","flimmer","familie",
          "blutdruck","groesse","gewicht","bmi")]
R> tree <- rpart(y ~ ., data=design)
R> predict.rpart(tree, design)

where "sex", "blutdruck" and "familie" are factors. 

The warnings are given from the following lines in model.frame.default:

if(length(xlev) > 0) {
        for(nm in names(xlev))
            if(!is.null(xl <- xlev[[nm]])) {
                xi <- data[[nm]]
                if(is.null(nxl <- levels(xi)))
                    warning(paste("variable", nm, "is not a factor"))


where

Browse[1]> xlev
$"67"
[1] "M" "W"		<- variable "sex"

$"70"
[1] "Ja"   "Nein" 	<- variable "familie"

$"71"
[1] "Hypertonie" "Hypotonie"  "Normal"    <- variable "blutdruck"


Browse[1]> nm
[1] "67"

and 

Browse[1]> data[[nm]]
NULL

BUT

Browse[1]> data[,67]
  [1] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W
W W
 [38] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M

[149] M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M

works as expected. The data is attached as querschnittMar01.csv.gz

Subject: [Rd] write.table(* , digits = ..) ?
Message-ID: <15159.4638.203418.415545@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Can anyone think of  reason why
  write.table() 
doesn't have an optional digits argument?
Via paste() and hence the internal "as.character" equivalent,
it obeys the options()$digits setting ...
which is quite logical for the experienced user, but not for others who
just want to `export' their data to a portable format.
I propose to add that argument in order to help these kind of users.

Well, it *is* covered in the `R Data Import/Export' manual under
write.table, and I assume all you intend to do is to include setting
options(digits=) and reset?

Why would you get 
  ../../../../share/make/../../../../etc/Makeconf
(all in one)?

The ctest Makefile has

top_builddir = ../../../..
R_HOME = $(top_builddir)
include $(top_builddir)/share/make/shlib.mk

and shlib.mk has

include $(R_HOME)/etc/Makeconf

???

Which version of make is this?

Yes, this had me confused as well...

Ahem...:
alnair:~/src/R-1.3.0> make -v
Make: Unknown flag argument v.  Stop.
Oh well, this is chaotic. All I know about this make is that
alnair:~/src/R-1.3.0> ls -l `which make`
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     system        15 Mar 25  1999 /bin/make -> ../ccs/bin/make

It seems I do have gmake version 3.79.1 as well, but it resulted in the
same error.

And I can't find g77....

Whoops, no sorry, it works with gmake 3.79.1! (I configured with
MAKE=/local/gnu/bin/make, but ran /bin/make). But I don't know yet if it
will pass make check.

Message-ID: <200106262348.BAA28121@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I got a double defined symbol when linking src/modules/internet.dll
because 
internet.c and sockconn.c include Rconnections.h (... and do not even
need
R_OutputCon).

One should possibly remove such a global definitinon from the header
file.
As a temporary solution I declared the variable extern in Rconnections.h
and 
added in src/main/printutils.c the definition (only this file and
src/main/connections.c really use the variable).

Um, that's definitely not in the code in the system you quote below.

Yes, but the problem is AFAICS in what your linker does, as my C books say
it should merge all the occurrences.  All our platforms on which we are
able to test do so.  I did think about this and look it up.

Given that you use a very unusual system yet expect code to work on it
unchanged, it would be helpful to us if you compiled the pre-release
versions from time to time and sent in suggestions before release.

The packages feature of Rgui is great! However it looks the directory structure
was changed for http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/, such that some
the packages are now under /rw1030 (e.g., VR) and are not found by
install.packages(). Thus the error message:

Error in download.file(url, destfile, method, mode = "wb") :

Please don't jump the gun: remember that rw1030 is not yet on CRAN
and was not released when CRAN last ran a sweep.

That's a very temporary change to avoid people updating on rw1023 to
versions that needed rw1030, and it will change on CRAN tomorrow.


However, VR is already one of the recommended packages which come with
rw1030, so you don't need to install it from CRAN.

Um, no, the directory structure is the same. There's just no VR.zip
file in it.  VR is *inside* rw1030 so why would you want to download
it? 

If by any chance you are still using 1.2.3, packages that have become
obsolete(-escent) now sit in

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/rw1023

Subject: [Rd] History via arrow keys broken (PR#999)
Message-ID: <200106271756.TAA08585@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Bill Kristan
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Linux Mandrake 8.0
Submission from: (NULL) (138.23.159.84)


I just downloaded the "unofficial" Mandrake 8.0 rpm from cran. So far the only
problem I've encountered is that my arrow keys no longer scroll through my
command history, but give ^[OA and ^[OB instead. Left and right arrow navigation
within a line is also broken. I checked previous reports, and when this was
reported in very early versions of R the suggested fix was to upgrade readline.
I upgraded to the newest available Mandrake rpm, which was readline-4.2-2, but
the behavior was the same. I was using the KDE terminal emulator, and tried
different keyboard layouts, but that didn't help either.

That would mean that the readline libs were not detected during the build phase.
I'd ask for a new build.

As a remedy, try running R within Emacs using the (outstanding) ESS mode.

The new na.exclude mechanism for linear models does not extend to
influence measures and diagnostics.

For the same reason, the plot method breaks for lm objects computed
with na.action=na.exclude.

x<-1:10
y<-c(rnorm(9),NA)
lm.influence(lm(y~x,na.action=na.exclude))

#Error in lm.influence(lm(y ~ x, na.action = na.exclude)) :

(This would have been our anniversary #1000 bug report, but some
spammer beat me to it - caught by Martin's filters, I assume)

Subject: [Rd] prototype for structured exception handling in R
Message-ID: <20010628102442.A7605@nokomis.stat.umn.edu>

One of the issues several of us have been discussing over the last few
months is how to incorporate a mechanism for structured exception
handling into R.  A prototype of one possible approach is available at

	http://www.stat.umn.edu/~luke/R/exceptions/simpcond.html

It is also available off the developer page,
http://developer.R-project.org.

The package that implements the prototype requires R 1.3.  (It is
mostly R code but needs a few hooks that have been added to R 1.3 to
allow experimenting with this sort of thing).

If you would find this sort of thing useful please give it a try and
let us know if you have any comments or suggestions.

Full_Name: George N. White III
Version: R-1.3.0 
OS: Irix 6.5
Submission from: (NULL) (142.176.61.253)


R-1.3.0 was built on Irix 6.5 using gcc and MIPSPro f90.  This combination has
worked for previous versions, in particular R-1.2.3.

$ cd test/Examples
$ ../../bin/R --vanilla < modreg-Ex.R > modreg-Ex.Rout

This worked in R-1.2.3.  It looks like there were a number 
of cosmetic changes to the modreg Fortran sources since R-1.2.3. 
SGI MIPSPro f90 was used to compile modreg, e.g.:

   f90 -OPT:IEEE_NaN_inf=ON -KPIC -O2 -c sslvrg.f -o sslvrg.o

did not fix the problem (so it may not be a compiler bug):

We had a private report of this on Iris 6.5, and the resolution was that it
worked with optimization off.

This is the only platform reporting a problem, so we need someone to debug
it there.

This is related to bug #865, which I have discovered is a problem with some
of the very basic transformation code in R graphics (for transforming widths
or heights when there are log scales).  I have a fix for this particular
mtext() problem, but I'm still working on the more general transformation
bug.

Subject: [Rd] interaction() -- problem with drop (PR#1003)
Message-ID: <200106290030.CAA22337@pubhealth.ku.dk>


(R-1.3.0 on linux, alpha and intel; also tested on R-1.1.1 on irix.)

Below is a program that creates some random data (n, x, and y), creates a
factor out of x and y and then creates a factor z out of their interaction
(corresponding, with the default nf = 2, to quadrants, which is how I came
upon this).  It then runs an analysis of variance.

f.test.problem <- 
function(n = 100, nf = 2){

  t1 <- data.frame(n = rnorm(n), x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))

  t1$x <- cut(t1$x, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$y <- cut(t1$y, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = F)
  
  print(table(t1$x))
  print(table(t1$y))
  print(table(t1$z))
  
  summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
}

Here's the problem:  if none of the nf * nf levels of z is empty -- that
is, if there is at least one trial taking on each value -- I get the error
"Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type".

traceback() gives:

8: model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts)
7: model.matrix(mt, mf, contrasts)
6: lm(formula = n ~ z, data = t1, singular.ok = TRUE)
5: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
4: eval(lmcall, parent.frame())
3: aov(n ~ z, data = t1)
2: summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
1: f.test.problem(nf = 3)


However, if one of the levels of z is empty (which I'm checking using
table), then the analysis of variance runs!  (Easy to see if you use nf =
4 or even 3; it won't take long to get some examples that run and some
that don't.)

Creating n and z outside of a dataframe and then running aov(n~z) doesn't
help.

The problem does not arise if I do aov(n ~ x, data = t1) or 
aov(n ~ y, data = t1) -- the analysis of variance runs whether there are
empty categories or not.


Finally:  if I specify drop = T in the interaction call:
t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = T)
then the analysis works whether a factor actually gets dropped or
not.  That is, even when no factor is empty (and so I got an error with
drop = F), everything works.

So the problem seems to arise from something going on in interaction.  I'm
not sure what, and I'm sure someone else will see the problem faster than
I will.

Apologies in advance if I'm being dense and this is really how things
ought to work.  If not, I'll submit a formal bug report.

Message-ID: <200106290549.HAA22957@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Based on a report to the Windows maintainers from Richard Rowe
<Richard.Rowe@jcu.edu.au>:

NEWS for 1.3.0 says

    o   Exact p-values are available for the two-sided two-sample
        Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

I think the (new) p-values are computed but are backwards:

I'll commit the obvious fix unless anyone knows better.  Neither value
agrees well with S-PLUS 6, which gives

Thanks for doing.  I had received a similar private bug report but had
not gotten to fixing this.

Strange because the underlying algorithm should be the same.  Have you
tried R vs Splus on larger samples (say, 100 each)?

The facility was not put in for Computer Modern, but for other more
normally encoded fonts (specifically Monotone Times and Lucida).  The
postscript help page does say

     It is the user's responsibility to check that suitable fonts are
     made available, and that they contain the needed characters when
     re-encoded.

and latter

     ###  ---- Use TeX's Computer Modern fonts ---
     ## Only use alphanumeric chars here.

R has the encoding hard-coded in plotmath.c, which is *much* more
serious, and is why Symbol is hardcoded.

I don't follows this. Only a single driver users afm files, and it has
several versions (ps, pdf, xfig).  How would the below be relevant to the
Windows drivers, say.

`Patches will be accepted' I think sums this up.  No other program I know
allows the flexibility that is already in R, and that took a lot of hard
work, which I am not sure you have appreciated.

You've forgotten -fPIC.  That should be found automatically: it is on
my Solaris 2.7 system using gcc-3.0.

Set CPICFLAGS (and probably FPICFLAGS and CXXPICFLAGS) in config.site,
make clean, reconfigure, rebuild.

Subject: [Rd] Rd tag \link not working without \code (PR#1006)
Message-ID: <200106300209.EAA02646@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Henrik Bengtsson
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Windows Me
Submission from: (NULL) (216.175.124.18)


Even though I know the Rd format might be replaced soon, I am report this just
in case:

The package optional argument for \link is *only* used when \link is in a \code
environment. Example:

  1) This link works: \code{\link[base]{cat}}
  2) But not this one: \link[base]{cat}

It looks like the "base" argument in the second case is not used at all. In HTML
this results in a "missing" link, i.e. the search page is called. It is 
interesting to use \link without \code for non-object help pages such as
"Introduction" etc.

It's a typo: line 564 of share/perl/R/Rdconv.pm should be

	my ($id, $arg, $opt) = get_link($text);

That really would not have been hard to investigate!

Yes, the documentation was clear on this. I was just hopeful that it would
work well enough to do all basic plot labels with TeX's fonts.

This might be a reason to alter the font encodings in the ps file to match
R, rather than try to change R. I'll have to look at whether it really
makes sense to do that in postscript, though.

I don't really know how fonts work in windows. Clearly this would only be
an improvement for output using the ps fonts.

I'm sorry that I gave the impression that I don't appreciate the work that
has gone into R. I really think it is a great program. It is just so close
to solving all the data analysis and plotting problems that I have had
that I am hopeful that a few small modifications could bring it the rest
of the way. I will look further at what changes would need to be made, but
I am a newbie to R, so I have a lot to learn.

With me quickly getting there this morning ...

I had asked about multiple version (and also platform) support several
times during the past few years, and had always been told that this was
not necessary.  So why does this keep coming up?

One can add a version layer, but one has to do this right.  Patterning
after the Emacs model is wrong.  Binary incompatabilities were pointed
out, so

	PREFIX/lib/R/VERSION
	PREFIX/lib/R/site

is not good enough.  Emacs has added [the equivalent of]

	PREFIX/lib/R/site/VERSION

but that requires external control of version dependency at install
time.  We actually have the required info through the DESCRIPTION db,
hence could take care of this.

But the effort is really only worth it when one is interested in having
different versions installed at the same time.  Otherwise, you can
always do

	make install
	(cd PREFIX/lib; mv R R-VERSION)

yourself.

Developers, as PD says, typically rely on running their development
version from BUILDDIR.  Otoh, this is wrong because they could end up
with an incompatible add-on package in the site tree.  And we are back
to the long-made decision that God did not want us to run multiple R
versions at the same time.

The code you suggested adding is level-2 PostScript and does not work on
my office printer, for example.  So, yes, it would break things.  This is
why such code is the preserve of a Document Manager in the print spooling
system in Adobe's model.

R follows the recommendations of the PostScript Language Reference Manual
(Appendix G, to be precise).  Looks like StarOffice and GIMP *on your Linux
installation* do not.

Instinctively, I don't think we want to go there... Wouldn't one end
up with (the equivalent of)

Um, I did that once and the walls came tumblin' down... (Or rather, I
tried to move the existing install out of the way before installing a
new one.) You also need to fixup the R_HOME_DIR variable in the R
script as Beebe mentioned.

Er, how?

IF we drop the "easy package migration" aspect and just let people do
separate installs with separate generation of site libraries, would we
not be in the clear? There's also an issue with private libraries of
course. Versioning those would put some administrative burden on the
end user, but could we not adapt an "if it breaks, you get to keep
both pieces" policy?

In all other cases the $v component is a matrix. Also, the $u component

It's the famous `programmer bug' of not using  `` , drop = FALSE ''
when matrix subscripting in functions....

in the 2nd-to-last line of svd() :

    if(nv && nv < p) z$v <- z$v[, 1:nv, drop = FALSE]

I think "easy package migration"  is a great objective, but I expect it is a serious
constraint sometimes. In some respects, as a user, reliable is more important. It is
easier to expect that you always have to re-build packages then to expect you don't
need to and then get surprised sometimes.  There are whole operating systems
dedicated to showing that "easy" can be very difficult when it doesn't work.

Please keep in mind that the problems don't always come just with different R
versions. I'm currently using two systems (Solaris 5.6 and 5.8)  with a shared nfs
file system and I find that R built on 5.8 does not work on 5.6.

(Also, please keep in mind that R is not always installed by someone with root
priveleges.)

Message-ID: <OFC33AA95D.63C7CD15-ON85256A5E.004E396D@rtp.epa.gov>

I first noticed this in gnls, but it also happens in lm, so I suspect the
following phenomenon is universal in modeling functions.  Modify the
example from the lm help:

model <- as.formula(weight ~ group)
lm(model)

The result will be printed:

> lm(model)

Call:
lm(formula = model)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Coefficients:
(Intercept)     groupTrt
      5.032       -0.371

This is because in lm, (where the return value is z) z$call is set to cl,
and cl <- match.call().

My question is:  would it break things to add the line

cl[["formula"]] <- formula
after
cl <- match.call()
?

The result of this is:

> lm.new(model)

Call:
lm.new(formula = weight ~ group)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Coefficients:
(Intercept)     groupTrt
      5.032       -0.371

It would.  Think about how update() works.

What's wrong with

lm(weight ~ group)

or if you need it

eval(substitute(lm(model), model=model))

?  There is a difference between capturing the formula or using a
reference to a formula.

Are you sure we have the right info? We know if a package is
source-incompatible with old versions of R but we may not know if it is
binary-incompatible with new versions.  I was surprised to find that
survival seems to be binary-incompatible between 1.2.3 and 1.3.0 -- at
least, several bugs went away when I recompiled with pre1.3.0

Subject: [Rd] R-1.2.3 OSF precompiled binary doesn't run under DU4.0D (PR#964)
Message-ID: <200106011547.RAA03073@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Paul Mather
Version: 1.2.3
OS: Digital Unix 4.0D
Submission from: (NULL) (128.173.35.237)


The precompiled binary for "osf4.0" distributed via CRAN does not run under
Digital Unix 4.0.  The error given is:

Fatal error: The X11 shared library could not be loaded.
  The error was dlopen: cannot load /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R_X11.so

Subsequent investigation actually reveals that the R_X11.so was linked against
libdnet.so, which is not present on standard Digital Unix 4.0D systems.  The
error is triggered by an inability to load the libdnet.so shared library.

As I understand it, libdnet provides DECnet support.  Digital Unix 4.0D systems
ship with libdnet_stub.so, which is a library of empty stub functions.

Is it possible to provide a version of R_X11.so linked against libdnet_stub.so?
Aside from this problem, the precompiled binary appears to work (i.e.,
"R -g none" runs).

Cheers,

Paul.

Subject: [Rd] Unified naming for R<system>_tmpnam possible?
Message-ID: <3b17e6bf.thoffman.zappa@zappa.sax.de>

What is the reason that the system specific files (sys-unix.c et.al.) all define a specific
name for building tmpfile?

In main/devPS.c then there is an #ifdef sequence which calls depending on the
system defined the respective function.

Wouldn't it be better just to have one function R_tmpnam(), which is implemented
system dependent in the sys-<system>.c files?

Subject: [Rd] What is the logic behind sys-common, sys-unix et.al. ?
Message-ID: <3b17f4a4.thoffman.zappa@zappa.sax.de>

I try to understand how the system specifics are organised in R.

My understanding was that (citing system.txt):

 *	sys-common.c  has code common to the unix/gnome/gnuwin32 ports
 *	sys-unix.c    has code common to the unix/gnome ports
 *	system.c      has interface-specific code

But now I see that unix/sys-common contains unix and Win32 specific code which is selected via
#ifdefs. 

Another question is who carries the sys-common file? If it is "common", why does a specific
system subdir (unix, that is) carry this file? 

I know that there are historical reasons for that, but is there a "plan" for reorganising this stuff, now 
that there is at least a third class of systems (macintosh) involved?

Another question is: Should the graphics interfaces be connected to the systems in a 1:1 fashion?
I have a test build of R-1.2.3 for OS/2 an my hard disk which is able to use a Presentation Manager
and a X11 graphics device: X11 is a 1:1 copy of the unix/X11 files. (And I assume "that new Macs" I
do not know anything about can display X11, too. And for Win32 exist X11 servers ...)

Yes, now there is a Macintosh maintainer that had occurred to some of us.

However, as this is not part of the R API, I don't see this is of any
interest except to R-core, and changing things that work is not a high
priority.

We do not support X11 on Windows, even though it can be built.

No need to give up so quickly!

First, there could be an option for postscript level in the PS driver.  Adobe
acrobat reader, staroffice, etc. have an option like this, where you can
select level 1, 2, 3.  People who have a level 1 printer, could just select
level 1 output.

Secondly, you can use a "protected" setpagedevice call that will work on both
level 1 and level 2 printers.  It looks something like this:

/setpagedevice where { pop << /param value ...  >> setpagedevice } if

The 'where' command will return false if setpagedevice isn't defined, and thus
it setpagedevice will never get called.

It's not just those programs.  Lots of applications will output setpagedevice
commands to control paper size, duplex, etc.  It's usually the ones with more
comprehensive postscript support, that have these features.

I've never seen such a program on Solaris, which comes with a conformant
Document Manager as part of its spool system.

That other programs choose to take over the role of Document Manager is
no reason for R to do so.    These cludges are common in the Windows world,
and it is probably no coincidence that the programs you mention are
all versions of of copies of Windows programs.

Have you checked Sun's star office under solaris?  I just checked framemaker
under solaris, and it does output paper size commands.  But I gather that this
doesn't really matter to you.

Thankfully R is open source, so I will just add it myself.  You're solaris has
a document manager, so screw you attitude isn't very helpfull.  Just one more
patch I will have to apply to new versions.

Dear package author,

We are still accepting submissions for the second issue of the R
Newsletter.  For more information see

      http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/

If you are the author of a package on CRAN and you would like to promote
it a little bit, or if you simply have an interesting application using
R, we hope you can find some time to write a short article on it.  We
suggest that it be approximately 2 pages or less.  The idea of the
newsletter is that it be interesting to R users without being too
technical.  For example an article describing a package could begin by
briefly outlining the statistical background and go on to demonstrate
the usage on some typical data set.  Of course graphics are more than
welcome!

Bill Venables is also encouraging submissions to the more specialist
Programmer's Niche column.  In this case the technical level could be a
little higher, of course, but not necessarily: ingeniousness is the key.

Instructions for authors can be found in ``Writing Articles for R News''
in the first issue of Rnews; more detailed instructions will shortly be
available on the web page.  Remember that submissions have to be in
LaTeX, and that graphics are preferred in PDF or EPS format.  (Bitmaps
like JPG are also OK but please keep in mind that those cannot be scaled
easily and hence might look ugly in the final version.)

The deadline for submissions is

	 June 13, 2001

Keep the contributions rolling in!

Subject: [Rd] update.packages() and parse(text="A B") (PR#966)
Message-ID: <200106031334.PAA07820@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi!

I just used the following command on our NT-Server:

  update.packages()
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : parse error

The problem is caused by the package gregmisc:

  x <- CRAN.packages()
  x[which(x == "gregmisc"),]

   Package    Version   Priority     Bundle    Depends 
"gregmisc"    "0.1.3"       "NA"       "NA"       "R " 


The error occurs in the line

  z[k] <- eval(parse(text = comptext))

in package.dependencies(), because in this case is:

  comptext
[1] "\"1.2.3\"  \"R \""


Best regards,
Uwe Ligges

This is a known problem with gregmisc already reported to maintainer and
fixed on my server (so it will propagate to CRAN shortly).  An update
to gregmisc is promised shortly.

Something similar happens on Unix (which is where I spotted it).  I
think you need to REMOVE gregmisc to fix it.

Yes.  What a nightmare.

[We potentially have control over this, though, through the Depends info
in the package DESCRIPTION dbs.  E.g., update.packages() could try to
organize packages with R version dependencies into version-dependent
subdirs.  But again: suppose pkg A depends on R version B and package B
which may be available but need another version of R.  So we may need
the version of package B for the same version of R etc etc ...]

I think we are much better off with the current `always take the most
current one' approach.

Of course.  But then how do you invoke R?  You either follow Emacs and
have

	R-1.2.3
	R-1.3.0

in your PATH somewhere, or you have a command line option for setting
the version.  And then we're back to the above, worrying about (mostly
binary but not necessarily so; what if there is a change in the
documentation system?) version dependencies in your site tree.

See above.  You're saying `tell everyone that they can do FOO to get
multiple version trees but then they're on their own'.  And then we get
all kinds of bug reports ...

Well ... at greatest generality one could support multiple versions of R
for multiple platforms in the same tree.  E.g., via

	R_HOME/VERSION/share
	R_HOME/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM
	R_HOME/VERSION/library/PKG/R
	R_HOME/VERSION/library/PKG/libs/PLATFORM

etc etc.  Again, long time ago it was decided not to have this.  

> (Also, please keep in mind that R is not always installed by someone

Right.  But the above could be applied to all library trees, at least.

Interesting.  I thought this would not be the case.  What you say is
that a package may claim it only needs R 1.2.2 but this might not run
under R 1.3.0 if compiled under R 1.2.2?

But version incompatibilities go beyond binary incompatibilties.  So
even if we have the info I am not sure what to do.

Hmm... nlme stopped working for me somewhere in the 1.2.2-patched
series. I'm not altogether sure why, but I might have recompiled R to
use ATLAS somewhere along the road. Not that there's any reason to try
and figure out exactly what happened, but it reminded me that things
like compiler and library setup might also be changed between
versions.

Good point.  A reconfigured system might very well break things ...

Subject: [Rd] boxplot.stats() returns wrong value for n (PR#967)
Message-ID: <200106041729.TAA11328@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Gregory R. Warnes
Version: R 1.2.3
OS: Linux (debian test)
Submission from: (NULL) (192.77.198.200)



The documentation for boxplot.stats() states that the 
element "n" of the return list is "the number of of 
non-`NA' observations in the sample.".  However, 
boxplot.stats() currently returns the total number 
of observations instead. 

Example:

> boxplot.stats( c(1:10,rep(NA,10) ) )

$stats
[1]  1.0  3.0  5.5  8.0 10.0

$n
[1] 20

$conf
[1] 3.733506 7.266494

$out
numeric(0)

The problem is the statement 

  n <- length(nna) # including +/- Inf

in boxplot.stats().  It should be

  n <- sum(nna) # including +/- Inf

Correcting this line yields:

> boxplot.stats( c(1:10,rep(NA,10) ) )
$stats
[1]  1.0  3.0  5.5  8.0 10.0

$n
[1] 10

$conf
[1] 3.001801 7.998199

$out
numeric(0)

Dear R,

I would like to report what I think is a bug in R.  I am running R
within emacs on a Digital AlphaStation.  See the version information
at the end of my R session for details.  I also attach a copy of the
file that is read in the `read.table' command.

Here's my R session, with a few comments added in to show what I
think is wrong:

You could very well be tickling a memory bug, but that version of R is
more than a year out of date and things have changed considerably in
the meantime. Could you please retry with a more recent version? 

And, BTW, large attachments are quite difficult to extract once they
have been mangled by the mailing list and bug filing software, so only
use them as a last resort. It's much preferable if you put it up
separately on your homepage or FTP site.

Subject: [Rd] error in make install-info (PR#969)
Message-ID: <200106051743.TAA16230@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi 
I'm installing R with the standard commands:

        ./configure
        make
	make check 
        make dvi        to create DVI versions
        make pdf        to create PDF versions
        make info       to create info files
 
        make install
        make install-dvi
        make install-info
        make install-pdf
     
Everything works fine apart from "make install-info":

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@fyb012000002 /home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev]# make install-info

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev/doc/manual'
make: [install-info] Error 2 (ignored)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens from R-1.2.3 (and previous) as well as for R-devel (1.3.0).
Anything to worry about (it seens harmless)?

Thanks

In the devel snapshot from this morning a previously saved workspace (.RData) does
not get loaded. (If that is a new feature I missed it in the NEWS file.)

It's likely caused by

/doc/manual/Makefile:  @$(MKINSTALLDIRS) -p $(infodir)

in which I suspect that one can safely lose the "-p" since
mkinstalldirs obviously doesn't know what to do with it...

BTW we seem to be alternately using $(MKINSTALLDIRS) and
$(top_srcdir)/tools/mkinstalldirs for this purpose. Anyone have a clue
on whether this ought to be standardized?

Indeed! 
I've removed the "-p" and it worked well.

Thanks for spotting this.  The `-p' is wrong.  Removed now.

Yes, of course.  We use the latter in the add-on package Makefiles.
These do not include $(top_builddir)/Makeconf where MKINSTALLDIRS is
defined.  I think we can safely stay with the current solution.

Best,

Hm. Doesn't happen with 1.2.3 on Linux and dbeta.c hasn't changed
inbetween. Any chance of getting you to step through the computations
with a debugger on you machine?

It does happen on Solaris 2.7, though, which might give Peter a means
to look at it on an earlier Solaris.

Indeedy. Looks like we're passing a-1 and a+b-2 on to dbinom_raw as x
and n respectively and this comes out with x > n due to roundoff so we
get zero returned.

Argh, how does one fix that?

(It's usually the intel FPUs that pull that kind of stunt on us...)

Subject: [Rd] unsigned char?
Message-ID: <20010607131044I.uebayasi@soum.co.jp>

Hello,

Just a curiosity, is there any reason that R's string is not 'unsigned
char *' but 'char *'?

TIA,
Masao

Subject: [Rd] Bug list summary (automatic post)
Message-ID: <200106070515.HAA24878@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

R-devel anyway.

That X server has DPS and type 1 scaleable fonts including for Helvetica.
The X11 device chooses fonts by

devX11.c:static char *fontname_R6 =
"-adobe-helvetica-%s-%s-*-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*

and if the X server does not have Adobe Helvetica in the specified size
etc one would need to look at exactly what it does give you.  My
Solaris one will have Adobe Helvetica in the right encoding.

Actually, that's an S/S incompatibility:

S-PLUS : Copyright (c) 1988, 1996 MathSoft, Inc.
S : Copyright AT&T.
Version 3.4 Release 1 for Sun SPARC, SunOS 5.3 : 1996 
Working data will be in .Data 
cbind(data.frame(x=1,y=2), data.frame(x=4,u=3))
  x y x u 
1 1 2 4 3

(We might of course still want to follow the more recent S-PLUS,
although perhaps not put too draconian measures in to keep names
unique.)

Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.33.0106071439180.48906-100000@homer17.u.washington.edu>


The AIX build of the development version isn't quite working due to a
problem in the automatic symbol extraction process.

Compilation of R itself goes fine, but then in the script tools/ldAIX4
doesn't extract the symbols from arithmetic.o.  This is because
  bash-2.01$ nm arithmetic.o
  nm: arithmetic.o: 0654-206 Cannot process the symbol table.

As a result, R_finite is not exported and the vfonts module cannot be
built.  If the necessary symbols are added by hand to etc/R.exp then the
rest of the build proceeds normally.

Compiling arithmetic.c doesn't produce any errors (gcc) and the symbol
table problem doesn't seem to happen for any other object file.

Any ideas?

Not really.  Which nm is that, the native one or from GNU binutils?

Subject: [Rd] Generalising object.size
Message-ID: <3B208DC1.4947887E@durham.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Currently (R-1.2.3) object.size called with an environment tells you the
size of the environment handle but not the size of the sum of the
objects contained within the environment.  Is anyone but me interested
in the following simple generalisation:

"object.size" <- function (x, expand.envir = FALSE)
{
  if (expand.envir && is.environment(x)) {
    s <- 0
    for (i in ls(envir=x))
      s <- s + Recall(get(i, envir=x))
    s
  } else
    .Internal(object.size(x))
}

> fred <- new.env()
> assign("letters", letters, envir=fred)
> assign("numbers", 1:10, envir=fred) 
> object.size(fred)
[1] 28
> object.size(fred, TRUE)
[1] 408

As an aside, I had to use a for-loop here because Recall does not work
inside a sapply:

	sum(sapply(ls(envir=x), function(i) Recall(get(i, envir=x))))

causes an infinite recursion because the wrong function gets
"Recall"-ed.  Is there any way around this?

Cheers, Jonathan.

Subject: [Rd] update.packages fails again (PR#972)
Message-ID: <200106082025.WAA20114@pubhealth.ku.dk>

It's happened again:

exactRankTests_0.4-2.tar.gz has

Depends: R > 1.3.0

which is not only impossible, but breaks update.packages.

How can we test for this?

Unfortunately once such a package is installed, it has to be manually
uninstalled before update.packages will work again.

*PLEASE* can people read the manual to get the syntax right: it is

Depends: R (>= 1.3.0)

but such packages should not be in the main part of CRAN yet.

yes.  What changed from r-release to r-devel is how the endianness
flags, hw and lw, are handled.  Get rid of the const or the static
keyword, and arithmetic.c compiles and nm can read the symbol table.
Looks like a compiler/assembler bug to me...

Suggestion until 'static const int' works in AIX: Change around line 87:

#ifndef _AIX
#  ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
static const int hw = 0;
static const int  lw = 1;
#  else  /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
static const int hw = 1;
static const int lw = 0;
#  endif /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#else
        /* 'static const int' doesn't work on AIX */
#  ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
static int hw = 0;
static int  lw = 1;
#  else  /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
static int hw = 1;
static int lw = 0;
#  endif /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#endif

Above compiles, links, etc. for me with r-devel from today.


> Not really.  Which nm is that, the native one or from GNU binutils?

I had the problems with the native one.  I don't have the GNU binutils
installed.

I'll check this after my build with the native cc/f77 finishes (it takes
about four hours).  It doesn't look as though the native compilers have
this problem -- it's got as far as the help pages, which are the slowest
part.

Subject: [Rd] Add smooth curves with panel.superpose
Message-ID: <200106090111.LAA01097@leonard.anu.edu.au>

I propose an extesion of the settings available for the
type parameter in panel.superpose(), thus:

type if "p" points are plotted, if "l", the points are 
  joined by lines, if "b" there are points and lines,
  if "s" there are points and a smooth fitted curve,
  if "S" there is a curve.

Example:

library(mass)
data(cabbages)
xyplot(HeadWt~VitC|Date, panel=panel.superpose,
   groups=Cult, data=cabbages, type="s",span=2)
xyplot(HeadWt~VitC|Date, panel=panel.superpose,
   groups=Cult, data=cabbages, type="s",span=2)

Here is the altered code.  The changes are in the statements
          if (type == "p" || type == "b"||type=="s"){ ....}
and the new code:
                if ((type=="s"||type=="S")&&is.finite(x[id])&&
		         is.finite(y[id])){
                    span <- list(...)$span
                    if(is.null(span))span <- 2/3
                    iter <- list(...)$iter
                    if(is.null(iter))iter <- 3
                    xy <-   lowess(x[id], y[id], f = span, iter = iter)

Damn it.  I thought that my Perl code in R CMD check

    if($description->{"Depends"} =~ /\bR *\([^)]*\)/) {
        ## The `Depends' field is not required, and currently only R
        ## version dependencies are used, which must be of the form
        ## `R ($op $version)' with `$op' one of `<=' or `>='.
        $log->checking("DESCRIPTION Depends field");
        $description->{"Depends"} =~ /\bR *\(([^) ]+) *([^) ]+)\)/;
        if((($1 eq "<=") || ($1 eq ">=")) && $2) {
            $log->result("OK");
        }
        else {
            $log->warning();
            $log->message("  malformed Depends field");
        }
    }

was good enough.  It is intended to check for just that: even more
precisely for exactly what is used by R lateron.

For the offending package I get no warning.  Argh.

How can this be installed?  I though if you ran R CMD INSTALL then it
would figure this out.  At least, this is what

  depends=`get_dcf_field Depends DESCRIPTION`
  depends=`echo ${depends} | grep 'R *('`
  if test "${depends}"; then
    depends=`echo ${depends} | sed 's/.*R *(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/;s/=/= /'`
    dep_operator=`set - ${depends}; echo ${1}`
    dep_version=`set - ${depends}; echo ${2}`
    ## Currently, only operators `<=' and `>=' are supported.  Hence we
    ## check this, and also whether we found a version string.
    if (test "${dep_operator}" = "<=" \
        || test "${dep_operator}" = ">=") \
        && test -n "${dep_version}"; then
      dep_ok=`expr ${R_VERSION} ${dep_operator} ${dep_version} `
      if test ${dep_ok} -eq 0; then
        echo "ERROR: This R is version ${R_VERSION}"
        echo "       package \`${pkg}' depends on R ${dep_version}"
        exit 1;
      fi
    else
      echo "WARNING: malformed \`Depends' field in \`DESCRIPTION'"
    fi
  fi

in INSTALL is supposed to do.  Same problem, most likely.

Will have a look later.

I'm sorry! exactRankTests_0.4-4.tar.gz is now in incoming and

Subject: [Rd] documentation and \sloppy (PR#976)
Message-ID: <200106102050.WAA26838@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi
When preparing documentation using Rd2dvi sometimes we get "overflow" on
some lines. The consequence is that in the documentation there are some
lines where words are not hyphenated or moved. The final document has some
lines with more columns than the rest of the text. 
This happens when we use \code{} (which probably calls the \tt in latex).

I've been checking the documentation (.pdf files) of a few packages  and
this seens to occours all over.

One possible way to correct this is  by introducing the command
\sloppy
on the header of the automatically generated .tex files. It seens to work
fine in some tests I've run.

I'm wondering whether the "\sloppy" can be incorporated to the Rd2dvi
command. 

Cheers
P.J.

Subject: [Rd] Additional output in cancor
Message-ID: <3B247F91.CAD6F5E4@durham.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Can I suggest an additional output component in cancor, from package
mva?  It would be useful to have the number of canonical correlation
vectors, equivalently the rank of the covariance between x and y (label
"rank").  This would usually be min(dx, dy), where dx and dy have
already been computed for the svd function, but there might be
situations where it was less than this, so I guess the safe option would
be to include

	rank = qr(t(x) %*% y)$rank

among the outputs.  Then the last four lines of the help might be
amended to

     rk <- cxy$rank
     all.equal(cor(x %*% cxy$xcoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE],
       y %*% cxy$ycoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(cxy$cor))
     all.equal(cor(x %*% cxy$xcoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(1, rk))
     all.equal(cor(y %*% cxy$ycoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(1, rk))

which I think is more intuitive.

More radically, the xcoef and ycoef components of cancor might
themselves be restricted to the appropriate columns (1:rank).  This
might affect some existing code, although any code that uses the
non-informative columns has got to be broken, hasn't it?!

Can I also suggest an extra reference for the help page:

Oh, great timing!   R went into feature-freeze last night for 1.3.0.
No new features until 1.4.0 in December or whatever comes next.

Nope.  It's rare, but needing to span the orthocomplement can happen.

I'd say that was inferior to Seber (and I find it rather confusing).

Small new features have been known to slip into the patch releases
though, but if there's *any* chance of getting something wrong, we
should not include it during feature freeze, however little it might
seem. Changing arguments and result components must be off-limits by
principle, if only because the effort invested in ensuring that they
are harmless would be better spent on fixing known bugs.

Yes it can, using the Rd.cfg mechanism.  If there is a file Rd.cfg in your
TEXINPUTS path, it gets read at the bottom of Rd.sty.  This should allow
you to change the TeX penalties (which is what \sloppy does AFAIR).

I think Rd2dvi is intended only to be a simple mechanism to produce
a reasonable printed manual, but the Rd.cfg mechanism allows some
customization.  My view is that a few overlaps into the right margin is
less distracting that the `loose' typesetting that \sloppy encourages.

To my inverted way of thinking there is something wrong with the general
logic of what is being attempted here.

I think people should be encouraged to upgrade to the most recent
released version of R. At best I test my packages with the last two
releases of R, so it is only by accident that the "Depends" line on my
packages may not specify the most recent release.

On the other hand, an unmaintained package could quickly depend on an
older version of R. I don't see any way a package maintainer can specify
this, but there could be some mechanism (possible tied to passing R CMD
check) that specifies dependency on an older version of R. Perhaps this
might also be formally recognized as a mechanism for moving things out
of the contrib section of CRAN.  If this is to be written into a file in
the package it would require modifying the contents of the tar ball, but
if it could be coded into a prefix on the package name it might be
simpler?

The logic is to allow packages to depend on unreleased versions, or
known new features (only in x.y.0 releases, of course ...).

It's useful for the >=1.3.0 versions around at present, and of course
as an encouragement to upgrade.

Yes, but the problem is that building a package now, say for 1.3.0,
who  knows whether one should specify

Depends: R (< 2.0)
or
Depends: R (< 3.0)

And when those versions come along the maintainer may not be around to
make the change to the Depends line. (An if they were they would
probably update the package instead.)

Yes, a < depends should almost never be correct. However, changing it to a
prefix doesn't help with this.  About the only situation when this would
apply is if we decide to break source compatibility  (eg to put threads
in). Here the CRAN maintainers will know what the dependency is, but it
may not be fixed immediately.

We don't want the depends to mean "was only tested with". It should mean
"will not work without". In most cases only the package maintainer can
distinguish between a bug (which may be exposed more clearly by a new
version of R)  and a valid dependency.

Actually, a `<' never is.  Only `<=' and `>=' are allowed, according to
the docs.

We have an informal mechanism of moving old versions into version
specific ``old'' subdirs.  Here's what happens.  When a new release
comes along I test all packages (argh) against the new version.  The
ones that do not pass R CMD check for the new version will be moved out
to the `old' subdirs, unless a new version comes along (in which case
they are stored somewhere else).

At least, this was the old way.  Now that we actually have an archive of
old packages, we maybe should put them in there as well and record the
last version they were known to work with somewhere else.  (Or change
the DESCRIPTION Depends info accordingly?)

Argh.

Subject: [Rd] R-devel on alpha Tru64: cxml/dxml problem (PR#977)
Message-ID: <200106111812.UAA09885@pubhealth.ku.dk>



Hi,

I just run a ./configure --enable-R-shlib; make; make check; with a recent
(11.6.2001) R-devel snapshot on Tru64 4.0F (with libcxml):

make check stops in base-Ex.R at:

> ###--- >>> `plot.window' <<<----- Set up World Coordinates for Graphics
Window>
>       ## alias         help(plot.window)

Error in La.eigen(Tmat, symmetric = TRUE) :
        On entry to DSYEV  parameter number 8 had an illegal value
Execution halted

The problem is, that by default the accelerated blas library (libdxml or
libcxml) is found by ./configure and gets used (DSYEV resides in this
library) 

I stopped using libdxml/libcxml with R long ago because I had similar
problems (using libdxml on Tru64 4.0E) with some of my libraries, but I
thought it was my fault. The interesting thing is, that some of the dxml
functions are useable, some not.

Now I took a closer look and recognized that libdxml/libcxml are linked
with the DEC/Compaq Fortran runtime libraries:

agebhard@alpha4-stat[R-devel]$ odump -Dl /usr/shlib/libcxml.so

                        ***LIBRARY LIST SECTION***
        Name             Time-Stamp        CheckSum   Flags Version

        libc.so      Jun 12 20:14:23 2000 0xbad758ae     0 osf.1

I guess because we are using gcc/g77 and not DEC cc/f77 we cannot use
CXML/DXML libraries.

And indeed, make check succeeds with "--without-blas" added to the
configure options.

Solution:

I would suggest to modify the configure script not to use dxml/cxml on
alpha-tru64 by default.

TL>We don't want the depends to mean "was only tested with". It should
mean
TL>"will not work without".

I guess this is where I was confused. I was thinking that depends should
indicate to a user that the version of a package and version(s) of R
have been tested together. "Have been tested together" seems like useful
information for a user, but I guess the real philosophy on that is that
a user should get the latest release R and the latest version of a
package from CRAN and these have been tested together (I think).

I think you should promote the "upgrade to the latest version" approach
and not put too much effort into which old versions of packages work
with old versions of R. The depends information which is in a package
will already give people a pretty good clue if they are really desperate
for a package that is no longer being maintained.  My concern was mainly
because I did not at first realize that you already had a mechanism for
moving packages to "old."

R developers: anyone against that?

If not: Albrecht, can you suggest code which fixes the problem?  Should
we turn off checking for dxml/cxml in general?  I'd rather not special
case a specific platform (or even in combo with a specific compiler).

I think we should just remove the checks.  They are run on all platforms
even though only relevant to one, and they can in any case be specified
via -with-blas=foo for some `foo' (cxml or dxml, I think).

> case a specific platform (or even in combo with a specific compiler).

Even though we are in feature free, zapping the following lines in
m4/R.m4 seems innocent enough:

if test "x$BLAS_LIBS" = x; then
  # BLAS in Alpha CXML library?
  AC_CHECK_LIB(cxml, $dgemm_func, BLAS_LIBS="-lcxml", , $FLIBS)
fi

if test "x$BLAS_LIBS" = x; then
  # BLAS in Alpha DXML library? (now called CXML, see above)
  AC_CHECK_LIB(dxml, $dgemm_func, BLAS_LIBS="-ldxml", , $FLIBS)
fi

If we do this, we need to add the info to R-admin.texi.

[Yes.  Plus take not that we modified the macro taken from Octave and
need to talk to JWE about it.]

Dear R Core Team,

I'm wondering whether it is useful that every package should allow 
for help(PackageName), giving some general information about the 
package (more/nicer than library(help=PackageName)). This man page 
may include some mathematical or statistical background, or contain 
a guideline for the package.

Cheers,
Martin

help(nlme) would be ambiguous then. 

help(package=nlme) already works, same as library(help=nlme). 

I suppose we could make it a convention to have each package contain
an Overview entry so that help(Overview, package=nlme) would do what
you want (or even help(Overview, nlme) if we switch the arguments
around), but someone would have to write those pages....

Subject: [Rd] Using konqueror with help.start
Message-ID: <6r8zixwza2.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

For R-1.2.3 on a Debian 2.3 (testing) GNU/Linux system I would like
to have help.start use Konqueror (the KDE web browser) instead of
netscape.  I can start it with

 help.start(browser = "konqueror")

but trying to search for terms from the search page does not work.  

My guess is that I need to configure javascript.  The default is not
to allow javascript at all.  I do not wish to enable javascript
globally.  Under Settings->Configure Konqueror->Javascript I have set
accept for the localhost Host/domain.  This does not seem to help.

Can anyone give instructions on how I can allow searching without
globally enabling javascript?

This is important to me because there is a long-standing wishlist bug
against the Debian r-base package that I could close if I could use
show that Konqueror could be used instead of netscape.

Meanwhile (and with a new help system planned, I mean until that is
onstream), you will find discussion of this topic in the R-devel archives,
and should note that several packages already use INDEX for this purpose.
Try

library(help=boot)

for one.

Hmm ... I raised the issue about help.start() support for browsers other
than netscape a few weeks ago.  I seem to recall that as neither mozilla
(bug) nor konqueror (feature?) can be controlled remotely in the way
netscape does, we decided to not pursue this any further.

It seems that all you want is getting help.start() to work and use the
Java search engine, but what good would this be?  The next help() would
not be able to display HTML output in the same konqueror windows ...

The R help.start() search uses Java and not Javascript. They are
almost nothing to do with each other, and are enabled independently in
Netscape.

Does konqueror have Java support?

If you run help.start using netscape you will see

`Starting Java'

Yes, but even enabling that globally still leaves the R search function
busted as I verified earlier on my work box (using KDE 2.1.* under
Debian 2.3).

Quite a shame because konqueror is my preferred browser. Real pretty
with the anti-aliased fonts.

Subject: [Rd] Memory management problem?
Message-ID: <OF83B710C1.C01800C8-ON86256A69.005C62ED@mmm.com>

I just ran into the following problem.  I am not sure what causes it, but
here is the scenario:

(1) I start R with 512Mb of memory.  (I am on an Win2000 PC with 512Mb of
physical memory)
(2) I put a couple of small functions in my workspace and I generate two
real vectors x and y of length 2^19 (542288) each.
(3) I save this workspace.  The size of the saved file is about 8.4Mb.
(4) I run lm to fit y vs. x using an 11 parameter model.  I generate a
couple of plots.  Everything is fine.  (BTW, this runs out of memory with
standard 256Mb allocation of maximum memory).
(5) I regenerate y (it is a simulated example) overwriting the old one.
(6) I run (4) again and I am getting:
     Error: cannot allocate vector of size 45056kb
     Reached total allocation of 512Mb
      This happens even if I run gc() after (5).
(7) Now comes an interesting part.  If I save the image right now the size
of it is about 159Mb although I do not have any new objects in my workspace
(there is a hidden object .Trace, but it is  small).
(8) If I do
     rm(list=ls(pos=1), pos=1)
      however, the size of the workspace comes back to almost zero.

I am not sure if this happens on Linux since my Linux box only has 192Mb of
memory.

Is this the new memory management problem?  Is there any way around it?

Thanks in advance,

Andy

No, it's an old one, called fragmentation, I expect.  There may be no
free space of size 45Mb, and remember R no longer moves objects.  Also,
the allocation over 256Mb may well be fragmented.

I think you have the solution already: remove objects you are no longer
using.

Or increase the memory allocation to 2Gb: since you have big objects, NT's
virtual memory should do a good job.  That limit is really only there to
avoid paging on small systems, especially ones with VFAT file systems
(you are running NTFS I hope).  You may still get allocation problems.

Subject: [Rd] Preview of rw1030
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0106131724020.1159-100000@gannet.stats>

I've put up at

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/RWin/SetupR.exe

a (15Mb) `release candidate' of rw1030.  It's a snapshot of the complete
release but not everything (especially the recommended packages) is in
final form.

I would particularly be interested in feedback on two points:

1) The claim is that utilities like Rcmd check now work on 16-bit versions
of Windows.  Certainly with the latest perl (626) I was able to do all I
tested, including installing and checking bundles, on Windows 98.

2) There are inbuilt capabilities to download files (and more), and
update.packages() can be run from a menu.  Does this work on old low-end
systems?  If not, does the alternative given in CHANGES work?

Also on anything else ... we will be doing more checking before release.

Subject: [Rd] expand.model.frame() fails when subset is specified (PR#979)
Message-ID: <200106141815.UAA16660@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Gregory R. Warnes
Version: 1.2.0, 1.2.3
OS: SunOS gsun124 5.8 Generic_108528-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
Submission from: (NULL) (12.18.36.49)


When using expand.model.frame on a model that specifies a subset selection, 
an error is generated on the variable used for the subset selection.  

Example:

> data <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10,z=1:10,m=1:10)
> model <- lm( y ~ x, data=data, subset=m<8)
> expand.model.frame(model, ~ z)
Error in [.data.frame(structure(list(y = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,  : 
        Object "m" not found

The patch below uses "eval" and "call" with the appropriate
environment instead of calling model.frame directly. This results in:

> source("/home/warneg/R-src/R-1.2.3/src/library/base/R/expand.model.frame.R")
> expand.model.frame(model, ~ z)
  y x z
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5
6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7

Thanks. This is also present in the current pre-1.3.0. Your patch
looks correct, but I wonder if the default for "enclos" should not be
environment(formula(model)) rather than parent.frame() as it is now?

(And wouldn't it be better named "envir"?)

Peter,

I was merely making an incremental improvement, your suggestions provide
additional improvements.   Go right ahead and make the changes.  [This seems
wierd, are you asking 
me, non-R-core person that I am, permission to make changes to the R source
code?]

Just for illustration, here's an example of why it is better to use  
environment(formula(model)) rather than parent.frame():

	> fun <- function() {
	+ data <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10,z=1:10,m=1:10)
	+ model <- lm( y ~ x, data=data, subset=m<8)
	+ model
	}

	> test <- fun()
	> 

With my version:

	> expand.model.frame(test, ~ z )
	Error in as.data.frame.default(data) : can't coerce function into a
data.frame

With the additional changes:

	> test  <-  fun()
	> expand.model.frame(test, ~ z )
	  y x z
	1 1 1 1
	2 2 2 2
	3 3 3 3	
	4 4 4 4
	5 5 5 5
	6 6 6 6
	7 7 7 7

Pretty nifty.  

-Greg

Subject: [Rd] read.xport() bug (PR#981)
Message-ID: <200106142225.AAA17768@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Aimee Teo Broman
Version: 1.23
OS: Windows 98
Submission from: (NULL) (162.129.145.115)


When I use the read.xport() function in the foreign library, the Rgui shuts
down.   My xport file was created in SAS ver.6, using the xport engine in proc
copy. 

R commands:
1. library(foreign)
2. lookup.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this works fine.
3. read.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this produces a window that says "This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down."  The details are shown
below:

RGUI caused an invalid page fault in
module FOREIGN.DLL at 017f:14c727e7.
Registers:
EAX=00000000 CS=017f EIP=14c727e7 EFLGS=00010246

Bytes at CS:EIP:
c6 00 00 83 c4 fc 83 c4 10 39 d8 75 09 a1 48 02 
Stack dump:
034a1320 00000020 034b5a50 78037ce8 02c5cf68 00000002 0270f4ac 004250ae 00585140
02c5c728 0270f46c 00000079 00000001 0348c150 0348e9d0 78037ce8 

The date on the foreign.zip file is 18-May-2001, so I believe I have the most
recent version of both R and the foreign package.  I would call this an
intermittant problem, except that I have this problem more frequently than not.
Yesterday it was working, but today it is shutting down the gui again.  Any help
would be appreciated.

thanks much,
Aimee Broman

Sorry, I might have made that more clear. Followups on bug reports get
CC'ed into R-bugs and stored with the original report, as well as
circulated via R-devel. I was just making a note for whoever might have
a better informed opinion than myself, as well as for the person who'll
get around to putting in the fix eventually (which might well be
myself).

All packages have a version number, in their DESCRIPTION file or via

package.description("foreign")$Version

I suspect this is 0.4-3, but please confirm.

We do need a reproducible example to make any sense of this bug report, and
for that we need fdt.tpt.  Could you please attach that file to your reply.

Subject: [Rd] R CMD check (PR#982)
Message-ID: <200106151929.VAA27886@pubhealth.ku.dk>

In revising the splancs package, I use R CMD check. After a number of
changes to various files in the directory tree, R CMD check fails at the
* checking for undocumented objects ... ERROR
stage as shown below. But running undoc() in R (pointed at the Rcheck
directory, not on the older version) doesn't show the same error, and grep
on the Rcheck R code finds the function. I ran undoc() under debug() too,
to be sure that it was looking in the Rcheck location, not the default
library.

PS: Specifically I was responding to Kurt's note re:
$as.points
$as.points$code
[1] "..."
$as.points$docs
[1] "p"
and doing work on documentation as well. as.points is (...) in both code
and docs now. Is it the ellipsis that is the problem?

Can you put a snapshot of what you have into CRAN's incoming area?

the perl version check in the configurte script

clearly fails, but e.g.

Finally

Sorry, this was my fault, I mixed up R-devel.tar.gz with a very old
version laying around in my RPM_SOURCE Directory, ... I should have used
the version from my home dir.

Hi,
two small typos in `?write.table' (R 1.2.3)

In the doc of the append parameter:

 append: logical. If true, the output is appended to targshe file.
that should be "... to the file".

and in the Details section, a full-stop is missing after names:

  Normally there is no column name for a column of row names If

Cheers,
Stephen

Apparently, both of those got fixed on the 1.3.0 branch a couple of
months ago. (Before the release of 1.2.3, in fact...)

Thanks anyway. It's nice to have people looking out for this kind of
problems.

There was no Macintosh device when it was written, and when it was
re-implemented this was not changed.

Implemented for 1.3.0.

Subject: [Rd] approxfun(*, ties=) returning "random" result (PR#986)
Message-ID: <200106181035.MAA09201@pubhealth.ku.dk>

  Platforms  : SunOS and Linux, both using gcc 2.95.[23]
  R versions : 1.2.3 and "R-devel"

I came accross this when trying to debug a somewhat sub-optimal behavior of
ecdf() from package stepfun.
What happens is that  approxfun(*, ties = <function>)
does not always return the same result for identical arguments.
I tried "min", "max", and "mean" all of which are mentioned on the help page.
>From looking at both R and C code, I wonder if the bug is not even deep
inside where .C(......) is handled, or somewhere else ``deep down''...

I could debug more myself, but given the ``immediate release'' and my
limited resources, I'll pass this on :

###---------- the following is executable; read and follow the comments

n <- length(xt <- c(.4,.4,.4,1,1.05,2,3,3,3.4, 4,4,4,4:5, 7,7))

e2 <- approxfun(xt,(1:n)/n, method = "const", yl=0, yr=1, f=0, ties=max)
e2(xt)# all "1" (well mostly...)
gcinfo(TRUE)
## Execute the following (long) line a few times...
## the non-1 solution happens often (not always!) immediately *after* GC..
for(i in 1:100) {ee <- e2(xt);if(!is.na(b <- all(ee == 1)) && b) cat(".") else cat("\n",16*ee,"\n")}

## The problem happens only when  ties = <function>, not for ties = "ordered":
e1 <- approxfun(xt,(1:n)/n, method = "const", yl=0, yr=1, f=0, ties="ordered")
e1xt <- c(3,3,3:6,8,8,9,rep(13,4),14,15,15)/16
stopifnot(e1(xt) == e1xt)

## Execute the following (long) line a few times...
## -- no problem, always "........."
for(i in 1:100) {ee <- e1(xt);if(!is.na(b <- all(ee == e1xt))&& b)cat(".") else cat("\n",16*ee,"\n")}

...but yes, we almost forgot it again. Just goes to show the
advantage of using the bug repository when reporting.

No, the problem is that `n', the length of the x and y vectors, is not
recomputed when the ties are removed.  Thus in your example two 9-element
vectors are passed down to a C routine that is told they are 16 elements
long. Bad.

I'll commit the obvious fix after make check.

I asked Prof. Brian Ripley if I might submit some text/input for the
R-intro writers, he said this is the place to do it.

I was on a plane a couple of weeks ago reading R-intro as I plan for a
course and made these notes, some of which I think will help my students
if you incorporate them.  I've attached a raw text file I wrote in Emacs
to this message "Rintrochanges.txt".

I have written documents like R-intro before and understand it is
difficult to please everybody, and I thank you for your effort on the
project.

R-intro comments/enhancements  Part I.

I think something more verbose like this would help under
"Ordered and Unordered factors"

Texts on research design emphasize that variables have
different levels of measurement. Typically, there are three levels.
If a measurement is taken with a precise scale (one on which it is
meaningful to say new_value = b*old_value, as with readings of a
thermometer), it is considered an "interval" level variable.  Many
statistical models were originally designed for interval level
variables.  If a measurement is not so precise, but only provides an
ordered categorization of observations, such as "low" "medium" and
"high", it is called an ordinal variable.  If a measurement is
categorical and implies no sense of ordering, such as "European",
"Asian", or "South American", then it is typically called an ordinal
variable.  Assigning the values of "1", "2", and "3" to these
observations has no substantive significance, as we might as well
number them "3","2","1".

Many statistical models are designed for interval level data, but with
appropriate recoding of input, they can also be made to work with
nominal and ordinal data.  In the "old days" of statistical computing,
users were forced to create a lot of indicator (or "dummy") variables,
thereby converting information from nominal or ordinal measurements
into variables that have only values 0 and 1.  For example, to
represent the information about the home continents of survey
respondents, we might create two dummy variables, one for Asia (coded
1 if respondent is from Asia, 0 otherwise) and one for South America
(likewise 0 and 1).  A respondent for whom we find both of these dummy
variables equal to 0 is sure to be from Europe, so we don't usually
need to create three dummy variables.  Doing so would be redundant.

With a modern language like R, much of the drudgery of creating the
indicator variables is handled automatically if the user declares the
variables properly.  In R, and S before it, the term "factor" is used
to refer to a variable that is not measured at the interval level. An
"unordered factor" is a nominal (or categorical) variable, while an
"ordered factor" is the term for an ordinal measurement.  Many
statistical procedures in R have builtin procedures for handling
factors.

Beyond handling coding of noninterval variables, factors play a vital
role in many R procedures.  Procedures can be designed to do a chore
for each value of a factor.  Many procedures will in fact insist that
a variable be designated as a factor.

 ------------------


In this section "Named arguments and defaults", I am left in a
confusion about a few things.  This confusion has bothered me a while.
Can you do more to explain which arguments must be specified, which
are optional, and under what conditions is it necessary to include the
parameter= which calling a function.

1.  When I use a function, and I look in its help page, how do I know
which input variables must be declared and which can be ignored?  This
is quite mysterious.  When invocations leave out some arguments, how
does R "sift through" the ones that are provided to know which is
which?


For example, consider the page on "update.packages".  

Under Usage, I find:
update.packages(lib.loc = .lib.loc, CRAN = getOption("CRAN"),
                contriburl = contrib.url(CRAN),
                method = "auto", instlib = NULL,
                ask=TRUE, available=NULL, destdir=NULL)

I've been using computers a long time, and I use this function every two months or so.  Between times I forget, come back to this page, and still this one leaves me totally confused.  

After fiddling a while, I find this works on Linux:
>update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/library",CRAN="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN")

but what bothered me thd most is the "getOption("CRAN") option for CRAN.  I tried many variations on that and never figured how to make it work.


Maybe any clarifications could be related to the section "Getting help with functions and features"

In this section, I think it would be nice to have a paragraph about
"how to read a help page."  Some things are not obvious to all new
users.  Some things in help pages are tough to describe... Maybe I'd
say

How to read a help page.

If you find a help page, notice that it is made up of different parts.

1. "Description". These are usually terse, so read every word
   carefully.

2. Look for the "Value" heading.  That tells you what this procedure is
   going to return when you call it. If this procedure doesn't return
   what you need, you should find out immediately.

3. Under "Usage", most help pages list a number of possible commands
   that can be used.  These are not commands to be typed
   literally. Many of them contain abstract references which provide
   information about the nature of the variables that might be
   entered.  

   Here is a simple case.  The coefficients help page has this:

Usage

coef(object, ...)
coefficients(object, ...)

   Clearly, coef and coefficients are going to do the same thing, and you must supply the appropriate object.

4. Under "Arguments," the help page indicates what inputs this
   procedure wants.  The inputs are described line-by-line, and often
   the comments indicate of parameters are optional or what their
   default value might be.

   Many help pages have the infamous "...", which is something like
   "fill in the appropriately, depending on whatever context you
   find."  In some situations this is easy to understand .  Many help
   pages will eplicitly say that "..." refers to any options that
   might be used with a particular kind of object, and in that case
   one must find the help page for that other object. For example, the
   dev.copy help page clearly indicates that "..." refers to any
   options that might be used with the particular device in question.

   Other help pages are not so informative.  Consider the output from ?coefficients:

Arguments

 object
       an object for which the extraction of model coefficients is meaningful.
 ...
       other arguments.

Here it is clear you need to give a statistical object to have
coefficients removed.  The "..." is a mystery, and most R users will
try to use the coefficients command without worrying about it, and
then backtrack if an error occurs.  And, if an error occurs, there may be no recourse but to read the source code for this command or ask  about it in the r-help email list.

And the bug is?

The generic indexing should really be x[...,drop=T].  Methods for
specific classes can specialize to a particular number of indices if
they want to, which is what is happening here

> get ("[.data.frame")
function (x, i, j, drop = if (missing(i)) TRUE else length(cols) == 
    1) 

one could fairly easily slip in a "..." argument after "j", and then
inside the function give an error if "..." is not empty, but what
would the point be?

The point would be to catch errors like this

for ( i in 1:2 ) foo[i,2] <- my.fun( bar[,i,2] , another.arg )

that might otherwise pass unnoticed when 'bar' is a data.frame.

Subject: [Rd] par(mgp) bug (PR#916)
Message-ID: <200106190136.DAA15914@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi


> The behaviour of the third argument of par(mgp), which controls the
> placement of the axis ticks, is not working.
>
> In the following example, the plots should NOT be
> identical; the axis ticks plus the axis major line should be drawn one

This is more of an incompatibility-with-S rather than a bug.  In R,
axis(pos=) overrides axis(line=) which overrides par(mgp=).  It is possible
to get axis to respond to par(mgp=), but this is NOT the default behaviour.
For example,

par(mgp=c(3, 1, 1))
plot(1:10, axes=F)
box()
axis(1, line=NA)
axis(2)

In S, par(mgp=) specifies locations RELATIVE TO axis(line=), which can be
overridden by axis(pos=).

So the options are:
(i) become compatible NOW (for 1.3)
(ii) become compatible later
(iii) remain incompatible

I think we should do (i), especially because the default behaviour, which I
think would cover 99.999% of user code, would NOT change.

This is your chance to disagree ...

Subject: [Rd] Re: legend() with xpd=T; omission of initial plot character (PR#943)
Message-ID: <200106190356.FAA16102@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi

Bug summary:----
par(xpd=T)
plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.
Bug summary:----

I cannot reproduce this bug, BUT it did show up a bug in rect() -- in the
example above, the border around the legend is not drawn.

This is because rect() ignores par(xpd).  The default is rect(xpd=FALSE).  This
is at odds with text(xpd=NULL) and polygon(xpd=NULL) which use par(xpd) by
default.  arrows(xpd=FALSE) has the same problem as rect().  

I propose modifying rect() and arrows() to use par(xpd) by default like text()
and polygon().  There will, as usual, be a small risk that someone's code will
produce different output after this change, but this risk should be pretty
small.

Any objections ... ?

Paul

Coincidence, I *did* look at that bug only yesterday.
My experience:
   I *could* reproduce the bug {X11(), Linux-386}, but only a few times. 
   Then, it didn't show anymore. Even restarting R wouldn't show it again.
   My ``explanation'' was that it might be (a bug) inside X11 / Window manager
   handling of things... ??

It doesn't obey xpd either (PR#750).

I can now reproduce it -- I was looking in the wrong place: it's in

Our Solaris compilers run this without problem: I've been running that test
most days.

We have

markov% f77 -V
f77: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 FORTRAN 77 5.2 2000/09/11
Usage: f77 [ options ] files.  Use 'f77 -flags' for details
markov% cc -V
cc: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C 5.2 2000/09/11
usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details

and I am usually running agressive optimization options, e.g.

CC="cc -xarch=v9"
FC="f95 -xarch=v9"

CFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -g"
FFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -g"

asn that by default uses the BLAS in -lsunperf.

What is your setup?

I have the 5.0 Sun Workshop compilers, and I wasn't using any of those
optimisation flags, though Fortran is using -lsunmath.

I just did configure, make, with CC="cc -xarch=v9" and FC="f77 -xarch=v9"

I'll try again with the alignment flags specified.

Message-ID: <200106201841.UAA06762@pubhealth.ku.dk>


The crash is caused by a bus error: address alignment. Recompiling without
-lsunperf and with -dalign fixes it.

I think there is a configuration issue here (not for 1.3.0, though). The
documentation for the Sun BLAS says that -dalign is needed, but the
default configuration is to use the Sun BLAS and not -dalign.

Ok.  Note that this part of the configure code is taken from Octave,
which used to be reliable.  It would be great if we could pass info on
problems and solutions on to John Eaton as well (in particular as I
think that at some point of time there was talk about adding the code to
the autoconf contrib archive).

We had a related problem last week, resulting in dropping CXML/DXML
support due to problems on 64-bit platforms with gcc (if I recall
correctly).

Hmm ...

Subject: [Rd] .eps form of the R logo
Message-ID: <6rae32j1zt.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

Thomas Lumley and I are creating slides for short courses on R.  We
are using the prosper style for LaTeX (see prosper.sourceforge.net)
which allows the use of a logo on the slides.  It seems to be able to
handle .ps or .eps files.  The only versions of the R logo that I have
been able to find are .jpeg.  Although I can convert the .jpeg file to
.eps in an image manipulation program like GIMP I would prefer not
to duplicate the effort of others.  Has someone already done this?  If
so, where would I find the file?

I will add that to R-admin.texi, though.

I am not 100% sure this can be automated.  For a start, there are lots of
versions of the Sun compilers, and Thomas' is not current.  Really the
issue is that the compiler flags had better match, and that is very hard to
ensure except manually.  My f77 man page does say

          If you compile one subprogram or file with -dalign,
          then all subprograms and files in the program unit must
          be compiled with -dalign.

and my system is current (re-installed a month ago).

This issue comes up with mixed compilers too: AFAIR gcc does the equivalent
of -dalign and so could not be used with S-PLUS 3.2 (or about then, built
with SunPro cc).

Just gcc on Alpha running whatever Compaq calls Dec's UNIX today. CXML/DXML
are compiled with a different compiler.


So the general issue is the you need to ensure that you use the same
compiler and the same flags to compile R as you used for the libraries you
use, or know the perils if you do not.  I've just added a warning to
R-admin.texi about that.

In the Rnews sources, on your machine, file Rlogo.eps.

I do teach my students not to put logos on slides, though.  They (and
frames) only serve to distract the eye from the real information.

I'm not sure if the warning messages 

Warning messages: 
1: variable 67 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  
2: variable 70 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  
3: variable 71 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  

reported by model.frame.default (thru predict.rpart)
are correct in the following situation:

R> library(rpart)
R> querschnittMar01 <- read.table("querschnittMar01.csv", header=T, sep=";")
R> y <- querschnittMar01$diagnose
R> design <- querschnittMar01[, c("msd","ag","at","myas","an","ai","eag","eat",
          "eas","ean","eai","abrg","abrt","abrs","abrn","abri","hic","mhcg",
          "mhct","mhcs","mhcn","mhci","phcg","phct","phcs","phcn","phci",

          "rh","alfah","alfav","sex","patalter","flimmer","familie",
          "blutdruck","groesse","gewicht","bmi")]
R> tree <- rpart(y ~ ., data=design)
R> predict.rpart(tree, design)

where "sex", "blutdruck" and "familie" are factors. 

The warnings are given from the following lines in model.frame.default:

if(length(xlev) > 0) {
        for(nm in names(xlev))
            if(!is.null(xl <- xlev[[nm]])) {
                xi <- data[[nm]]
                if(is.null(nxl <- levels(xi)))
                    warning(paste("variable", nm, "is not a factor"))


where

Browse[1]> xlev
$"67"
[1] "M" "W"		<- variable "sex"

$"70"
[1] "Ja"   "Nein" 	<- variable "familie"

$"71"
[1] "Hypertonie" "Hypotonie"  "Normal"    <- variable "blutdruck"


Browse[1]> nm
[1] "67"

and 

Browse[1]> data[[nm]]
NULL

BUT

Browse[1]> data[,67]
  [1] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W
W W
 [38] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M

works as expected. The data is attached as querschnittMar01.csv.gz

Subject: [Rd] write.table(* , digits = ..) ?
Message-ID: <15159.4638.203418.415545@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Can anyone think of  reason why
  write.table() 
doesn't have an optional digits argument?
Via paste() and hence the internal "as.character" equivalent,
it obeys the options()$digits setting ...
which is quite logical for the experienced user, but not for others who
just want to `export' their data to a portable format.
I propose to add that argument in order to help these kind of users.

Well, it *is* covered in the `R Data Import/Export' manual under
write.table, and I assume all you intend to do is to include setting
options(digits=) and reset?

Why would you get 
  ../../../../share/make/../../../../etc/Makeconf
(all in one)?

The ctest Makefile has

top_builddir = ../../../..
R_HOME = $(top_builddir)
include $(top_builddir)/share/make/shlib.mk

and shlib.mk has

include $(R_HOME)/etc/Makeconf

???

Which version of make is this?

Yes, this had me confused as well...

>Which version of make is this?

Ahem...:
alnair:~/src/R-1.3.0> make -v
Make: Unknown flag argument v.  Stop.
Oh well, this is chaotic. All I know about this make is that
alnair:~/src/R-1.3.0> ls -l `which make`
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     system        15 Mar 25  1999 /bin/make -> ../ccs/bin/make

It seems I do have gmake version 3.79.1 as well, but it resulted in the
same error.

And I can't find g77....

Whoops, no sorry, it works with gmake 3.79.1! (I configured with
MAKE=/local/gnu/bin/make, but ran /bin/make). But I don't know yet if it
will pass make check.

On page 4, "more commonly know simply as XML" should probably be "more commonly

Thanks for marvelous documentation and a great product!

Subject: [Rd] Double inclusion of  "int R_OutputCon" from src/include/Rconnections.h (PR#996)
Message-ID: <200106262348.BAA28121@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I got a double defined symbol when linking src/modules/internet.dll
because 
internet.c and sockconn.c include Rconnections.h (... and do not even
need
R_OutputCon).

One should possibly remove such a global definitinon from the header
file.
As a temporary solution I declared the variable extern in Rconnections.h
and 
added in src/main/printutils.c the definition (only this file and
src/main/connections.c really use the variable).

Um, that's definitely not in the code in the system you quote below.

Yes, but the problem is AFAICS in what your linker does, as my C books say
it should merge all the occurrences.  All our platforms on which we are
able to test do so.  I did think about this and look it up.

Given that you use a very unusual system yet expect code to work on it
unchanged, it would be helpful to us if you compiled the pre-release
versions from time to time and sent in suggestions before release.
`R is a collaborative project ...'.

The packages feature of Rgui is great! However it looks the directory structure

the packages are now under /rw1030 (e.g., VR) and are not found by
install.packages(). Thus the error message:

Error in download.file(url, destfile, method, mode = "wb") :

Please don't jump the gun: remember that rw1030 is not yet on CRAN
and was not released when CRAN last ran a sweep.

That's a very temporary change to avoid people updating on rw1023 to
versions that needed rw1030, and it will change on CRAN tomorrow.


However, VR is already one of the recommended packages which come with
rw1030, so you don't need to install it from CRAN.

Um, no, the directory structure is the same. There's just no VR.zip
file in it.  VR is *inside* rw1030 so why would you want to download
it? 

If by any chance you are still using 1.2.3, packages that have become
obsolete(-escent) now sit in

Full_Name: Bill Kristan
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Linux Mandrake 8.0
Submission from: (NULL) (138.23.159.84)


I just downloaded the "unofficial" Mandrake 8.0 rpm from cran. So far the only
problem I've encountered is that my arrow keys no longer scroll through my
command history, but give ^[OA and ^[OB instead. Left and right arrow navigation
within a line is also broken. I checked previous reports, and when this was
reported in very early versions of R the suggested fix was to upgrade readline.
I upgraded to the newest available Mandrake rpm, which was readline-4.2-2, but
the behavior was the same. I was using the KDE terminal emulator, and tried
different keyboard layouts, but that didn't help either.

That would mean that the readline libs were not detected during the build phase.
I'd ask for a new build.

As a remedy, try running R within Emacs using the (outstanding) ESS mode.

The new na.exclude mechanism for linear models does not extend to
influence measures and diagnostics.

For the same reason, the plot method breaks for lm objects computed
with na.action=na.exclude.

x<-1:10
y<-c(rnorm(9),NA)
lm.influence(lm(y~x,na.action=na.exclude))

#Error in lm.influence(lm(y ~ x, na.action = na.exclude)) :

(This would have been our anniversary #1000 bug report, but some
spammer beat me to it - caught by Martin's filters, I assume)

Subject: [Rd] prototype for structured exception handling in R
Message-ID: <20010628102442.A7605@nokomis.stat.umn.edu>

One of the issues several of us have been discussing over the last few
months is how to incorporate a mechanism for structured exception
handling into R.  A prototype of one possible approach is available at

	http://www.stat.umn.edu/~luke/R/exceptions/simpcond.html

It is also available off the developer page,
http://developer.R-project.org.

The package that implements the prototype requires R 1.3.  (It is
mostly R code but needs a few hooks that have been added to R 1.3 to
allow experimenting with this sort of thing).

If you would find this sort of thing useful please give it a try and
let us know if you have any comments or suggestions.

Subject: [Rd] core dump running modreg-Ex.R (PR#1002)
Message-ID: <200106281714.TAA20621@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Version: R-1.3.0 
OS: Irix 6.5
Submission from: (NULL) (142.176.61.253)


R-1.3.0 was built on Irix 6.5 using gcc and MIPSPro f90.  This combination has
worked for previous versions, in particular R-1.2.3.

$ cd test/Examples
$ ../../bin/R --vanilla < modreg-Ex.R > modreg-Ex.Rout

This worked in R-1.2.3.  It looks like there were a number 
of cosmetic changes to the modreg Fortran sources since R-1.2.3. 
SGI MIPSPro f90 was used to compile modreg, e.g.:

   f90 -OPT:IEEE_NaN_inf=ON -KPIC -O2 -c sslvrg.f -o sslvrg.o

Regenerating modreg.so using g77 (e.g., $ gmake FC=g77 ALL_FFLAGS='-O2 -g')

We had a private report of this on Iris 6.5, and the resolution was that it
worked with optimization off.

This is the only platform reporting a problem, so we need someone to debug
it there.

This is related to bug #865, which I have discovered is a problem with some
of the very basic transformation code in R graphics (for transforming widths
or heights when there are log scales).  I have a fix for this particular
mtext() problem, but I'm still working on the more general transformation
bug.

Subject: [Rd] interaction() -- problem with drop (PR#1003)
Message-ID: <200106290030.CAA22337@pubhealth.ku.dk>


(R-1.3.0 on linux, alpha and intel; also tested on R-1.1.1 on irix.)

Below is a program that creates some random data (n, x, and y), creates a
factor out of x and y and then creates a factor z out of their interaction
(corresponding, with the default nf = 2, to quadrants, which is how I came
upon this).  It then runs an analysis of variance.

f.test.problem <- 
function(n = 100, nf = 2){

  t1 <- data.frame(n = rnorm(n), x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))

  t1$x <- cut(t1$x, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$y <- cut(t1$y, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = F)
  
  print(table(t1$x))
  print(table(t1$y))
  print(table(t1$z))
  
  summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
}

Here's the problem:  if none of the nf * nf levels of z is empty -- that
is, if there is at least one trial taking on each value -- I get the error
"Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type".

traceback() gives:

8: model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts)
7: model.matrix(mt, mf, contrasts)
6: lm(formula = n ~ z, data = t1, singular.ok = TRUE)
5: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
4: eval(lmcall, parent.frame())
3: aov(n ~ z, data = t1)
2: summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
1: f.test.problem(nf = 3)


However, if one of the levels of z is empty (which I'm checking using
table), then the analysis of variance runs!  (Easy to see if you use nf =
4 or even 3; it won't take long to get some examples that run and some
that don't.)

Creating n and z outside of a dataframe and then running aov(n~z) doesn't
help.

The problem does not arise if I do aov(n ~ x, data = t1) or 
aov(n ~ y, data = t1) -- the analysis of variance runs whether there are
empty categories or not.


Finally:  if I specify drop = T in the interaction call:
t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = T)
then the analysis works whether a factor actually gets dropped or
not.  That is, even when no factor is empty (and so I got an error with
drop = F), everything works.

So the problem seems to arise from something going on in interaction.  I'm
not sure what, and I'm sure someone else will see the problem faster than
I will.

Apologies in advance if I'm being dense and this is really how things
ought to work.  If not, I'll submit a formal bug report.

Message-ID: <200106290549.HAA22957@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Based on a report to the Windows maintainers from Richard Rowe
<Richard.Rowe@jcu.edu.au>:

NEWS for 1.3.0 says

    o   Exact p-values are available for the two-sided two-sample
        Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

I think the (new) p-values are computed but are backwards:

> x <- rnorm(50)
> y <- runif(50)
> ks.test(x,y, exact=T)$p
[1] 1
> 1 - ks.test(x,y, exact=T)$p

[1] 0.02015456

[1] 0.9971923

I'll commit the obvious fix unless anyone knows better.  Neither value
agrees well with S-PLUS 6, which gives

Thanks for doing.  I had received a similar private bug report but had
not gotten to fixing this.

Strange because the underlying algorithm should be the same.  Have you
tried R vs Splus on larger samples (say, 100 each)?

The facility was not put in for Computer Modern, but for other more
normally encoded fonts (specifically Monotone Times and Lucida).  The
postscript help page does say

     It is the user's responsibility to check that suitable fonts are
     made available, and that they contain the needed characters when
     re-encoded.

and latter

     ###  ---- Use TeX's Computer Modern fonts ---
     ## Only use alphanumeric chars here.

R has the encoding hard-coded in plotmath.c, which is *much* more
serious, and is why Symbol is hardcoded.

I don't follows this. Only a single driver users afm files, and it has
several versions (ps, pdf, xfig).  How would the below be relevant to the
Windows drivers, say.

`Patches will be accepted' I think sums this up.  No other program I know
allows the flexibility that is already in R, and that took a lot of hard
work, which I am not sure you have appreciated.

You've forgotten -fPIC.  That should be found automatically: it is on
my Solaris 2.7 system using gcc-3.0.

Set CPICFLAGS (and probably FPICFLAGS and CXXPICFLAGS) in config.site,
make clean, reconfigure, rebuild.

Subject: [Rd] Rd tag \link not working without \code (PR#1006)
Message-ID: <200106300209.EAA02646@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Even though I know the Rd format might be replaced soon, I am report this just
in case:

The package optional argument for \link is *only* used when \link is in a \code
environment. Example:

  1) This link works: \code{\link[base]{cat}}
  2) But not this one: \link[base]{cat}

It looks like the "base" argument in the second case is not used at all. In HTML
this results in a "missing" link, i.e. the search page is called. It is 
interesting to use \link without \code for non-object help pages such as
"Introduction" etc.

It's a typo: line 564 of share/perl/R/Rdconv.pm should be

	my ($id, $arg, $opt) = get_link($text);

That really would not have been hard to investigate!

Yes, the documentation was clear on this. I was just hopeful that it would
work well enough to do all basic plot labels with TeX's fonts.

This might be a reason to alter the font encodings in the ps file to match
R, rather than try to change R. I'll have to look at whether it really
makes sense to do that in postscript, though.

I don't really know how fonts work in windows. Clearly this would only be
an improvement for output using the ps fonts.

I'm sorry that I gave the impression that I don't appreciate the work that
has gone into R. I really think it is a great program. It is just so close
to solving all the data analysis and plotting problems that I have had
that I am hopeful that a few small modifications could bring it the rest
of the way. I will look further at what changes would need to be made, but
I am a newbie to R, so I have a lot to learn.

With me quickly getting there this morning ...

I had asked about multiple version (and also platform) support several
times during the past few years, and had always been told that this was
not necessary.  So why does this keep coming up?

One can add a version layer, but one has to do this right.  Patterning
after the Emacs model is wrong.  Binary incompatabilities were pointed
out, so

	PREFIX/lib/R/VERSION
	PREFIX/lib/R/site

is not good enough.  Emacs has added [the equivalent of]

	PREFIX/lib/R/site/VERSION

but that requires external control of version dependency at install
time.  We actually have the required info through the DESCRIPTION db,
hence could take care of this.

But the effort is really only worth it when one is interested in having
different versions installed at the same time.  Otherwise, you can
always do

	make install
	(cd PREFIX/lib; mv R R-VERSION)

yourself.

Developers, as PD says, typically rely on running their development
version from BUILDDIR.  Otoh, this is wrong because they could end up
with an incompatible add-on package in the site tree.  And we are back
to the long-made decision that God did not want us to run multiple R
versions at the same time.

The code you suggested adding is level-2 PostScript and does not work on
my office printer, for example.  So, yes, it would break things.  This is
why such code is the preserve of a Document Manager in the print spooling
system in Adobe's model.

R follows the recommendations of the PostScript Language Reference Manual
(Appendix G, to be precise).  Looks like StarOffice and GIMP *on your Linux
installation* do not.

Instinctively, I don't think we want to go there... Wouldn't one end
up with (the equivalent of)

Um, I did that once and the walls came tumblin' down... (Or rather, I
tried to move the existing install out of the way before installing a
new one.) You also need to fixup the R_HOME_DIR variable in the R
script as Beebe mentioned.

Er, how?

IF we drop the "easy package migration" aspect and just let people do
separate installs with separate generation of site libraries, would we
not be in the clear? There's also an issue with private libraries of
course. Versioning those would put some administrative burden on the
end user, but could we not adapt an "if it breaks, you get to keep
both pieces" policy?

In all other cases the $v component is a matrix. Also, the $u component

It's the famous `programmer bug' of not using  `` , drop = FALSE ''
when matrix subscripting in functions....

in the 2nd-to-last line of svd() :

    if(nv && nv < p) z$v <- z$v[, 1:nv, drop = FALSE]

I think "easy package migration"  is a great objective, but I expect it is a serious
constraint sometimes. In some respects, as a user, reliable is more important. It is
easier to expect that you always have to re-build packages then to expect you don't
need to and then get surprised sometimes.  There are whole operating systems
dedicated to showing that "easy" can be very difficult when it doesn't work.

Please keep in mind that the problems don't always come just with different R
versions. I'm currently using two systems (Solaris 5.6 and 5.8)  with a shared nfs
file system and I find that R built on 5.8 does not work on 5.6.

(Also, please keep in mind that R is not always installed by someone with root
priveleges.)

Subject: [Rd] formulas in variables in modeling functions
Message-ID: <OFC33AA95D.63C7CD15-ON85256A5E.004E396D@rtp.epa.gov>

I first noticed this in gnls, but it also happens in lm, so I suspect the
following phenomenon is universal in modeling functions.  Modify the
example from the lm help:

model <- as.formula(weight ~ group)
lm(model)

The result will be printed:

> lm(model)

Call:
lm(formula = model)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Coefficients:
(Intercept)     groupTrt
      5.032       -0.371

This is because in lm, (where the return value is z) z$call is set to cl,
and cl <- match.call().

My question is:  would it break things to add the line

cl[["formula"]] <- formula
after
cl <- match.call()
?

The result of this is:

> lm.new(model)

Call:
lm.new(formula = weight ~ group)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Coefficients:
(Intercept)     groupTrt
      5.032       -0.371

It would.  Think about how update() works.

What's wrong with

lm(weight ~ group)

or if you need it

eval(substitute(lm(model), model=model))

?  There is a difference between capturing the formula or using a
reference to a formula.

Are you sure we have the right info? We know if a package is
source-incompatible with old versions of R but we may not know if it is
binary-incompatible with new versions.  I was surprised to find that
survival seems to be binary-incompatible between 1.2.3 and 1.3.0 -- at
least, several bugs went away when I recompiled with pre1.3.0

Message-ID: <200106011547.RAA03073@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Paul Mather
Version: 1.2.3
OS: Digital Unix 4.0D
Submission from: (NULL) (128.173.35.237)


The precompiled binary for "osf4.0" distributed via CRAN does not run under
Digital Unix 4.0.  The error given is:

Fatal error: The X11 shared library could not be loaded.
  The error was dlopen: cannot load /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R_X11.so

Subsequent investigation actually reveals that the R_X11.so was linked against
libdnet.so, which is not present on standard Digital Unix 4.0D systems.  The
error is triggered by an inability to load the libdnet.so shared library.

As I understand it, libdnet provides DECnet support.  Digital Unix 4.0D systems
ship with libdnet_stub.so, which is a library of empty stub functions.

Is it possible to provide a version of R_X11.so linked against libdnet_stub.so?
Aside from this problem, the precompiled binary appears to work (i.e.,
"R -g none" runs).

Cheers,

Paul.

Subject: [Rd] Unified naming for R<system>_tmpnam possible?
Message-ID: <3b17e6bf.thoffman.zappa@zappa.sax.de>

What is the reason that the system specific files (sys-unix.c et.al.) all define a specific
name for building tmpfile?

In main/devPS.c then there is an #ifdef sequence which calls depending on the
system defined the respective function.

Wouldn't it be better just to have one function R_tmpnam(), which is implemented
system dependent in the sys-<system>.c files?

Subject: [Rd] What is the logic behind sys-common, sys-unix et.al. ?
Message-ID: <3b17f4a4.thoffman.zappa@zappa.sax.de>

I try to understand how the system specifics are organised in R.

My understanding was that (citing system.txt):

 *	sys-common.c  has code common to the unix/gnome/gnuwin32 ports
 *	sys-unix.c    has code common to the unix/gnome ports
 *	system.c      has interface-specific code

But now I see that unix/sys-common contains unix and Win32 specific code which is selected via
#ifdefs. 

Another question is who carries the sys-common file? If it is "common", why does a specific
system subdir (unix, that is) carry this file? 

I know that there are historical reasons for that, but is there a "plan" for reorganising this stuff, now 
that there is at least a third class of systems (macintosh) involved?

Another question is: Should the graphics interfaces be connected to the systems in a 1:1 fashion?
I have a test build of R-1.2.3 for OS/2 an my hard disk which is able to use a Presentation Manager
and a X11 graphics device: X11 is a 1:1 copy of the unix/X11 files. (And I assume "that new Macs" I
do not know anything about can display X11, too. And for Win32 exist X11 servers ...)

Yes, now there is a Macintosh maintainer that had occurred to some of us.

However, as this is not part of the R API, I don't see this is of any
interest except to R-core, and changing things that work is not a high
priority.

We do not support X11 on Windows, even though it can be built.

No need to give up so quickly!

First, there could be an option for postscript level in the PS driver.  Adobe
acrobat reader, staroffice, etc. have an option like this, where you can
select level 1, 2, 3.  People who have a level 1 printer, could just select
level 1 output.

Secondly, you can use a "protected" setpagedevice call that will work on both
level 1 and level 2 printers.  It looks something like this:

/setpagedevice where { pop << /param value ...  >> setpagedevice } if

The 'where' command will return false if setpagedevice isn't defined, and thus
it setpagedevice will never get called.

It's not just those programs.  Lots of applications will output setpagedevice
commands to control paper size, duplex, etc.  It's usually the ones with more
comprehensive postscript support, that have these features.

I've never seen such a program on Solaris, which comes with a conformant
Document Manager as part of its spool system.

That other programs choose to take over the role of Document Manager is
no reason for R to do so.    These cludges are common in the Windows world,
and it is probably no coincidence that the programs you mention are
all versions of of copies of Windows programs.

Have you checked Sun's star office under solaris?  I just checked framemaker
under solaris, and it does output paper size commands.  But I gather that this
doesn't really matter to you.

Thankfully R is open source, so I will just add it myself.  You're solaris has
a document manager, so screw you attitude isn't very helpfull.  Just one more
patch I will have to apply to new versions.

Dear package author,

We are still accepting submissions for the second issue of the R
Newsletter.  For more information see

      http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/

If you are the author of a package on CRAN and you would like to promote
it a little bit, or if you simply have an interesting application using
R, we hope you can find some time to write a short article on it.  We
suggest that it be approximately 2 pages or less.  The idea of the
newsletter is that it be interesting to R users without being too
technical.  For example an article describing a package could begin by
briefly outlining the statistical background and go on to demonstrate
the usage on some typical data set.  Of course graphics are more than
welcome!

Bill Venables is also encouraging submissions to the more specialist
Programmer's Niche column.  In this case the technical level could be a
little higher, of course, but not necessarily: ingeniousness is the key.

Instructions for authors can be found in ``Writing Articles for R News''
in the first issue of Rnews; more detailed instructions will shortly be
available on the web page.  Remember that submissions have to be in
LaTeX, and that graphics are preferred in PDF or EPS format.  (Bitmaps
like JPG are also OK but please keep in mind that those cannot be scaled
easily and hence might look ugly in the final version.)

The deadline for submissions is

	 June 13, 2001

Keep the contributions rolling in!

For the Editorial Board,

Subject: [Rd] update.packages() and parse(text="A B") (PR#966)
Message-ID: <200106031334.PAA07820@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi!

I just used the following command on our NT-Server:

  update.packages()
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : parse error

The problem is caused by the package gregmisc:

  x <- CRAN.packages()
  x[which(x == "gregmisc"),]

   Package    Version   Priority     Bundle    Depends 
"gregmisc"    "0.1.3"       "NA"       "NA"       "R " 


The error occurs in the line

  z[k] <- eval(parse(text = comptext))

in package.dependencies(), because in this case is:

  comptext
[1] "\"1.2.3\"  \"R \""


Best regards,
Uwe Ligges

This is a known problem with gregmisc already reported to maintainer and
fixed on my server (so it will propagate to CRAN shortly).  An update
to gregmisc is promised shortly.

Something similar happens on Unix (which is where I spotted it).  I
think you need to REMOVE gregmisc to fix it.

Yes.  What a nightmare.

[We potentially have control over this, though, through the Depends info
in the package DESCRIPTION dbs.  E.g., update.packages() could try to
organize packages with R version dependencies into version-dependent
subdirs.  But again: suppose pkg A depends on R version B and package B
which may be available but need another version of R.  So we may need
the version of package B for the same version of R etc etc ...]

I think we are much better off with the current `always take the most
current one' approach.

Of course.  But then how do you invoke R?  You either follow Emacs and
have

	R-1.2.3
	R-1.3.0

in your PATH somewhere, or you have a command line option for setting
the version.  And then we're back to the above, worrying about (mostly
binary but not necessarily so; what if there is a change in the
documentation system?) version dependencies in your site tree.

See above.  You're saying `tell everyone that they can do FOO to get
multiple version trees but then they're on their own'.  And then we get
all kinds of bug reports ...

Well ... at greatest generality one could support multiple versions of R
for multiple platforms in the same tree.  E.g., via

	R_HOME/VERSION/share
	R_HOME/VERSION/bin/PLATFORM
	R_HOME/VERSION/library/PKG/R
	R_HOME/VERSION/library/PKG/libs/PLATFORM

etc etc.  Again, long time ago it was decided not to have this.  

> (Also, please keep in mind that R is not always installed by someone

Right.  But the above could be applied to all library trees, at least.

Interesting.  I thought this would not be the case.  What you say is
that a package may claim it only needs R 1.2.2 but this might not run
under R 1.3.0 if compiled under R 1.2.2?

But version incompatibilities go beyond binary incompatibilties.  So
even if we have the info I am not sure what to do.

Hmm... nlme stopped working for me somewhere in the 1.2.2-patched
series. I'm not altogether sure why, but I might have recompiled R to
use ATLAS somewhere along the road. Not that there's any reason to try
and figure out exactly what happened, but it reminded me that things
like compiler and library setup might also be changed between
versions.

Good point.  A reconfigured system might very well break things ...

Message-ID: <200106041729.TAA11328@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Gregory R. Warnes
Version: R 1.2.3
OS: Linux (debian test)
Submission from: (NULL) (192.77.198.200)



The documentation for boxplot.stats() states that the 
element "n" of the return list is "the number of of 
non-`NA' observations in the sample.".  However, 
boxplot.stats() currently returns the total number 
of observations instead. 

Example:

> boxplot.stats( c(1:10,rep(NA,10) ) )

$stats
[1]  1.0  3.0  5.5  8.0 10.0

$n
[1] 20

$conf
[1] 3.733506 7.266494

$out
numeric(0)

The problem is the statement 

  n <- length(nna) # including +/- Inf

in boxplot.stats().  It should be

  n <- sum(nna) # including +/- Inf

Correcting this line yields:

> boxplot.stats( c(1:10,rep(NA,10) ) )
$stats
[1]  1.0  3.0  5.5  8.0 10.0

$n
[1] 10

$conf
[1] 3.001801 7.998199

$out
numeric(0)

Dear R,

I would like to report what I think is a bug in R.  I am running R
within emacs on a Digital AlphaStation.  See the version information
at the end of my R session for details.  I also attach a copy of the
file that is read in the `read.table' command.

Here's my R session, with a few comments added in to show what I
think is wrong:

You could very well be tickling a memory bug, but that version of R is
more than a year out of date and things have changed considerably in
the meantime. Could you please retry with a more recent version? 

And, BTW, large attachments are quite difficult to extract once they
have been mangled by the mailing list and bug filing software, so only
use them as a last resort. It's much preferable if you put it up
separately on your homepage or FTP site.

Subject: [Rd] error in make install-info (PR#969)
Message-ID: <200106051743.TAA16230@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi 
I'm installing R with the standard commands:

        ./configure
        make
	make check 
        make dvi        to create DVI versions
        make pdf        to create PDF versions
        make info       to create info files
 
        make install
        make install-dvi
        make install-info
        make install-pdf
     
Everything works fine apart from "make install-info":

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@fyb012000002 /home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev]# make install-info
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev/doc/manual'
Usage: mkinstalldirs [-h] [--help] [-m mode] dir ...
make[1]: *** [/usr/local/lib/Rdevel/info/dir] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/DOWNLOADS/R/Rdev/doc/manual'
make: [install-info] Error 2 (ignored)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens from R-1.2.3 (and previous) as well as for R-devel (1.3.0).
Anything to worry about (it seens harmless)?

Thanks 
P.J.

In the devel snapshot from this morning a previously saved workspace (.RData) does
not get loaded. (If that is a new feature I missed it in the NEWS file.)

It's likely caused by

/doc/manual/Makefile:  @$(MKINSTALLDIRS) -p $(infodir)

in which I suspect that one can safely lose the "-p" since
mkinstalldirs obviously doesn't know what to do with it...

BTW we seem to be alternately using $(MKINSTALLDIRS) and
$(top_srcdir)/tools/mkinstalldirs for this purpose. Anyone have a clue
on whether this ought to be standardized?

Indeed! 
I've removed the "-p" and it worked well.

Thanks for spotting this.  The `-p' is wrong.  Removed now.

Yes, of course.  We use the latter in the add-on package Makefiles.
These do not include $(top_builddir)/Makeconf where MKINSTALLDIRS is
defined.  I think we can safely stay with the current solution.

Best,

Hm. Doesn't happen with 1.2.3 on Linux and dbeta.c hasn't changed
inbetween. Any chance of getting you to step through the computations
with a debugger on you machine?

It does happen on Solaris 2.7, though, which might give Peter a means
to look at it on an earlier Solaris.

Indeedy. Looks like we're passing a-1 and a+b-2 on to dbinom_raw as x
and n respectively and this comes out with x > n due to roundoff so we
get zero returned.

Argh, how does one fix that?

(It's usually the intel FPUs that pull that kind of stunt on us...)

Message-ID: <200106070515.HAA24878@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

and is getting technical.  Maybe CRAN/Devel packages are best discussed on
R-devel anyway.

That X server has DPS and type 1 scaleable fonts including for Helvetica.
The X11 device chooses fonts by

devX11.c:static char *fontname_R6 =
"-adobe-helvetica-%s-%s-*-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*

and if the X server does not have Adobe Helvetica in the specified size
etc one would need to look at exactly what it does give you.  My
Solaris one will have Adobe Helvetica in the right encoding.

whereas in R, the 3rd name is "x", the same as the 1st one.
I think R should behave the same as S+5.1..

Actually, that's an S/S incompatibility:

S-PLUS : Copyright (c) 1988, 1996 MathSoft, Inc.
S : Copyright AT&T.
Version 3.4 Release 1 for Sun SPARC, SunOS 5.3 : 1996 
Working data will be in .Data 
cbind(data.frame(x=1,y=2), data.frame(x=4,u=3))
  x y x u 
1 1 2 4 3

(We might of course still want to follow the more recent S-PLUS,
although perhaps not put too draconian measures in to keep names
unique.)

Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.33.0106071439180.48906-100000@homer17.u.washington.edu>


The AIX build of the development version isn't quite working due to a
problem in the automatic symbol extraction process.

Compilation of R itself goes fine, but then in the script tools/ldAIX4
doesn't extract the symbols from arithmetic.o.  This is because
  bash-2.01$ nm arithmetic.o
  nm: arithmetic.o: 0654-206 Cannot process the symbol table.

As a result, R_finite is not exported and the vfonts module cannot be
built.  If the necessary symbols are added by hand to etc/R.exp then the
rest of the build proceeds normally.

Compiling arithmetic.c doesn't produce any errors (gcc) and the symbol
table problem doesn't seem to happen for any other object file.

Any ideas?

Not really.  Which nm is that, the native one or from GNU binutils?

Subject: [Rd] Generalising object.size
Message-ID: <3B208DC1.4947887E@durham.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Currently (R-1.2.3) object.size called with an environment tells you the
size of the environment handle but not the size of the sum of the
objects contained within the environment.  Is anyone but me interested
in the following simple generalisation:

"object.size" <- function (x, expand.envir = FALSE)
{
  if (expand.envir && is.environment(x)) {
    s <- 0
    for (i in ls(envir=x))
      s <- s + Recall(get(i, envir=x))
    s
  } else
    .Internal(object.size(x))
}

> fred <- new.env()
> assign("letters", letters, envir=fred)
> assign("numbers", 1:10, envir=fred) 
> object.size(fred)
[1] 28
> object.size(fred, TRUE)
[1] 408

As an aside, I had to use a for-loop here because Recall does not work
inside a sapply:

	sum(sapply(ls(envir=x), function(i) Recall(get(i, envir=x))))

causes an infinite recursion because the wrong function gets
"Recall"-ed.  Is there any way around this?

Cheers, Jonathan.

yes, indeed!

And, btw, the bug is gone in R version 1.2.3 (and R-devel):

Subject: [Rd] update.packages fails again (PR#972)
Message-ID: <200106082025.WAA20114@pubhealth.ku.dk>

It's happened again:

exactRankTests_0.4-2.tar.gz has

Depends: R > 1.3.0

which is not only impossible, but breaks update.packages.

How can we test for this?

Unfortunately once such a package is installed, it has to be manually
uninstalled before update.packages will work again.

*PLEASE* can people read the manual to get the syntax right: it is

Depends: R (>= 1.3.0)

but such packages should not be in the main part of CRAN yet.

yes.  What changed from r-release to r-devel is how the endianness
flags, hw and lw, are handled.  Get rid of the const or the static
keyword, and arithmetic.c compiles and nm can read the symbol table.
Looks like a compiler/assembler bug to me...

Suggestion until 'static const int' works in AIX: Change around line 87:

#ifndef _AIX
#  ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
static const int hw = 0;
static const int  lw = 1;
#  else  /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
static const int hw = 1;
static const int lw = 0;
#  endif /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#else
        /* 'static const int' doesn't work on AIX */
#  ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
static int hw = 0;
static int  lw = 1;
#  else  /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
static int hw = 1;
static int lw = 0;
#  endif /* WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#endif

Above compiles, links, etc. for me with r-devel from today.


> Not really.  Which nm is that, the native one or from GNU binutils?

I had the problems with the native one.  I don't have the GNU binutils
installed.

I'll check this after my build with the native cc/f77 finishes (it takes
about four hours).  It doesn't look as though the native compilers have
this problem -- it's got as far as the help pages, which are the slowest
part.

type if "p" points are plotted, if "l", the points are 
  joined by lines, if "b" there are points and lines,
  if "s" there are points and a smooth fitted curve,
  if "S" there is a curve.

Example:

library(mass)
data(cabbages)
xyplot(HeadWt~VitC|Date, panel=panel.superpose,
   groups=Cult, data=cabbages, type="s",span=2)
xyplot(HeadWt~VitC|Date, panel=panel.superpose,
   groups=Cult, data=cabbages, type="s",span=2)

Here is the altered code.  The changes are in the statements
          if (type == "p" || type == "b"||type=="s"){ ....}
and the new code:
                if ((type=="s"||type=="S")&&is.finite(x[id])&&
		         is.finite(y[id])){
                    span <- list(...)$span
                    if(is.null(span))span <- 2/3
                    iter <- list(...)$iter
                    if(is.null(iter))iter <- 3
                    xy <-   lowess(x[id], y[id], f = span, iter = iter)

                }


panel.superpose <-

    pch = superpose.symbol$pch, cex = superpose.symbol$cex,

            y <- as.numeric(y)
        if (is.shingle(x) || is.shingle(y)) 
            stop("sorry, panel.superpose does not allow shingles")

Damn it.  I thought that my Perl code in R CMD check

    if($description->{"Depends"} =~ /\bR *\([^)]*\)/) {
        ## The `Depends' field is not required, and currently only R
        ## version dependencies are used, which must be of the form
        ## `R ($op $version)' with `$op' one of `<=' or `>='.
        $log->checking("DESCRIPTION Depends field");
        $description->{"Depends"} =~ /\bR *\(([^) ]+) *([^) ]+)\)/;
        if((($1 eq "<=") || ($1 eq ">=")) && $2) {
            $log->result("OK");
        }
        else {
            $log->warning();
            $log->message("  malformed Depends field");
        }
    }

was good enough.  It is intended to check for just that: even more
precisely for exactly what is used by R lateron.

For the offending package I get no warning.  Argh.

How can this be installed?  I though if you ran R CMD INSTALL then it
would figure this out.  At least, this is what

  depends=`get_dcf_field Depends DESCRIPTION`
  depends=`echo ${depends} | grep 'R *('`
  if test "${depends}"; then
    depends=`echo ${depends} | sed 's/.*R *(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/;s/=/= /'`
    dep_operator=`set - ${depends}; echo ${1}`
    dep_version=`set - ${depends}; echo ${2}`
    ## Currently, only operators `<=' and `>=' are supported.  Hence we
    ## check this, and also whether we found a version string.
    if (test "${dep_operator}" = "<=" \
        || test "${dep_operator}" = ">=") \
        && test -n "${dep_version}"; then
      dep_ok=`expr ${R_VERSION} ${dep_operator} ${dep_version} `
      if test ${dep_ok} -eq 0; then
        echo "ERROR: This R is version ${R_VERSION}"
        echo "       package \`${pkg}' depends on R ${dep_version}"
        exit 1;
      fi
    else
      echo "WARNING: malformed \`Depends' field in \`DESCRIPTION'"
    fi
  fi

in INSTALL is supposed to do.  Same problem, most likely.

Will have a look later.

I'm sorry! exactRankTests_0.4-4.tar.gz is now in incoming and

Subject: [Rd] documentation and \sloppy (PR#976)
Message-ID: <200106102050.WAA26838@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi
When preparing documentation using Rd2dvi sometimes we get "overflow" on
some lines. The consequence is that in the documentation there are some
lines where words are not hyphenated or moved. The final document has some
lines with more columns than the rest of the text. 
This happens when we use \code{} (which probably calls the \tt in latex).

I've been checking the documentation (.pdf files) of a few packages  and
this seens to occours all over.

One possible way to correct this is  by introducing the command
\sloppy
on the header of the automatically generated .tex files. It seens to work
fine in some tests I've run.

I'm wondering whether the "\sloppy" can be incorporated to the Rd2dvi
command. 

Cheers
P.J.

Subject: [Rd] Additional output in cancor
Message-ID: <3B247F91.CAD6F5E4@durham.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Can I suggest an additional output component in cancor, from package
mva?  It would be useful to have the number of canonical correlation
vectors, equivalently the rank of the covariance between x and y (label
"rank").  This would usually be min(dx, dy), where dx and dy have
already been computed for the svd function, but there might be
situations where it was less than this, so I guess the safe option would
be to include

	rank = qr(t(x) %*% y)$rank

among the outputs.  Then the last four lines of the help might be

     rk <- cxy$rank
     all.equal(cor(x %*% cxy$xcoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE],
       y %*% cxy$ycoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(cxy$cor))
     all.equal(cor(x %*% cxy$xcoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(1, rk))
     all.equal(cor(y %*% cxy$ycoef[, 1:rk, drop=FALSE]), diag(1, rk))

which I think is more intuitive.

More radically, the xcoef and ycoef components of cancor might
themselves be restricted to the appropriate columns (1:rank).  This
might affect some existing code, although any code that uses the
non-informative columns has got to be broken, hasn't it?!

Can I also suggest an extra reference for the help page:

Oh, great timing!   R went into feature-freeze last night for 1.3.0.
No new features until 1.4.0 in December or whatever comes next.

Nope.  It's rare, but needing to span the orthocomplement can happen.

I'd say that was inferior to Seber (and I find it rather confusing).

Small new features have been known to slip into the patch releases
though, but if there's *any* chance of getting something wrong, we
should not include it during feature freeze, however little it might
seem. Changing arguments and result components must be off-limits by
principle, if only because the effort invested in ensuring that they
are harmless would be better spent on fixing known bugs.

Yes it can, using the Rd.cfg mechanism.  If there is a file Rd.cfg in your
TEXINPUTS path, it gets read at the bottom of Rd.sty.  This should allow
you to change the TeX penalties (which is what \sloppy does AFAIR).

I think Rd2dvi is intended only to be a simple mechanism to produce
a reasonable printed manual, but the Rd.cfg mechanism allows some
customization.  My view is that a few overlaps into the right margin is
less distracting that the `loose' typesetting that \sloppy encourages.

To my inverted way of thinking there is something wrong with the general
logic of what is being attempted here.

I think people should be encouraged to upgrade to the most recent
released version of R. At best I test my packages with the last two
releases of R, so it is only by accident that the "Depends" line on my
packages may not specify the most recent release.

On the other hand, an unmaintained package could quickly depend on an
older version of R. I don't see any way a package maintainer can specify
this, but there could be some mechanism (possible tied to passing R CMD
check) that specifies dependency on an older version of R. Perhaps this
might also be formally recognized as a mechanism for moving things out
of the contrib section of CRAN.  If this is to be written into a file in
the package it would require modifying the contents of the tar ball, but
if it could be coded into a prefix on the package name it might be
simpler?

You can do

	Depends: R (<= 1.2.3)

The logic is to allow packages to depend on unreleased versions, or
known new features (only in x.y.0 releases, of course ...).

It's useful for the >=1.3.0 versions around at present, and of course
as an encouragement to upgrade.

Yes, but the problem is that building a package now, say for 1.3.0,
who  knows whether one should specify

Depends: R (< 2.0)
or
Depends: R (< 3.0)

And when those versions come along the maintainer may not be around to
make the change to the Depends line. (An if they were they would
probably update the package instead.)

Yes, a < depends should almost never be correct. However, changing it to a
prefix doesn't help with this.  About the only situation when this would
apply is if we decide to break source compatibility  (eg to put threads
in). Here the CRAN maintainers will know what the dependency is, but it
may not be fixed immediately.

We don't want the depends to mean "was only tested with". It should mean
"will not work without". In most cases only the package maintainer can
distinguish between a bug (which may be exposed more clearly by a new
version of R)  and a valid dependency.

Actually, a `<' never is.  Only `<=' and `>=' are allowed, according to
the docs.

We have an informal mechanism of moving old versions into version
specific ``old'' subdirs.  Here's what happens.  When a new release
comes along I test all packages (argh) against the new version.  The
ones that do not pass R CMD check for the new version will be moved out
to the `old' subdirs, unless a new version comes along (in which case
they are stored somewhere else).

At least, this was the old way.  Now that we actually have an archive of
old packages, we maybe should put them in there as well and record the
last version they were known to work with somewhere else.  (Or change
the DESCRIPTION Depends info accordingly?)

Argh.

Subject: [Rd] R-devel on alpha Tru64: cxml/dxml problem (PR#977)
Message-ID: <200106111812.UAA09885@pubhealth.ku.dk>



Hi,

I just run a ./configure --enable-R-shlib; make; make check; with a recent
(11.6.2001) R-devel snapshot on Tru64 4.0F (with libcxml):

make check stops in base-Ex.R at:

> ###--- >>> `plot.window' <<<----- Set up World Coordinates for Graphics
Window>
>       ## alias         help(plot.window)
>

> loc <- cmdscale(eurodist)
Error in La.eigen(Tmat, symmetric = TRUE) :
        On entry to DSYEV  parameter number 8 had an illegal value
Execution halted

The problem is, that by default the accelerated blas library (libdxml or
libcxml) is found by ./configure and gets used (DSYEV resides in this
library) 

I stopped using libdxml/libcxml with R long ago because I had similar
problems (using libdxml on Tru64 4.0E) with some of my libraries, but I
thought it was my fault. The interesting thing is, that some of the dxml
functions are useable, some not.

Now I took a closer look and recognized that libdxml/libcxml are linked
with the DEC/Compaq Fortran runtime libraries:

I guess because we are using gcc/g77 and not DEC cc/f77 we cannot use
CXML/DXML libraries.

And indeed, make check succeeds with "--without-blas" added to the
configure options.

Solution:

I would suggest to modify the configure script not to use dxml/cxml on
alpha-tru64 by default.

I guess this is where I was confused. I was thinking that depends should
indicate to a user that the version of a package and version(s) of R
have been tested together. "Have been tested together" seems like useful
information for a user, but I guess the real philosophy on that is that
a user should get the latest release R and the latest version of a
package from CRAN and these have been tested together (I think).

I think you should promote the "upgrade to the latest version" approach
and not put too much effort into which old versions of packages work
with old versions of R. The depends information which is in a package
will already give people a pretty good clue if they are really desperate
for a package that is no longer being maintained.  My concern was mainly
because I did not at first realize that you already had a mechanism for
moving packages to "old."

R developers: anyone against that?

If not: Albrecht, can you suggest code which fixes the problem?  Should
we turn off checking for dxml/cxml in general?  I'd rather not special
case a specific platform (or even in combo with a specific compiler).

I think we should just remove the checks.  They are run on all platforms
even though only relevant to one, and they can in any case be specified
via -with-blas=foo for some `foo' (cxml or dxml, I think).

> case a specific platform (or even in combo with a specific compiler).

Even though we are in feature free, zapping the following lines in
m4/R.m4 seems innocent enough:

if test "x$BLAS_LIBS" = x; then
  # BLAS in Alpha CXML library?
  AC_CHECK_LIB(cxml, $dgemm_func, BLAS_LIBS="-lcxml", , $FLIBS)
fi

if test "x$BLAS_LIBS" = x; then
  # BLAS in Alpha DXML library? (now called CXML, see above)
  AC_CHECK_LIB(dxml, $dgemm_func, BLAS_LIBS="-ldxml", , $FLIBS)
fi

If we do this, we need to add the info to R-admin.texi.

I had the same idea.

[Yes.  Plus take not that we modified the macro taken from Octave and
need to talk to JWE about it.]

Dear R Core Team,

I'm wondering whether it is useful that every package should allow 
for help(PackageName), giving some general information about the 
package (more/nicer than library(help=PackageName)). This man page 
may include some mathematical or statistical background, or contain 
a guideline for the package.

Cheers,
Martin

help(nlme) would be ambiguous then. 

help(package=nlme) already works, same as library(help=nlme). 

I suppose we could make it a convention to have each package contain
an Overview entry so that help(Overview, package=nlme) would do what
you want (or even help(Overview, nlme) if we switch the arguments
around), but someone would have to write those pages....

Subject: [Rd] Using konqueror with help.start
Message-ID: <6r8zixwza2.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

For R-1.2.3 on a Debian 2.3 (testing) GNU/Linux system I would like
to have help.start use Konqueror (the KDE web browser) instead of
netscape.  I can start it with

 help.start(browser = "konqueror")

but trying to search for terms from the search page does not work.  

My guess is that I need to configure javascript.  The default is not
to allow javascript at all.  I do not wish to enable javascript
globally.  Under Settings->Configure Konqueror->Javascript I have set
accept for the localhost Host/domain.  This does not seem to help.

Can anyone give instructions on how I can allow searching without
globally enabling javascript?

This is important to me because there is a long-standing wishlist bug
against the Debian r-base package that I could close if I could use
show that Konqueror could be used instead of netscape.

Meanwhile (and with a new help system planned, I mean until that is
onstream), you will find discussion of this topic in the R-devel archives,
and should note that several packages already use INDEX for this purpose.
Try

library(help=boot)

for one.

Hmm ... I raised the issue about help.start() support for browsers other
than netscape a few weeks ago.  I seem to recall that as neither mozilla
(bug) nor konqueror (feature?) can be controlled remotely in the way
netscape does, we decided to not pursue this any further.

It seems that all you want is getting help.start() to work and use the
Java search engine, but what good would this be?  The next help() would
not be able to display HTML output in the same konqueror windows ...

The R help.start() search uses Java and not Javascript. They are
almost nothing to do with each other, and are enabled independently in
Netscape.

Does konqueror have Java support?

If you run help.start using netscape you will see

`Starting Java'

Yes, but even enabling that globally still leaves the R search function
busted as I verified earlier on my work box (using KDE 2.1.* under
Debian 2.3).

Quite a shame because konqueror is my preferred browser. Real pretty
with the anti-aliased fonts.

Subject: [Rd] Memory management problem?
Message-ID: <OF83B710C1.C01800C8-ON86256A69.005C62ED@mmm.com>

I just ran into the following problem.  I am not sure what causes it, but
here is the scenario:

(1) I start R with 512Mb of memory.  (I am on an Win2000 PC with 512Mb of
physical memory)
(2) I put a couple of small functions in my workspace and I generate two
real vectors x and y of length 2^19 (542288) each.
(3) I save this workspace.  The size of the saved file is about 8.4Mb.
(4) I run lm to fit y vs. x using an 11 parameter model.  I generate a
couple of plots.  Everything is fine.  (BTW, this runs out of memory with
standard 256Mb allocation of maximum memory).
(5) I regenerate y (it is a simulated example) overwriting the old one.
(6) I run (4) again and I am getting:
     Error: cannot allocate vector of size 45056kb
     Reached total allocation of 512Mb
      This happens even if I run gc() after (5).
(7) Now comes an interesting part.  If I save the image right now the size
of it is about 159Mb although I do not have any new objects in my workspace
(there is a hidden object .Trace, but it is  small).
(8) If I do
     rm(list=ls(pos=1), pos=1)
      however, the size of the workspace comes back to almost zero.

I am not sure if this happens on Linux since my Linux box only has 192Mb of
memory.

Is this the new memory management problem?  Is there any way around it?

Thanks in advance,

Andy

No, it's an old one, called fragmentation, I expect.  There may be no
free space of size 45Mb, and remember R no longer moves objects.  Also,
the allocation over 256Mb may well be fragmented.

I think you have the solution already: remove objects you are no longer
using.

Or increase the memory allocation to 2Gb: since you have big objects, NT's
virtual memory should do a good job.  That limit is really only there to
avoid paging on small systems, especially ones with VFAT file systems
(you are running NTFS I hope).  You may still get allocation problems.

Subject: [Rd] Preview of rw1030
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0106131724020.1159-100000@gannet.stats>

I've put up at

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/RWin/SetupR.exe

a (15Mb) `release candidate' of rw1030.  It's a snapshot of the complete
release but not everything (especially the recommended packages) is in
final form.

I would particularly be interested in feedback on two points:

1) The claim is that utilities like Rcmd check now work on 16-bit versions
of Windows.  Certainly with the latest perl (626) I was able to do all I
tested, including installing and checking bundles, on Windows 98.

2) There are inbuilt capabilities to download files (and more), and
update.packages() can be run from a menu.  Does this work on old low-end
systems?  If not, does the alternative given in CHANGES work?

Also on anything else ... we will be doing more checking before release.

Subject: [Rd] expand.model.frame() fails when subset is specified (PR#979)
Message-ID: <200106141815.UAA16660@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Gregory R. Warnes
Version: 1.2.0, 1.2.3
OS: SunOS gsun124 5.8 Generic_108528-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
Submission from: (NULL) (12.18.36.49)


When using expand.model.frame on a model that specifies a subset selection, 
an error is generated on the variable used for the subset selection.  

Example:

> data <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10,z=1:10,m=1:10)
> model <- lm( y ~ x, data=data, subset=m<8)
> expand.model.frame(model, ~ z)
Error in [.data.frame(structure(list(y = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,  : 
        Object "m" not found

The patch below uses "eval" and "call" with the appropriate
environment instead of calling model.frame directly. This results in:

> source("/home/warneg/R-src/R-1.2.3/src/library/base/R/expand.model.frame.R")
> expand.model.frame(model, ~ z)
  y x z
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5
6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7

Thanks. This is also present in the current pre-1.3.0. Your patch
looks correct, but I wonder if the default for "enclos" should not be
environment(formula(model)) rather than parent.frame() as it is now?

(And wouldn't it be better named "envir"?)

Peter,

I was merely making an incremental improvement, your suggestions provide
additional improvements.   Go right ahead and make the changes.  [This seems
wierd, are you asking 
me, non-R-core person that I am, permission to make changes to the R source
code?]

Just for illustration, here's an example of why it is better to use  
environment(formula(model)) rather than parent.frame():

	> fun <- function() {
	+ data <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10,z=1:10,m=1:10)
	+ model <- lm( y ~ x, data=data, subset=m<8)
	+ model
	}

	> test <- fun()
	> 

With my version:

	> expand.model.frame(test, ~ z )
	Error in as.data.frame.default(data) : can't coerce function into a
data.frame

With the additional changes:

	> test  <-  fun()
	> expand.model.frame(test, ~ z )
	  y x z
	1 1 1 1
	2 2 2 2
	3 3 3 3	
	4 4 4 4
	5 5 5 5
	6 6 6 6
	7 7 7 7

Pretty nifty.  

-Greg

Subject: [Rd] read.xport() bug (PR#981)
Message-ID: <200106142225.AAA17768@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Aimee Teo Broman
Version: 1.23
OS: Windows 98
Submission from: (NULL) (162.129.145.115)


When I use the read.xport() function in the foreign library, the Rgui shuts
down.   My xport file was created in SAS ver.6, using the xport engine in proc
copy. 

R commands:
1. library(foreign)
2. lookup.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this works fine.
3. read.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this produces a window that says "This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down."  The details are shown
below:

RGUI caused an invalid page fault in
module FOREIGN.DLL at 017f:14c727e7.
Registers:
EAX=00000000 CS=017f EIP=14c727e7 EFLGS=00010246

The date on the foreign.zip file is 18-May-2001, so I believe I have the most
recent version of both R and the foreign package.  I would call this an
intermittant problem, except that I have this problem more frequently than not.
Yesterday it was working, but today it is shutting down the gui again.  Any help
would be appreciated.

thanks much,
Aimee Broman

Sorry, I might have made that more clear. Followups on bug reports get
CC'ed into R-bugs and stored with the original report, as well as
circulated via R-devel. I was just making a note for whoever might have
a better informed opinion than myself, as well as for the person who'll
get around to putting in the fix eventually (which might well be
myself).

All packages have a version number, in their DESCRIPTION file or via

package.description("foreign")$Version

I suspect this is 0.4-3, but please confirm.

We do need a reproducible example to make any sense of this bug report, and
for that we need fdt.tpt.  Could you please attach that file to your reply.

Subject: [Rd] R CMD check (PR#982)
Message-ID: <200106151929.VAA27886@pubhealth.ku.dk>

In revising the splancs package, I use R CMD check. After a number of
changes to various files in the directory tree, R CMD check fails at the
* checking for undocumented objects ... ERROR
stage as shown below. But running undoc() in R (pointed at the Rcheck
directory, not on the older version) doesn't show the same error, and grep
on the Rcheck R code finds the function. I ran undoc() under debug() too,
to be sure that it was looking in the Rcheck location, not the default
library.

PS: Specifically I was responding to Kurt's note re:
$as.points
$as.points$code
[1] "..."
$as.points$docs
[1] "p"
and doing work on documentation as well. as.points is (...) in both code
and docs now. Is it the ellipsis that is the problem?

the perl version check in the configurte script

would work.

Finally

usr/bin/perl -v | \
  sed -n 's/^.*perl.*v\([0-9]\).*/\1/p;s/^.*perl.*version \(.\).*/\1/p'

What version of R is that? To my knowledge we haven't used the
sed-based check for perl versions for more than a year:

Sorry, this was my fault, I mixed up R-devel.tar.gz with a very old
version laying around in my RPM_SOURCE Directory, ... I should have used
the version from my home dir.

sorry

Hi,
two small typos in `?write.table' (R 1.2.3)

In the doc of the append parameter:

 append: logical. If true, the output is appended to targshe file.
that should be "... to the file".

and in the Details section, a full-stop is missing after names:

  Normally there is no column name for a column of row names If

Cheers,
Stephen

Apparently, both of those got fixed on the 1.3.0 branch a couple of
months ago. (Before the release of 1.2.3, in fact...)

Thanks anyway. It's nice to have people looking out for this kind of
problems.

There was no Macintosh device when it was written, and when it was
re-implemented this was not changed.

Implemented for 1.3.0.

Subject: [Rd] approxfun(*, ties=) returning "random" result (PR#986)
Message-ID: <200106181035.MAA09201@pubhealth.ku.dk>

  Platforms  : SunOS and Linux, both using gcc 2.95.[23]
  R versions : 1.2.3 and "R-devel"

I came accross this when trying to debug a somewhat sub-optimal behavior of
ecdf() from package stepfun.
What happens is that  approxfun(*, ties = <function>)
does not always return the same result for identical arguments.
I tried "min", "max", and "mean" all of which are mentioned on the help page.
>From looking at both R and C code, I wonder if the bug is not even deep
inside where .C(......) is handled, or somewhere else ``deep down''...

I could debug more myself, but given the ``immediate release'' and my
limited resources, I'll pass this on :

###---------- the following is executable; read and follow the comments

n <- length(xt <- c(.4,.4,.4,1,1.05,2,3,3,3.4, 4,4,4,4:5, 7,7))

e2 <- approxfun(xt,(1:n)/n, method = "const", yl=0, yr=1, f=0, ties=max)
e2(xt)# all "1" (well mostly...)
gcinfo(TRUE)
## Execute the following (long) line a few times...
## the non-1 solution happens often (not always!) immediately *after* GC..
for(i in 1:100) {ee <- e2(xt);if(!is.na(b <- all(ee == 1)) && b) cat(".") else cat("\n",16*ee,"\n")}

## The problem happens only when  ties = <function>, not for ties = "ordered":
e1 <- approxfun(xt,(1:n)/n, method = "const", yl=0, yr=1, f=0, ties="ordered")
e1xt <- c(3,3,3:6,8,8,9,rep(13,4),14,15,15)/16
stopifnot(e1(xt) == e1xt)

## Execute the following (long) line a few times...
## -- no problem, always "........."
for(i in 1:100) {ee <- e1(xt);if(!is.na(b <- all(ee == e1xt))&& b)cat(".") else cat("\n",16*ee,"\n")}

...but yes, we almost forgot it again. Just goes to show the
advantage of using the bug repository when reporting.

No, the problem is that `n', the length of the x and y vectors, is not
recomputed when the ties are removed.  Thus in your example two 9-element
vectors are passed down to a C routine that is told they are 16 elements
long. Bad.

I'll commit the obvious fix after make check.

I asked Prof. Brian Ripley if I might submit some text/input for the
R-intro writers, he said this is the place to do it.

I was on a plane a couple of weeks ago reading R-intro as I plan for a
course and made these notes, some of which I think will help my students
if you incorporate them.  I've attached a raw text file I wrote in Emacs
to this message "Rintrochanges.txt".

I have written documents like R-intro before and understand it is
difficult to please everybody, and I thank you for your effort on the
project.

R-intro comments/enhancements  Part I.

I think something more verbose like this would help under
"Ordered and Unordered factors"

Texts on research design emphasize that variables have
different levels of measurement. Typically, there are three levels.
If a measurement is taken with a precise scale (one on which it is
meaningful to say new_value = b*old_value, as with readings of a
thermometer), it is considered an "interval" level variable.  Many
statistical models were originally designed for interval level
variables.  If a measurement is not so precise, but only provides an
ordered categorization of observations, such as "low" "medium" and
"high", it is called an ordinal variable.  If a measurement is
categorical and implies no sense of ordering, such as "European",
"Asian", or "South American", then it is typically called an ordinal
variable.  Assigning the values of "1", "2", and "3" to these
observations has no substantive significance, as we might as well
number them "3","2","1".

Many statistical models are designed for interval level data, but with
appropriate recoding of input, they can also be made to work with
nominal and ordinal data.  In the "old days" of statistical computing,
users were forced to create a lot of indicator (or "dummy") variables,
thereby converting information from nominal or ordinal measurements
into variables that have only values 0 and 1.  For example, to
represent the information about the home continents of survey
respondents, we might create two dummy variables, one for Asia (coded
1 if respondent is from Asia, 0 otherwise) and one for South America
(likewise 0 and 1).  A respondent for whom we find both of these dummy
variables equal to 0 is sure to be from Europe, so we don't usually
need to create three dummy variables.  Doing so would be redundant.

With a modern language like R, much of the drudgery of creating the
indicator variables is handled automatically if the user declares the
variables properly.  In R, and S before it, the term "factor" is used
to refer to a variable that is not measured at the interval level. An
"unordered factor" is a nominal (or categorical) variable, while an
"ordered factor" is the term for an ordinal measurement.  Many
statistical procedures in R have builtin procedures for handling
factors.

Beyond handling coding of noninterval variables, factors play a vital
role in many R procedures.  Procedures can be designed to do a chore
for each value of a factor.  Many procedures will in fact insist that
a variable be designated as a factor.

 ------------------


In this section "Named arguments and defaults", I am left in a
confusion about a few things.  This confusion has bothered me a while.
Can you do more to explain which arguments must be specified, which
are optional, and under what conditions is it necessary to include the
parameter= which calling a function.

1.  When I use a function, and I look in its help page, how do I know
which input variables must be declared and which can be ignored?  This
is quite mysterious.  When invocations leave out some arguments, how
does R "sift through" the ones that are provided to know which is
which?


For example, consider the page on "update.packages".  

Under Usage, I find:
update.packages(lib.loc = .lib.loc, CRAN = getOption("CRAN"),
                contriburl = contrib.url(CRAN),
                method = "auto", instlib = NULL,
                ask=TRUE, available=NULL, destdir=NULL)

I've been using computers a long time, and I use this function every two months or so.  Between times I forget, come back to this page, and still this one leaves me totally confused.  

After fiddling a while, I find this works on Linux:
>update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/library",CRAN="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN")

but what bothered me thd most is the "getOption("CRAN") option for CRAN.  I tried many variations on that and never figured how to make it work.


Maybe any clarifications could be related to the section "Getting help with functions and features"

In this section, I think it would be nice to have a paragraph about
"how to read a help page."  Some things are not obvious to all new
users.  Some things in help pages are tough to describe... Maybe I'd
say

How to read a help page.

If you find a help page, notice that it is made up of different parts.

1. "Description". These are usually terse, so read every word
   carefully.

2. Look for the "Value" heading.  That tells you what this procedure is
   going to return when you call it. If this procedure doesn't return
   what you need, you should find out immediately.

3. Under "Usage", most help pages list a number of possible commands
   that can be used.  These are not commands to be typed
   literally. Many of them contain abstract references which provide
   information about the nature of the variables that might be
   entered.  

   Here is a simple case.  The coefficients help page has this:

Usage

coef(object, ...)
coefficients(object, ...)

   Clearly, coef and coefficients are going to do the same thing, and you must supply the appropriate object.

4. Under "Arguments," the help page indicates what inputs this
   procedure wants.  The inputs are described line-by-line, and often
   the comments indicate of parameters are optional or what their
   default value might be.

   Many help pages have the infamous "...", which is something like
   "fill in the appropriately, depending on whatever context you
   find."  In some situations this is easy to understand .  Many help
   pages will eplicitly say that "..." refers to any options that
   might be used with a particular kind of object, and in that case
   one must find the help page for that other object. For example, the
   dev.copy help page clearly indicates that "..." refers to any
   options that might be used with the particular device in question.

   Other help pages are not so informative.  Consider the output from ?coefficients:

Arguments

 object
       an object for which the extraction of model coefficients is meaningful.
 ...
       other arguments.

Here it is clear you need to give a statistical object to have
coefficients removed.  The "..." is a mystery, and most R users will
try to use the coefficients command without worrying about it, and
then backtrack if an error occurs.  And, if an error occurs, there may be no recourse but to read the source code for this command or ask  about it in the r-help email list.

And the bug is?

The generic indexing should really be x[...,drop=T].  Methods for
specific classes can specialize to a particular number of indices if
they want to, which is what is happening here

> get ("[.data.frame")
function (x, i, j, drop = if (missing(i)) TRUE else length(cols) == 
    1) 

one could fairly easily slip in a "..." argument after "j", and then
inside the function give an error if "..." is not empty, but what
would the point be?

The point would be to catch errors like this

for ( i in 1:2 ) foo[i,2] <- my.fun( bar[,i,2] , another.arg )

that might otherwise pass unnoticed when 'bar' is a data.frame.

Subject: [Rd] par(mgp) bug (PR#916)
Message-ID: <200106190136.DAA15914@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi


> The behaviour of the third argument of par(mgp), which controls the

>
> In the following example, the plots should NOT be
> identical; the axis ticks plus the axis major line should be drawn one

This is more of an incompatibility-with-S rather than a bug.  In R,
axis(pos=) overrides axis(line=) which overrides par(mgp=).  It is possible
to get axis to respond to par(mgp=), but this is NOT the default behaviour.
For example,

par(mgp=c(3, 1, 1))
plot(1:10, axes=F)
box()
axis(1, line=NA)
axis(2)

In S, par(mgp=) specifies locations RELATIVE TO axis(line=), which can be
overridden by axis(pos=).

So the options are:
(i) become compatible NOW (for 1.3)
(ii) become compatible later
(iii) remain incompatible

I think we should do (i), especially because the default behaviour, which I
think would cover 99.999% of user code, would NOT change.

This is your chance to disagree ...

Hi

Bug summary:----
par(xpd=T)
plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.
Bug summary:----

I cannot reproduce this bug, BUT it did show up a bug in rect() -- in the
example above, the border around the legend is not drawn.

This is because rect() ignores par(xpd).  The default is rect(xpd=FALSE).  This
is at odds with text(xpd=NULL) and polygon(xpd=NULL) which use par(xpd) by
default.  arrows(xpd=FALSE) has the same problem as rect().  

I propose modifying rect() and arrows() to use par(xpd) by default like text()
and polygon().  There will, as usual, be a small risk that someone's code will
produce different output after this change, but this risk should be pretty
small.

Any objections ... ?

Coincidence, I *did* look at that bug only yesterday.
My experience:
   I *could* reproduce the bug {X11(), Linux-386}, but only a few times. 
   Then, it didn't show anymore. Even restarting R wouldn't show it again.
   My ``explanation'' was that it might be (a bug) inside X11 / Window manager
   handling of things... ??

It doesn't obey xpd either (PR#750).

Our Solaris compilers run this without problem: I've been running that test
most days.

We have

markov% f77 -V
f77: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 FORTRAN 77 5.2 2000/09/11
Usage: f77 [ options ] files.  Use 'f77 -flags' for details
markov% cc -V
cc: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C 5.2 2000/09/11
usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details

and I am usually running agressive optimization options, e.g.

CC="cc -xarch=v9"
FC="f95 -xarch=v9"

CFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -g"
FFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign -g"

asn that by default uses the BLAS in -lsunperf.

What is your setup?

I have the 5.0 Sun Workshop compilers, and I wasn't using any of those
optimisation flags, though Fortran is using -lsunmath.

I just did configure, make, with CC="cc -xarch=v9" and FC="f77 -xarch=v9"

I'll try again with the alignment flags specified.

The crash is caused by a bus error: address alignment. Recompiling without
-lsunperf and with -dalign fixes it.

I think there is a configuration issue here (not for 1.3.0, though). The
documentation for the Sun BLAS says that -dalign is needed, but the
default configuration is to use the Sun BLAS and not -dalign.

Ok.  Note that this part of the configure code is taken from Octave,
which used to be reliable.  It would be great if we could pass info on
problems and solutions on to John Eaton as well (in particular as I
think that at some point of time there was talk about adding the code to
the autoconf contrib archive).

We had a related problem last week, resulting in dropping CXML/DXML
support due to problems on 64-bit platforms with gcc (if I recall
correctly).

Hmm ...

Subject: [Rd] .eps form of the R logo
Message-ID: <6rae32j1zt.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

Thomas Lumley and I are creating slides for short courses on R.  We
are using the prosper style for LaTeX (see prosper.sourceforge.net)
which allows the use of a logo on the slides.  It seems to be able to
handle .ps or .eps files.  The only versions of the R logo that I have
been able to find are .jpeg.  Although I can convert the .jpeg file to
.eps in an image manipulation program like GIMP I would prefer not
to duplicate the effort of others.  Has someone already done this?  If
so, where would I find the file?

I will add that to R-admin.texi, though.

I am not 100% sure this can be automated.  For a start, there are lots of
versions of the Sun compilers, and Thomas' is not current.  Really the
issue is that the compiler flags had better match, and that is very hard to
ensure except manually.  My f77 man page does say

          If you compile one subprogram or file with -dalign,
          then all subprograms and files in the program unit must
          be compiled with -dalign.

and my system is current (re-installed a month ago).

This issue comes up with mixed compilers too: AFAIR gcc does the equivalent
of -dalign and so could not be used with S-PLUS 3.2 (or about then, built
with SunPro cc).

Just gcc on Alpha running whatever Compaq calls Dec's UNIX today. CXML/DXML
are compiled with a different compiler.


So the general issue is the you need to ensure that you use the same
compiler and the same flags to compile R as you used for the libraries you
use, or know the perils if you do not.  I've just added a warning to
R-admin.texi about that.

In the Rnews sources, on your machine, file Rlogo.eps.

I do teach my students not to put logos on slides, though.  They (and
frames) only serve to distract the eye from the real information.

--Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
--
--There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
--To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
--Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
--cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
--internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
--This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
--mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
--(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
--and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

I'm not sure if the warning messages 

Warning messages: 
1: variable 67 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  
2: variable 70 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  
3: variable 71 is not a factor in: model.frame.default(Terms, newdata,
na.action = act, xlev = attr(object,  

reported by model.frame.default (thru predict.rpart)
are correct in the following situation:

R> library(rpart)
R> querschnittMar01 <- read.table("querschnittMar01.csv", header=T, sep=";")
R> y <- querschnittMar01$diagnose
R> design <- querschnittMar01[, c("msd","ag","at","myas","an","ai","eag","eat",
          "eas","ean","eai","abrg","abrt","abrs","abrn","abri","hic","mhcg",
          "mhct","mhcs","mhcn","mhci","phcg","phct","phcs","phcn","phci",

          "blutdruck","groesse","gewicht","bmi")]
R> tree <- rpart(y ~ ., data=design)
R> predict.rpart(tree, design)

where "sex", "blutdruck" and "familie" are factors. 

The warnings are given from the following lines in model.frame.default:

if(length(xlev) > 0) {
        for(nm in names(xlev))
            if(!is.null(xl <- xlev[[nm]])) {
                xi <- data[[nm]]
                if(is.null(nxl <- levels(xi)))
                    warning(paste("variable", nm, "is not a factor"))


where

Browse[1]> xlev
$"67"
[1] "M" "W"		<- variable "sex"

$"70"
[1] "Ja"   "Nein" 	<- variable "familie"

$"71"
[1] "Hypertonie" "Hypotonie"  "Normal"    <- variable "blutdruck"


Browse[1]> nm
[1] "67"

and 

Browse[1]> data[[nm]]
NULL

BUT

Browse[1]> data[,67]
  [1] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W

 [38] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M

Subject: [Rd] write.table(* , digits = ..) ?
Message-ID: <15159.4638.203418.415545@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Can anyone think of  reason why
  write.table() 
doesn't have an optional digits argument?
Via paste() and hence the internal "as.character" equivalent,
it obeys the options()$digits setting ...
which is quite logical for the experienced user, but not for others who
just want to `export' their data to a portable format.
I propose to add that argument in order to help these kind of users.

Well, it *is* covered in the `R Data Import/Export' manual under
write.table, and I assume all you intend to do is to include setting
options(digits=) and reset?

Why would you get 
  ../../../../share/make/../../../../etc/Makeconf
(all in one)?

The ctest Makefile has

top_builddir = ../../../..
R_HOME = $(top_builddir)
include $(top_builddir)/share/make/shlib.mk

and shlib.mk has

include $(R_HOME)/etc/Makeconf

???

Which version of make is this?

Yes, this had me confused as well...

>Which version of make is this?

Ahem...:
alnair:~/src/R-1.3.0> make -v
Make: Unknown flag argument v.  Stop.
Oh well, this is chaotic. All I know about this make is that
alnair:~/src/R-1.3.0> ls -l `which make`
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     system        15 Mar 25  1999 /bin/make -> ../ccs/bin/make

It seems I do have gmake version 3.79.1 as well, but it resulted in the
same error.

And I can't find g77....

Best,

Whoops, no sorry, it works with gmake 3.79.1! (I configured with
MAKE=/local/gnu/bin/make, but ran /bin/make). But I don't know yet if it
will pass make check.

On page 4, "more commonly know simply as XML" should probably be "more commonly

Message-ID: <200106262348.BAA28121@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I got a double defined symbol when linking src/modules/internet.dll
because 
internet.c and sockconn.c include Rconnections.h (... and do not even
need
R_OutputCon).

One should possibly remove such a global definitinon from the header
file.
As a temporary solution I declared the variable extern in Rconnections.h
and 
added in src/main/printutils.c the definition (only this file and
src/main/connections.c really use the variable).

Um, that's definitely not in the code in the system you quote below.

Yes, but the problem is AFAICS in what your linker does, as my C books say
it should merge all the occurrences.  All our platforms on which we are
able to test do so.  I did think about this and look it up.

Given that you use a very unusual system yet expect code to work on it
unchanged, it would be helpful to us if you compiled the pre-release
versions from time to time and sent in suggestions before release.
`R is a collaborative project ...'.

The packages feature of Rgui is great! However it looks the directory structure
was changed for http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/, such that some
the packages are now under /rw1030 (e.g., VR) and are not found by
install.packages(). Thus the error message:

trying URL `http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/VR.zip'
Error in download.file(url, destfile, method, mode = "wb") :

Please don't jump the gun: remember that rw1030 is not yet on CRAN
and was not released when CRAN last ran a sweep.

That's a very temporary change to avoid people updating on rw1023 to
versions that needed rw1030, and it will change on CRAN tomorrow.


However, VR is already one of the recommended packages which come with
rw1030, so you don't need to install it from CRAN.

Um, no, the directory structure is the same. There's just no VR.zip
file in it.  VR is *inside* rw1030 so why would you want to download
it? 

If by any chance you are still using 1.2.3, packages that have become
obsolete(-escent) now sit in

Full_Name: Bill Kristan
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Linux Mandrake 8.0
Submission from: (NULL) (138.23.159.84)


I just downloaded the "unofficial" Mandrake 8.0 rpm from cran. So far the only
problem I've encountered is that my arrow keys no longer scroll through my
command history, but give ^[OA and ^[OB instead. Left and right arrow navigation
within a line is also broken. I checked previous reports, and when this was
reported in very early versions of R the suggested fix was to upgrade readline.
I upgraded to the newest available Mandrake rpm, which was readline-4.2-2, but
the behavior was the same. I was using the KDE terminal emulator, and tried
different keyboard layouts, but that didn't help either.

That would mean that the readline libs were not detected during the build phase.
I'd ask for a new build.

As a remedy, try running R within Emacs using the (outstanding) ESS mode.

The new na.exclude mechanism for linear models does not extend to
influence measures and diagnostics.

For the same reason, the plot method breaks for lm objects computed
with na.action=na.exclude.

x<-1:10
y<-c(rnorm(9),NA)
lm.influence(lm(y~x,na.action=na.exclude))

#Error in lm.influence(lm(y ~ x, na.action = na.exclude)) :

Subject: [Rd] prototype for structured exception handling in R
Message-ID: <20010628102442.A7605@nokomis.stat.umn.edu>

One of the issues several of us have been discussing over the last few
months is how to incorporate a mechanism for structured exception
handling into R.  A prototype of one possible approach is available at

	http://www.stat.umn.edu/~luke/R/exceptions/simpcond.html

It is also available off the developer page,
http://developer.R-project.org.

The package that implements the prototype requires R 1.3.  (It is
mostly R code but needs a few hooks that have been added to R 1.3 to
allow experimenting with this sort of thing).

If you would find this sort of thing useful please give it a try and
let us know if you have any comments or suggestions.

Version: R-1.3.0 
OS: Irix 6.5
Submission from: (NULL) (142.176.61.253)


R-1.3.0 was built on Irix 6.5 using gcc and MIPSPro f90.  This combination has
worked for previous versions, in particular R-1.2.3.

$ cd test/Examples
$ ../../bin/R --vanilla < modreg-Ex.R > modreg-Ex.Rout

This worked in R-1.2.3.  It looks like there were a number 
of cosmetic changes to the modreg Fortran sources since R-1.2.3. 
SGI MIPSPro f90 was used to compile modreg, e.g.:

   f90 -OPT:IEEE_NaN_inf=ON -KPIC -O2 -c sslvrg.f -o sslvrg.o

Regenerating modreg.so using g77 (e.g., $ gmake FC=g77 ALL_FFLAGS='-O2 -g')

We had a private report of this on Iris 6.5, and the resolution was that it
worked with optimization off.

This is the only platform reporting a problem, so we need someone to debug
it there.

This is related to bug #865, which I have discovered is a problem with some
of the very basic transformation code in R graphics (for transforming widths
or heights when there are log scales).  I have a fix for this particular
mtext() problem, but I'm still working on the more general transformation
bug.

Subject: [Rd] interaction() -- problem with drop (PR#1003)
Message-ID: <200106290030.CAA22337@pubhealth.ku.dk>


(R-1.3.0 on linux, alpha and intel; also tested on R-1.1.1 on irix.)

Below is a program that creates some random data (n, x, and y), creates a
factor out of x and y and then creates a factor z out of their interaction
(corresponding, with the default nf = 2, to quadrants, which is how I came
upon this).  It then runs an analysis of variance.

f.test.problem <- 
function(n = 100, nf = 2){

  t1 <- data.frame(n = rnorm(n), x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))

  t1$x <- cut(t1$x, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$y <- cut(t1$y, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = F)
  
  print(table(t1$x))
  print(table(t1$y))
  print(table(t1$z))
  
  summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
}

Here's the problem:  if none of the nf * nf levels of z is empty -- that
is, if there is at least one trial taking on each value -- I get the error
"Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type".

traceback() gives:

8: model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts)
7: model.matrix(mt, mf, contrasts)
6: lm(formula = n ~ z, data = t1, singular.ok = TRUE)
5: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
4: eval(lmcall, parent.frame())
3: aov(n ~ z, data = t1)
2: summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
1: f.test.problem(nf = 3)


However, if one of the levels of z is empty (which I'm checking using
table), then the analysis of variance runs!  (Easy to see if you use nf =
4 or even 3; it won't take long to get some examples that run and some
that don't.)

Creating n and z outside of a dataframe and then running aov(n~z) doesn't
help.

The problem does not arise if I do aov(n ~ x, data = t1) or 
aov(n ~ y, data = t1) -- the analysis of variance runs whether there are
empty categories or not.


Finally:  if I specify drop = T in the interaction call:
t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = T)
then the analysis works whether a factor actually gets dropped or
not.  That is, even when no factor is empty (and so I got an error with
drop = F), everything works.

So the problem seems to arise from something going on in interaction.  I'm
not sure what, and I'm sure someone else will see the problem faster than
I will.

Apologies in advance if I'm being dense and this is really how things
ought to work.  If not, I'll submit a formal bug report.

Message-ID: <200106290549.HAA22957@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Based on a report to the Windows maintainers from Richard Rowe
<Richard.Rowe@jcu.edu.au>:

NEWS for 1.3.0 says

    o   Exact p-values are available for the two-sided two-sample
        Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

I think the (new) p-values are computed but are backwards:

I'll commit the obvious fix unless anyone knows better.  Neither value
agrees well with S-PLUS 6, which gives

Thanks for doing.  I had received a similar private bug report but had
not gotten to fixing this.

Strange because the underlying algorithm should be the same.  Have you
tried R vs Splus on larger samples (say, 100 each)?

The facility was not put in for Computer Modern, but for other more
normally encoded fonts (specifically Monotone Times and Lucida).  The
postscript help page does say

     It is the user's responsibility to check that suitable fonts are
     made available, and that they contain the needed characters when
     re-encoded.

and latter

     ###  ---- Use TeX's Computer Modern fonts ---
     ## Only use alphanumeric chars here.

R has the encoding hard-coded in plotmath.c, which is *much* more
serious, and is why Symbol is hardcoded.

I don't follows this. Only a single driver users afm files, and it has
several versions (ps, pdf, xfig).  How would the below be relevant to the
Windows drivers, say.

`Patches will be accepted' I think sums this up.  No other program I know
allows the flexibility that is already in R, and that took a lot of hard
work, which I am not sure you have appreciated.

We tried to install R on our Sun Solaris 2.8 machine using gcc 3.0. During the
compilation,
we got error messages like:

You've forgotten -fPIC.  That should be found automatically: it is on
my Solaris 2.7 system using gcc-3.0.

Set CPICFLAGS (and probably FPICFLAGS and CXXPICFLAGS) in config.site,
make clean, reconfigure, rebuild.

Even though I know the Rd format might be replaced soon, I am report this just
in case:

The package optional argument for \link is *only* used when \link is in a \code
environment. Example:

  1) This link works: \code{\link[base]{cat}}
  2) But not this one: \link[base]{cat}

It looks like the "base" argument in the second case is not used at all. In HTML
this results in a "missing" link, i.e. the search page is called. It is 
interesting to use \link without \code for non-object help pages such as
"Introduction" etc.

It's a typo: line 564 of share/perl/R/Rdconv.pm should be

	my ($id, $arg, $opt) = get_link($text);

That really would not have been hard to investigate!

Yes, the documentation was clear on this. I was just hopeful that it would
work well enough to do all basic plot labels with TeX's fonts.

This might be a reason to alter the font encodings in the ps file to match
R, rather than try to change R. I'll have to look at whether it really
makes sense to do that in postscript, though.

I don't really know how fonts work in windows. Clearly this would only be
an improvement for output using the ps fonts.

I'm sorry that I gave the impression that I don't appreciate the work that
has gone into R. I really think it is a great program. It is just so close
to solving all the data analysis and plotting problems that I have had
that I am hopeful that a few small modifications could bring it the rest
of the way. I will look further at what changes would need to be made, but
I am a newbie to R, so I have a lot to learn.

Thanks,
