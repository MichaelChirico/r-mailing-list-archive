Subject: [Rd] Segmentation fault in recursion, 0.90.1 (PR#409)
Message-ID: <200002011212.NAA12287@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following gives an immediate segmentation fault, v 0.90.1

"fred" <- function(x) { print(x); Recall(x-1)}
fred(0)	# segmentation fault at recursion 831

Obviously this recursion is non-terminating, but shouldn't it be caught
and reported at some limit?  In 0.64.1 we had

Error: protect(): stack overflow

at recursion 831.  Cheers, Jonathan.

The development version has

[1] -162
[1] -163
Error in print(x) : evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?

The limit can be set with options(expressions=...)

Your wish is our command: the development version already gives:

[1] -163
Error in print(x) : evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?

The limit is set by options(expressions=), which at last actually does
something.

As the INSTALL file says, use GNU make?

The current INSTALL script calls ./configure if it exists when
installing packages, but does not check the return value from
configure.  I have my configure script abort under certain conditions
and it would be nice if the INSTALL script would stop at that point.

Also, is there an autoconf macro for testing for gnu make?

Subject: [Rd] Bugs and comments. (PR#410)
Message-ID: <200002021241.NAA25298@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi,
Here are a few errors I found as well as a few comments.

1) In the man page of par:
          lty: The line type.  Line types can either be specified
               as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid, 2=dashed, 3=dot-
               ted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one
               of the character strings `"blank"', `"solid"',
               `"dashed"', `"dotted"' `"dotdash"', `"longdash"',
               or `"twodash"', where `"blank"' uses `invisible
               lines' (i.e. doesn't draw them).

               Alternatively, a string of up to 8 characters
               (from code{c(0:9, "A":"F")}) may be given, giving
  -------------------^^^^^---------------^
               the length (typically in points/pixels) of line
               segments which are alternatively drawn and
               skipped.  For example, `"44"' is dashed and `"13"'
               is dotted.

2) I was trying to get the warnings to look as they use to do but even
  setting the option warn to 1 does not work. For example what kind is
  generating the following warning when a library is loaded???

  > options(warn=1)
  > library(eda)
  Warning: Explicit local dynamic loading not supported on this platform. Using default.
  > 

  Problem can also occurs with error messages:

  > a <- function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z)
      stop("This is an very long error message which will be difficult to see especially in a Microsoft windows version of R.")
  > a(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26)
  Error in a(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,  : This is an very long error message which will be difficult to see especially in a Microsoft windows version of R.

  Basically, in Microsoft windows you can only see about as much as "...  : This$"
  and then the rest is of the screen. As their is no horizontal scroll
  bar... the students are unable to see the error message!

  I personally, prefer warnings to be printed out as they occur, that way
  I can see what is going on. By storing the warnings in a an object rather
  than printing them out if there were more than 10 seems to me as the
  opposite thing to do. Indeed, if lost of warnings occurred it means that
  there is more than certainly a problem. This seems to be getting like SAS
  where people will soon just run something get a result and not even notice
  that a model has not converged (if there were 9 warnings of NA/Inf replaced
  by maximum value and then the no convergence message... they will all be
  stored and the user will not even noticed that the model has not even
  converged!!). This is especially annoying when teaching with students as
  you can imagine.

  As well, I personally think that too much is printed out about the
  function which generated the error. I think that its name is enough
  and that its arguments are of no relevance to where the error
  occurred and just make things harder to read.

3) I got the following error message from the plot function. 

  Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : x and y lengths differ

  Now how is this possible as the arguments of xy.coord are the following??

  > args(xy.coords)
  function (x, y, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, log = NULL, recycle = FALSE) 
  NULL

  As well if you do:

  >  xy.coords(x=response,y=time,xlabel="time",ylabel="weight")
  Error in xy.coords(x = response, y = time, xlabel = "time", ylabel = "weight") : unused argument to function

  It is pretty hard to figure out what argument is unused... it might
  be a good idea to print out which argument was not found.

Patrick.

Um. That's a way not to get a valid covariance matrix and hence no
valid PCA.

as in

princomp(x, data = NULL, covlist = NULL, weights = NULL, scores = T, cor = F, 
        na.action, subset)
?

It really is easy.  If there were not a feature freeze on I would do
it right now.

Good idea.  I'll try to have something like this in after 0.99.0 is out
(currently in feature freeze).

No macro, and I would have my doubts whether you'd really want to test
for that (we've been working very hard not to require GNU make for
building R).  But you could simply do

	moutput=`make -v 2>&1 | grep GNU`
	if test -n "${moutput}"; then
	  GMAKE=yes
	else
	  GMAKE=no
	fi

Subject: constrained optimiser doesn't obey constraints


 The constrained optimiser is calling the function with parameter values
outside the constrained range

 In this example the box is from c(0,0,0,0) to c(1,1,.5,1). The function
prints out  the parameter vector when it is out of range. This gives:

[1] "x= -0.001" "x= 1"      "x= 0"      "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"     "x= 1.001" "x= 0"     "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"      "x= 1"      "x= -0.001" "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"     "x= 1"     "x= 0"     "x= 1.001"
[1] "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN"
[1] "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN"
 repeated a number of times.

 For these starting value it eventually reports convergence, for
 some others it goes forever.

---Example code---

revise.mix.binbb_function(x,loss,no.inform){
    if (any(is.nan(x)) || any(x<0) || any(x>c(1,1,.5,1))){

It seems to be happening in the numerical gradient computation. If the
current parameter value is on the boundary then one or other of the points
used for the finite difference will be over the boundary.

This explains why the values are over the boundary by a consistent small
amount.

Your example seems not valid R (it gives me syntax errors, and with the use
of _ with no space around is completely unreadable to me: I suspect some
lines got split in the wrong place), so I can't run it.  However, I think
the problem is that you

1) Are not supplying derivatives
2) Have a non-differentiable function over the space.
3) Started too near the boundary (the finite-difference step is 1e-3,
by default).

and so the finite-difference code is not obeying the constraints.
Really you need either to supply derivatives or have a differentiable
function over a region a little larger than the constraints.

It should be possible to write the finite-difference code only to 
step into the region: do you want to do it?

Subject: [Rd] anomalies with call objects (PR#412)
Message-ID: <200002060016.BAA26878@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

..but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Thanks, I've had a play with some of these and they look good.
A very minor bug report is that the help for contour says that the
source is in `$RHOME/src/main/plot.c' but it is actually in
`$RHOME/src/main/plot3d.c' (might as well be fixed until someone
makes real documentation). One other thing is that the contour()
command will only draw contours where the x and y dimensions match.
I went through the code and found the check that generates the error
but there is no comment to explain why the check was put in there
but it could be a simple thing to extend it to rectangular grids.

Forget what I said before, rectangular data works fine with contours, just need
to get the x and y ordering correct firstly.

> z<-matrix(data$z,length(y),length(x))

should be

z<-matrix(data$z,length(x),length(y))

Sorry to bother you folks, I'm still learning this.

I would say that R has good plotting facilities and quite fast too.

Hope this hasn't been fixed already, I installed the SRPM from RedHat
so everyone else is probably ahead of me. When I use the correct log="xy"
parameter for the plot function, logarithmic plotting is working correctly.
Yes I admit that I found the documentation for plot.default after I tried
a bunch of other things and traced through the code. There is nothing wrong
with your documentation, it's just me.

thanks, but this has been fixed :)

0.64.2 is pretty old now;  the latest version (0.99.0) has lots more in it,
including changes to the contour() and persp() functions you asked about in
a previous email.

You also mentioned the GNU libplot library;  0.99.0 has some vector font
stuff from the GNU libplot library in it, but none of the device-driver
stuff.

I am working on an interface between R and the GRASS geographical information
system,
written in R, with no dynamically loaded code. I have written full examples, and
tested
then under R 0.90.1, both by entering example() for each function and R CMD
check, both
of which worked without problem.

Under 0.99.0 however, R CMD check gives a segmentation fault, but running the
examples by hand (X11 not PostScript output) doesn't: 

Core was generated by `/usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.X11 --vanilla'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

The examples do use MASS, spatial, akima, and modreg, and the first three of
these
have been REMOVEd and freshly INSTALLed, just in case, but the problem appears
to
be in the postscript output. If you might find it useful to see the code, I
could
make it available, but I don't think that you really need (!) to install GRASS,
unless
you know definitely that you do!

Hmm. This looks a bit nasty. You're hitting a segmentation fault
inside of an fprintf call, which likely means either that you're badly
out of memory (not really likely) or that the FILE structure "stream"
(alias "s" alis "fp" at 0x726b2e78) has gotten corrupted.

If you run the same example under the debugger, you might go in and
see what got corrupted (run till crash then "up", "up", "p *fp" to get
started) and see at what point in the execution it happened (this is
what gdb's hardware watchpoints are for...).

Subject: [Rd] graphics bugs: steep slopes and large values beyond ylim (PR#414)
Message-ID: <200002072332.AAA13284@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  Some of my students have uncovered some apparent graphics bugs in 
R.  I think they may manifest slightly different on different platforms/
with different display devices (they sometimes report a Windows graph
that looks OK but odd results on printing).
  I'm able to replicate similar problems on my Linux (RH 6.0) system.


1. abline() plots nothing, or a wrong line, when the slope is too steep.

plot(0:10,0:10)
abline(a=0,b=100)
abline(a=0,b=200)
abline(a=0,b=300)
abline(a=0,b=80)

2. when plotting with type "l" and with values far beyond the limits of
the plot, semi-random lines appear on the plot.

plot(exp(1:100),ylim=c(0,10),type="l")

Any thoughts?  I poked a little bit at this myself: abline calls GLine, neither of them
seems to do much checking whether the endpoints of the line to be drawn are way outside of the
window (I guess that XDrawLine, which gets called by GLine, can't handle this).
I guess this should probably be fixed at the the level of GLine (it might fix both of
the above problems, but I'm a little bit afraid digging this deeply into the graphics drivers.
  Maybe it will be obvious to someone closer to the code?

Just as remote possibility, but a potentially impossible bug source,
Signal 11 errors are often associated with hardware (commonly memory)
errors. Is that in any way a reasonable explanation?

(There are some interesting web pages if you search for signal 11
segmentation.)

Subject: [Rd] fix() changes character to factor (PR#415)
Message-ID: <200002080948.KAA16514@pubhealth.ku.dk>


If x is a data.frame containing a column of mode character, this
column is changed to a factor after applying fix(x).
Example:

R> x_data.frame(a=1:3,b=letters[1:3],c=c("hansi","pepi","karli"))
R> x$c_as.character(x$c)
R> is.character(x$c)
[1] TRUE
R> is.factor(x$c)
[1] FALSE
R> fix(x)
## I change "karli" to "sepp"
R> x$c
[1] hansi pepi  sepp 
Levels:  hansi pepi sepp 
R>  is.character(x$c)
[1] FALSE
R> is.factor(x$c)
[1] TRUE

Now, it is not possible to apply fix(x) again to undo your change,
because edit does not allow to introduce new factor levels.

Thank you for the report, and apologies for the inconvenience.

The fix I have come up with is to replace !arg by 0, so that branch is

On some platforms, va_list may be a struct, it appears.

configure stops when checking if cc and f77 "agree on int and double".
This is only due to a linking problem (linking fortran object with cc without
for_main.o complains about unreloved dependency to main.

Solution: add -expect_unresolved main to th linking step, see patch below

1) That is not the way to do that
2) The right way doesn't work either...

Character vectors in data frames will get converted to factors when
you least expect so, unless you protect them with the AsIs class,
i.e.  

x <- data.frame(a=1:3,b=letters[1:3],c=I(c("hansi","pepi","karli")))

Unfortunately, that will not work because is.vector is FALSE on x$c

The following fix to edit.data.frame seems to make things work:

    Is.vector <- function(x)is.vector(unclass(x))
    if (!all(sapply(name, Is.vector) | sapply(name, is.factor))) 
        stop("Can only handle vector and factor elements")

Anyone have a better idea?

(Of course the whole thing needs a redesign...)

Subject: [Rd] extra flags for cc and f77 on alpha (PR#420)

Im not sure if this is really correct, but it has proven to work.

1. It is always a good idea to add -std1 to DEC cc's flags to force 
strict ANSI language mode. It was neccessary for 0.90.x to compile, 
so I used it for 0.99.0 too
2. I'm not sure if -fpe3 is neccessary for DEC f77, but it seems to 
enable IEEE floating point exception handling (if I understood what 
was said in the manpage). Correct me if I'm wrong.

Both DEC cc and gcc complain (osf4.0, alpha) about applying
an unary operator (!) to a non scalar type (va_list arg) in 
printutils.c

I'm not sure if I understood what was intended by "!arg" (see below),
but with this patch I at least was able to compile. (and R runs now,
but I guess only because I didn't came across this code section)

Not going to work, "if (0)" will (i.e. always take else branch).

And please check for similar reports before filing a new one, we
discussed this at some length earlier today!

The problem is that you can't call va_list from another function reliably on
all platforms. It has to be treated very specially (in this case on Alpha it
breaks).

Just replace the if(!arg) with if(0) and dump the special case.

When I attempt to install the online help for R.99 on Intel RH5.2, I
get the following message

Substitution loop at /usr/local/src/R/etc/Rdconvlib.pl line 1589, <rdfile> chunk 171

and it stops after a few files. Each time I rerun it, it gets a bit
further and gives a different number at the end. I commented out the
line 1589 and it works.

In R.99, when you strsplit with a space (split=" ") as separator and
the string contains two consecutive spaces, "" is returned.

strsplit("  "," ")
returns
[[1]]
[1] "" ""
whereas it used to return character(0)
  Is this really useful like this?? It certainly messes all my code up. Jim

This appears to be a bug in the Perl included with RH5.2.  Adrian
Trapletti (and Fritz Leisch) reports:

   I had exactly the same problem, also under RH5.2. I upgraded to 
   perl version 5.005_03 and now it works. 

Perl 5.005_02 works for me on Solaris, too.

[I am just filing Adrian's report on R-bugs for the record.]

Compiling R 0.99.0 and GRASS 5.0beta5 on a different machine, also under
RH 6.1, and running the R CMD check for the package, showed that your
intuition was correct. I'm not quite sure, since I repeated the fault
several times on my home machine with more and fewer programs running, and
it always failed at the same point, so I'll still run CMD check through
gdb. I guess it's a hardware matter, though I haven't seen any other
behaviour in my home machine that seemed odd (not really, but I tend to
think it's me that's odd, not the machine!)

I'll pass on the results of gdb later.

Thanks for your help.

Duncan:

I'll check the site you referred to.

On the machine with problems, powering down and restarting, then running R
-d gdb, run --vanilla < GRASS-Ex.R - as Peter suggested, led to the same
sig11, which makes me feel that maybe it's not just memory, because R is
certainly loaded somewhere else in physical space with no GUI running, and
nothing coming from cache. If it's any help, a rerun with the GUI up to
copy & paste output gives:

(including the function where the problem occurs). The (FILE *) looks
healthy enough to me, so I'll accept that the problem is a machine
idiosyncracy. I'll work out a way for the examples to "know" if they are
being run from GRASS-Ex.R, and if so, drop most of the graphic output,
leaving it in for regular example() execution.

Thanks for useful advice,

I wouldn't think so! 0x20203665 looks suspiciously like a bit of a text
string. "e6  " to be precise (give or take byte ordering issues). And
the pointer is not pointing anywhere useful. I think something is
walking over  pd->psfp

Next step would be to find out where that happens. If you set a
breakpoint in PS_Open just after the R_fopen call, run to it and then
do a 

p &(pd->psfp)
watch *<address obtained from the above>
disp/x *<address obtained from the above>
run

and see if it stops with the memory location being overwritten

It is useful like that. It messed up some other people's code, too (eg
mine), but with the previous behaviour there was no way to distinguish
single and double separators. You can now do

	a<-strsplit(vector.of.strings," ")

to get the old behaviour (and lapply() is now internal C code).

Congrats on the new release.  The new package management tools are
great!

A couple of quick comments:

1) it might be nice to add an optional "Autoloads:" field to the
description (the package does not depend on these other packages, but
will autoload them if certain functions are called).

2) on page 3 of the R-exts document, it says to set PKG_* flags in
'Makeconf'; I think this should read 'src/Makevars'  (this paragraph in
general is pretty awkward reading).

3) I prefer PKG_LDFLAGS for the "-L" stuff and PKG_LIBS for the "-l"
statements (currently the docs say to put it all in PKG_LIBS).

4) page 5 of R-exts gives an example of using autoconf to enable/disable
R functions depending on whether or not a library is available;
currently it suggests putting a test in the body of the function that is
executed every time the function is called, even if the external library
exists.  This is confusing flow control with conditional compilation. 
Perhaps the example could be reworked so that the function itself is
defined differently depending on whether or not the external library is
found. (If the library does not exist, the function is defined to return
an error; otherwise define the function normally.)

Cheers,
Tim

Hi,
   I'm running debian - upgraded fully to potato at the start of the
freeze and added latest libgnome-dev before configuring.

   I tried compiling with gnome support with

and got the following output:

According to apt-get libglade0 is the newest version, so I'm assuming that

Congrats on getting 0.99 out, and on the rapid convergence towards 1.0.
Attached below is the latest email in a very interesting thread about
building GNU Octave with the 'Atlas' (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra
Software) libraries that are drop-in replacements for (parts of) Lapack and
the Blas. Speed increases of up to 10 have been reported for simple matrix
multiplication (this is over Lapack/Blas used by Octave).  You can find the
whole thread at http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/mailing-lists/help-octave/2000/

Subject: Re: ATLAS and octave
Date: Wed, 9 Feb 2000 03:05:13 -0600 (CST)

Here is all I did to build a copy of Octave that uses ATLAS:

  1. build ATLAS

  2. merge all four of the libraries that the ATLAS build creates into
     a single libatlas.a and install it in /some/dir.

  3. relink Octave by running

       make SPECIAL_MATH_LIB=/some/dir/libatlas.a

That seems to be all that is needed.

Would it be possible to modify the ATLAS makefiles to just build a
libatlas.a?  Then Octave could simply have

  AC_CHECK_LIB(atlas, ATL_xerbla)

in the configure script, and set SPECIAL_MATH_LIB accordingly.

Things might get a little more complicated for shared libraries.  Some
systems seem to barf when multiple shared libraries define the same
symbol.  But it would probably be possible to solve that, either by
doing whatever is necesary to tell the dynamic linker not to barf, or
by omitting the duplicate symbols from libcruft.

BTW, I see the following speedup on my system (266MHz Pentium II):

  octave:1> a = rand (1000); b = rand (1000); 
  octave:2> t = cputime (); a * b; cputime () - t

  without ATLAS:  94.4 seconds
  with ATLAS:     10.5 seconds

Wow!

Thanks,

jwe

Note that the Debian Atlas libraries are tuned for a P2-350 with 512
cache; which for us is fine, since our MOSIX cluster is full of them.
It might be less optimal for P3's and P1's, since it's supposed to be
(according to the documentation at the original site, as well as the
Debian docs, last I looked) built on the configuration at hand... 

Nonetheless, it might be a worthwhile thing to explore...

Subject: [Rd] Row subsetting of data frames (PR#425)
Message-ID: <200002091738.SAA09768@pubhealth.ku.dk>

If you want to use row names to take a row subset of a data.frame then
there is a bug when
- One row has a name which is a completion of another row name
- The shorter name comes after the longer one
- You want to retrieve the row with the shorter name

An example:

R> x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames=list(c("abc","ab"), c("cde","cd")))
R> x
    cde cd
abc   1  3
ab    2  4
R> x["ab",]                       #Works OK for matrices
cde  cd 
  2   4 
R> y <- as.data.frame(x)
R> y["ab",]                       #but not for a data frame
    cde cd
abc   1  3

The problem boils down to

>  pmatch("ab", c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = T)
[1] 1

and the code expects 2, which is what S gives.  The description of

duplicates.ok: should duplicate matches be allowed?

     If there are multiple matches the result depends on the value of
     `duplicates.ok'. If this is false multiple matches will result in
     the value of `nomatch' being returned, and if it is true, the
     index of the first matching value will be returned.

is different from S: the argument in S refers to allowing
duplicates in x, so

> pmatch(rep("ab",3), c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = T)
[1] 2 2 2
> pmatch(rep("ab",3), c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = F)
[1]  2  1 NA

A quick fix is in [.data.frame, to give

        if (is.character(i))
            i <- sapply(i, function(x) match(x, rows))

but I think we should make pmatch S-compatible.

Problem solved.
I was using dpkg -l \*glade\* to look for what I wanted instead of 
apt-cache search glade.

I installed the following packages:
libglade-gnome0-dev libgladexml-perl libglade0-dev

and everything worked fine.

See R --help. It is R --gui=GNOME, and that does work (in so far as
GNOME support works) for me.

Hmm. Should probably allow the alternate form in the startup script,
and for debugger as well. Did we really mean to make -g defunct, btw?

Yes, the "=" shouldn't be required (yet) anywhere, I think!

I think Kurt even promised to *NOT* make it defunct
(but still "deprecated").

It says in the NEWS:

    o   Long-named options with arguments such as `--vsize' now use the
        `--name=VALUE' form; the old `--name VALUE' is deprecated.

    o   New command line option `--gui' to specify the graphical user
        interface under Unix.  Currently, possible values are `X11' (the
        (default) and `GNOME', provided that GNOME support is available.
        Command line options \`-g' and `--gnome' are defunct.

which seems clear enough to me.  -gui GNOME never existed to be
deprecated!

Never said it did... However the point is that one gets an odd error
message if we don't catch the --gui argument, and while we're there
we might as well look for a following value.

Another options would be to have the script switch catch '--gui*'
instead of '--gui=*' and just let it barf on the absent binary. (The
sed bit should probably read sed -e 's/[^=]*=*//' then)

I'm no fan of removing short-form options in general. Whoever
disagrees should be forced to type "R --debugger=gdb" every time he
needs to restart during a bug hunt... ;)

                      COMPANY PROFILE

ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL is a leading producer of distribution equipment and one of the 
fastest growing private company of its kind in the Romanian economy.

The company is a specialist focused on distribution, protection and regulation of low voltage energy 
for residential homes, commercial buildings, malls, hotels and industrial facilities.

The line of products

* Switchboards for power distribution, control and automation
* Control panels for industrial processes
* Motor control centers
* Installation for power factor compensation
* Distribution panels and pillars 
* 19" enclosures
* Custom - tailored panels, produced and equipped according to the client` s needs.

The Production plant

Over 2500 m2 production areas, ensure complete execution of the switchboards, from the 
construction of the empties enclosures, continuing with the assembling of the electrical components 
and ending up with the final tests.

Given the fact that the company was customer-oriented from the outset, the flexibility required both 
in terms of design and fabrication could only be achieved by using the latest technologies and 
machinery.   

Loyal to this principle, ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL has launched a high scale investment 
policy, consisting in acquisition of modern machine-tools such as: CNC-machining center, CNC-press 
brake and installations for shielded welding (CO2, Argon) and spot welding, installation for powder 
coating etc.

As an innovative solutions provider, we have invested a lot in research and development and 
successfully launched new products, equipped with state-of-the art components such as: 
programmable controllers, static converters, process computers.
We even offer the planning, implementation, training and support that make everything go smoothly. 

Considerable investments in IT are being made to secure the company's competitive edge and 
growth in the years ahead. 

The components and materials used are of best possible quality, being purchased from renown 
companies from Germany (Siemens, ABB, Moeller), France (Schneider Electric, Akzo Nobel), Italy 
(Ansaldo, Microelletrica Scientifica, Lovatto) and others. Our clients are thus offered a wider choice 
and can obtain the most convenient performance/ cost  ratio.


The quality

The quality, one of the most important aspect of the market economy, was successfully taken care 
of,  by the introduction of the Quality Assurance System acccording to ISO 9001, verified and 
certified by TÜV CERT Germany (Certificate no.041007886).
The company has also been authorized by the Romanian Register of Shipping to execute panels for 
this particular domain of activity.

The people

We have built a world class infrastructure, as well as a successful team that sets the pace for the 
economic growth in the whole region. We also have a strong presence in Romania, our 
representatives cover virtually all the counties of the country.

At ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL you will find the availability of a flexible, dynamic and well 
trained workforce with unequalled expertise and experience; over 200 people work here with one 
objective in mind, to help our customers meet their business and technical needs.

matured from a local start-up to a grown up company  within 8 years. All of which leaves us in great 
shape for the future.

Long term commitment and in-depth know-how. These hallmarks have earned us an unrivalled list of 
awards, and more importantly the trust of our partners in Romania

So, at last a company you can completely trust. Now is the time to profit from us!

Subject: [Rd] gnome support fail on startup (PR#426)
In-Reply-To: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10002101002440.24489-100000@auk.stats>

Sorry folks,
   This isn't a gnome bug at all.  It has to do with make.

The binary is in RHOME, but /usr/local/bin/R is still the 0.90.0 script

The make failed half way through the install:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/demos'
make[1]: Entering directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/doc'
installing doc ...
/usr/bin/install: `../doc/html/search/index.txt' and
`/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/search/index.txt' are the same file
make[1]: *** [install-html] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/doc'
make: *** [install] Error 1

but because it was in the documentation section, I ignored it.
Dumb - I know. (for your info, /mnt/usr+/slashusr is symlinked to /usr)

This may have happened because I didn't clear out all the make after
failing the first make with gnome.

Dear R developers,

sorry about the empty bug-report that I seem to have filed earlier.
(I wrote it via `bug.report()' from within R using `emacsclient'.  I
wasn't aware that I have to save the file after pressing C-x # and
before sending it.)  Hopefully this time it will work......

I noticed the following problem with the on-line help system:

1) I start an R session and type help.start().  
2) In the web page that appears in my browser (Netscape 4.5) I select
   `Search Engine & Keywords'
3) For some keywords (e.g., htest [Statistics] and optimize
   [Mathematics]) in the Keywords by Section list, I get as result
that "no matches for XXXX have been found" if I select them.  But if I
enter those keywords into the text field that appears at the top of
the page and press return, the commands that are grouped under that
keyword are found.

Also, while playing around with these keywords and trying to figure
out what is going on (but, unfortunately, I don't know Javascript well
enough) I noticed that the new function `optim' has as keywords only
`nonlinear' but not `optimize'.  And again, if I select the keyword
`nonlinear' [Statistcs > Models > Regression > Nonlinear], optim does
not appear on the page of results.  But if I enter `nonlinear' into
the search text field, it appears on the page of results.

Cheers,

        Berwin Turlach

Subject: [Rd] R hangs sometimes and crashes (PR#429)
Message-ID: <200002111054.LAA01706@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Kjetil Kjernsmo
Version: 0.65.1
OS: Digital UNIX 4.0
Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.172)


I have the following R code:

ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

photonsincidenttodetectorbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds,
avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
{
  sc <- ampmean - ampmode
  if(sc <= 0) stop("Mean Amplification must be greater than Mode Amplification")

  ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
  return(sum(rgamma(ncb, ampmean / sc, sc) * rpois(ncb, avgphotonfromcloud)))
}



photonsdetectedbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud,
sensitivity, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(rpois(1, sensitivity * photonsincidenttodetectorbin(binno,
ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode, ampmean, numberofbins, linewidth)))

lensedprofile <- function(ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, sensitivity, ampmode
= 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
  return(apply(cbind(x1 =
-as.integer(numberofbins/2):as.integer(numberofbins/2)), 1, photonsdetectedbin,
ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, sensitivity, ampmode, ampmean, numberofbins,
linewidth))

And I have experienced quite often that in 'photonsdetectedbin', R hangs. That
is, while 
it normally takes a second to get an array with the numbers, I let it run for
550 minutes
on an alphaev6 without anything happening. It seemed that it hanged more
frequently for 
small values of ntotalclouds (<8000), but that may not be the case. Anyway, it
happens 
only occasionally, sometimes a call like 
 plot(lensedprofile(10000,1,0.1, ampmean=3), type='l')
will produce a plot instantly, sometimes it will not....
Just now, R crashed, and that is when I figured I should send a bug report...
ESS said:
Process R segmentation fault at Fri Feb 11 11:40:15 2000
Unfortunately, I haven't got a core dump, I've disabled them, I could enable it
if you'd like.

I hope running lensedprofile a number of times will reproduce the problem, but
you never know,
as I haven't been able to narrow the problem down. I haven't had any problems
with 
photonsincidenttodetectorbin, though.

I haven't found any other relevant bug reports.

Well, good time for a bug report like this as I have re-worked the
search engine yesterday (to allow more flexibility and automatic
creation of keyword lists). I see the problems you describe in the old
version, but fortunately:

Clicking on htest now lists all of ctest together with several other
pages.

optimize also gives a non-empty return (though function optim misses
the keyword, I'll fix that).

optim is listed under nonlinear in the new version.

Thanks a lot for the bug report,

Mmmh, seems as if I really should change my options as I seem to keep
sending off empty bug-reports ;-/ Sorry guys.  Here is the content
that should have been in the last e-mail:

`R CMD check nlme' fails on my machine.  The final output in
nlme-Ex.Rout is:

Error in nlme.formula(weight ~ SSlogis(Time, Asym, xmid, scal), data = Soybean,  :

I presume that `R CMD check MASS' fails for some similar reason.  The
final output in MASS-Ex.Rout is:

Subject: [Rd] behaviour of bug.report (PR#432)
Message-ID: <200002111209.NAA02992@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

it seems that I am in the mood of filing bug reports.  Partly because
R-1.0 is approaching fast, partly to explain why I have send (yet)
another empty bug report.  

My settings are as follows:
> options()$mailer
[1] "mailx"
> options()$method
NULL
> options()$editor
[1] "emacsclient"

My first attempt to send the last bug-report about "R CMD check
[nlme|MASS" was:

> bug.report(subject="`R CMD check [nlme|MASS]' fails")
Waiting for Emacs...Done
Submit the bug report? y
Sending email ...
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
Sending email failed!
The unsent bug report can be found in file R.bug.report 

Obviously, something didn't like the `'' in the subject line.  Can it
be escaped?

Next I typed:
> bug.report(subject="R CMD check [nlme|MASS] fails")

And emacs asked me if I wanted to revert the buffer of file XXXX from
its latest version.  To this I answered `no' since the R.bug.report
buffer still contained the messages that I wanted to send and a `yes'
answer would have put the bug report template into that buffer.  As
expected, I got into the buffer with the report still there.  Upon
pressing `C-x #' I got back to the R session and was asked whether I
wanted to send the bug report:

Waiting for Emacs...Done
Submit the bug report? y
Sending email ...

To my surprise, I then noticed that the empty template was send and
not the report.  I gues the "real" report was only in the buffer and
never written back to the file R.bug.report.  But I kind of wonder
whether emacs or R is to blame for this problem.......

Cheers,

        Berwin

Subject: [Rd] astonishing memory phenomenon
Message-ID: <000501bf7489$a0811960$a9021aac@joelschlaegel>



I have a question concerning memory.

I understood that R takes a fixed amount of memory at startup (which I can
influence with --vsize --nsize) and that gc() shows the memory still free of
the total memory reserved for R.

However, if I create a long vector of character data, gc() only seem to
reflect the space needed for a vector of pointers to char, the space used
for the character data itself is ... hidden!?

Here the data: I have 6 MB heap, and can do

> x <- rep(1, 350000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61034 250000  4.8
Vcells 350955 786432  6.0
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61036 250000  4.8
Vcells 700956 786432  6.0

which is using about 2.67 MB RAM for double numbers.

Trying for 3.05 MB fails (well, rep() obviously needs twice the memory, x <-
double(700000) works)

> x <- rep(1, 400000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
Error: heap memory (6144 Kb) exhausted [needed 3125 Kb more]
       See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.

Now character data, gc() tells us, that we need half that much RAM as
compared to double numbers.
for empty character WHATEVER SIZE THE CHARACTER DATA HAVE

> x <- rep(paste(rep("0", 0), collapse=""), 700000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)

Furthermore the last x successfully  created should contain data of size
700000*4096 Bytes corresponding to  700000*4096/1024/1024 = 2734 MB, which
is impossible given the startup memory, impossible given RAM, impossible
given that no swaping occurs, furthermore the OS (WinNT4) never shows any
additional memory eaten up except that taken at startup.

What's going on?

Subject: [Rd] Something strange in "?assign"? (PR#433)
Message-ID: <200002111222.NAA03218@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the assign helpfile (0.90.1) the "assign" function is

function (x, value, pos = -1, envir = sys.frame(sys.parent()),
  inherits = FALSE, immediate = TRUE)

which is not quite the implementation, which is

function (x, value, pos = -1, envir = pos.to.env(pos), inherits = FALSE, 
  immediate = TRUE)

This seems to have the following interesting effect.

"short.fun" <- function() {make(); ls()}
"make" <- function() assign("x", 3, envir = sys.frame(sys.parent()))

short.fun()	# gives an x as I would expect

"make" <- function() assign("x", 3)

short.fun()	# now there's nothing here!

But since I have simply duplicated the default value, according to the
help file, I would expect these two "make" functions to behave
identically.  Is this to be expected, and if not, is this because the
definition of "assign" is slightly different to that in the help file?

Many thanks, Jonathan.

OK, that's a bug, in the documentation.

However, it is not a bug that sys.frame(sys.parent()) gives different
results as a default argument and as a supplied one. One is evaluated
in the function, the other in the caller!

Try changing make() to function() {assign("x", 3);print(ls())}

Subject: [Rd] R CMD check [nlme|MASS] fails (PR#431)

To run CMD check on MASS you need to set R_NSIZE in the environment.
500k should do.  MASS passes here on Solaris, Linux and Windows, if one
is patient enough.  I will point out that information is in the on-line
R complements, page 11.

I have just tried nlme on linux and 0.99.0 and example(nlme.formula)
does fail there in CMD check, eventually.

What MASS does not do is make a PDF manual, and that is mainly due to 
problems with the definitions of what needs to be escaped in the 
.Rd files.  A new version will follow once that is resolved
(which may need 1.0.0).

Um, looks like nlsList is not failing gracefully when memory is exhausted,
presumably because restart is in use.

You only have one character data object, of length 0, 4096, 8192,
and lots of references to it.  You don't need multiple copies of the same
data.

Try this again with a character vector of different strings.

Object sharing, and more generally a copy-if-changed strategy.

Thanks for the explanation Brian!

This (definitely clever) behaviour of R makes it more difficult to decide,
HOW to import large amounts of data, if the data type is DATE. Dates could
be imported as CHARACTER or as DOUBLE (chron-objects).

Memory requirements of chron would be approx   n*8 Bytes
Memory requirements of character dates like "01/01/2000" would be n*4 + u*10
Memory requirements of character times like "23:03:20" would be n*4 + u*8
Memory requirements of character date-times like "01/01/2000 23:03:20" would
be n*4 + u*19
where n=no of cases and u=no of unique values

Concerning date-times from

  n*8 < n*4 + u*19

we get

  n/u < 4.75

as a condition for the chron object beeing smaller than a character
representation, thus the answer is: IT DEPENDS.

BTW: Is there any specific reason that currently we cannot have chron
objects as columns of data.frames?

As far as I remember, I did not save the file before pressing `C-x #'.
But then, I also did not change the buffer, so I was not asked whether
I wanted to save the file  after pressing `C-x #'.  That's why I made
sure that I modified the buffer on my next attempt.

I guess the following happened:
1) bug.report created the standard template in the file R.bug.report
   and called emacsclient.
2) emacsclient noticed that the content of the file on the disk
   differed from the content of the R.bug.report buffer and asked me
whether I wanted to revert to the version on the disk.  To this I
stated no.  But the content of the buffer was not saved into the file.
3) I saw the buffer with the text that I wanted to send and entered
   `C-x #'.  Since the buffer hadn't be modified, emacs does not ask
whether you want to save it too the file and just exists.
4) bug.report asks whether you want to mail the bug report and on
   answering `yes' mails the file R.bug.report which is on the disk.
In this case the empty template.

This description kind of convinces me that every part worked as it was
designed to do, it's just that it gave a rather unexpected result....

Cheers,

        Berwin

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10002110817290.953-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


I have done a little bit of poking around at the bug that I reported
earlier (steep slopes and lines from far outside the plot range doing
funny things), and have tracked it down to the fact that, as noted in the
Unix man page, XDrawLine[s] doesn't like coordinates that are outside of
the range of (-32767,32767).

Now the question is, what to do about this?  A quick "fix" (not a fix but
at least an acknowledgement of the problem) would check coordinates in
GLine() and issue a warning instead of trying to draw anything if any of
the coordinates was outside the allowed range (would one have to add a
per-driver piece of information giving the min and max vals?).

I wrote a prototype of some clipping code in R that I could translate to C
and stick into src/unix/devX11.c right before every call to XDrawLine or
XDrawLines.  Before I go to that trouble, though: is there a better way to
do this?  Is there already clipping code lying around somewhere else in R?  
Is there a way to do this generically (perhaps by adding an outer clipping
region to every device at its device-coordinate limits) that would
centralize the code and not require it to be repeated for every
driver/line-drawing call?

 Any thoughts?  I'd really like to get this fixed ...

Hmm.  I got it to pass on my Intel Linux machine.  I'll take another
look.

R CMD check nlme does require a large vsize and nsize and a lot of

The difference is not in rw0901/rw0990 but in the version of chron
in use.  There is an rw0901 version of chron 2.2-2 too.

That happens for me on Unix.  If there is not already a bug report, send one.

The hanging is happening under the current Rpre1.0.0.  It occurs inside
Rf_pois, called with mu=0.

Version: 0.99.0a

Submission from: (NULL) (195.7.239.50)


I consistently get a sig11 on one file:

gcc -I. -I../include -I../../src/include -I../../src/include/R_ext 
-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -mieee-fp -g -O2 -c fft.c -o fft.o
gcc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11
make[3]: *** [fft.o] Error 1

However, other files and parts of the tree compile still.  (When I had a sig11
being 
caused by a memory fault, once it sig11'd, it would sig11 again.)   I can even
do a
successful kernel compile.  Just not that one file.  I tried removing the ^L
from the
file with no effect.  I'm stumped and am grabbing the latest devel tarball to
see if
that does the same.

C compilers can do that all by themselves occasionally. Which version
are we talking about? Does it work to change the optimisation level
for the file?

Reducing the optimisation to O1 compiles it, but O3 still does
the sig11.  Thanks.  Problem cured if not explained.

Now that *is* pretty odd because I have

$ gcc -v

(Of course Redhat sometimes fixes bugs before making their RPMs...)

Currently, chron objects are stored as numeric vectors with certain
attributes (such as `origin').  I don't see how you could keep the
attributes ...

If I ever get to it, there may be a future version of chron based on a
struct tm like representation.

And I'd prefer to keep it like that.  As I think I already mentioned,
the naming is patterned after autoconf, which distinguishes

 - Variable: LDFLAGS
     Stripping (`-s') and any other miscellaneous options for the
     linker.

 - Variable: LIBS
     `-l' and `-L' options to pass to the linker.

You mean to have

  if(@HAVE_FOO@) {
     foo <- function(x) { ... }
  }
  else {
     foo <- function(x) { stop("...") }
  }

???

That's obviously more efficient, but (as far as I am concerned) not yet
optimal, as it results in ugly conditional code.  When using autoconf, I
think it is far better to use fragments, roughly along the following
lines.  In configure.in, do

  if test "${HAVEFOO}" = TRUE; then
    foo_frag=R/frag/code-for-foo-T.R
  else
    foo_frag=R/frag/code-for-foo-F.R
  fi
  AC_SUBST_FILE(foo_frag)

In one of the .R.in files in the R dir, you can then do

  @foo_frag@

and get configure-time conditional inclusion without any run-time
testing.

(I did not test whether the above works ... can someone please do that?
I will then modify R-exts.texi accordingly.)

Thanks,

The new version of chron (currently, 2.2-2) has added Y2K improvements
as described in file `Y2K' in the chron sources.  Roughly speaking, by
setting options appropriately, it is ensured that two-digit year abbrevs
continue to work ``correctly'' (using a cut-off mechanism to determine
the ``correct'' century).

Note that currently, chron/dates only supports formats like "m/d/y" or
"mdy" where all three signify (2-digit) abbreviations, or non-abbrev
formats such as "day mon year" where now month must be one of "Jan",
"Feb", etc. and corresponding versions with full month names.  A format
like yours, "d/m/Y" in strftime(3) notation, is not supported.

For example,

  as.numeric(dates("1 Jan 2000", format = "day mon year"))
  => 10957

as it should.

David James and I have had some conversation about improving chron.  For
him this is not necessarily high priority, as S-PLUS 5 has adopted their
own timeDate objects.  In R, we can either try implementing that, or
come up with a much improved chron, which would be my preference.  (As I
wrote yesterday, one idea is to use struct tm style representations for
chron objects.)  I will not get to this within the next few weeks
though ...

Meanwhile, it is always possible to write a function which parses the
given format correctly, and pass it on as the `format' argument.

there is clipping code in R (see, e.g,. CScliplines in graphics.c)

whether it gets called or not depends on the canClip flag in the DevDesc
structure.  If this is
false (0) then the R clipping code gets called, otherwise R gets the device
to do the clipping.
currently, the X11 device has canClip = 1 so none of the R clipping code
gets called.

NOTE that getting R to do the clipping serves two purposes:  (i) it clips
(wow !)  (ii) it prevents silly values getting sent to the device

a quick fix then is to simply set canClip = 0 in devX11.c

this is a bit of overkill though because we really only want to do (ii)
above

one solution would be to get R to check for silly values (e.g., clip to devi
ce extent) regardless of the canClip flag, which wouldn't be too much work
because the clipping code is all in place.

i think that would be preferable to making each device responsible for
checking for silly values.

Not to mention that it would break *text* clipping, which R can only
simulate pretty half-heartedly!

Subject: [Rd] More plotting comments
Message-ID: <20000214202323.A12789@ftoomsh.progsoc.uts.edu.au>

None of this is greatly important but might be a bit useful to someone.
BTW, I have 0.99a installed, it compiled without a problem.

I've discovered most of the plotting facilities including the legend()
function and the various text annotations, this is nice an convenient
and flexible enough to do most things. One thing that I must say is that
the help pages on plot() and plot.default() really SHOULD include legend()
in the see-also list because I tried all sorts of things before I found it,
apropos( "key" ), apropos( "note" ), apropos( "annotate" ).

Another tiny thing, is there an official way to put angles or temperature
on a graph? I have been using expression(90^o) for a 90 degree angle which
looks OK but kind of cheats the philosophy of the expression system.
Does anything matter other than how it looks when it prints?

Finally, when I do a plot like this:

	curve( sin, lty="12345678" )

I get a reasonable looking curved line on my X11 window but then I
do the same thing in postscript I get the interesting result that the
dashes are very tiny when viewed in ghostscript (5.10) but sensible
length on paper from the printer. Is this a ghostscript bug or is there
something non-portable about R output files?

An simple example of setting up an eps output for a report might be
helpful because a lot of people will be doing it. Just a suggestion:

ps.options( horizontal=FALSE, onefile=FALSE, paper="special" )
postscript( "/tmp/test.eps", width=4, height=3 )
par( mar=c( 3.5, 3.5, 0, 0 ), ps=10, mgp=c( 2.5, 1, 0 ))
curve( sin, 0, 2 * pi, lty="1494" )
dev.off()

I know it isn't as flashy as some of the existing examples but it does
demonstrate the typical things that you are going to need such as
point sizes, paper sizes, margins, etc. It is also something that can
quickly be grabbed and used by most people.

It looks fine here with ghostscript 6.0.  5.10 is rather old (yes,
I know it is the current GPL version).

I think it is better to set pointsize on the call to postscript().

And possibly confuse them. Not everyone wants to move the labels
around, and in general I think zeroing the margins is a bad idea.
In the technical sense of S graphics you want to include figure regions
not plot regions in other publications.  (In years of doing this
and scores of publications I have only once moved the axis labels.)

Actually, 5.50 is, but you can be excused for not knowing that
(released Feb 13....)

The plot looks OK in 5.50 too.

If your postscript viewer performs antialiasing, small features like
these will smear; try it with antialiasing turned off and see if it
looks more like what you expect.

try ...
    expression(90*degree)

also, for angles, there are ...
    expression(60*minute)
    expression(30*second)

the documentation for mathematical annotation (in 0.99.0) is quite out of
date, but it will be updated for 1.0.0

Subject: [Rd] Error report on empty matrices (PR#435)
Message-ID: <200002142012.VAA28984@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers:

When using R.0.99a (Version 0.99.0 Patched (February 9, 2000), source
compiled with gcc under SuSE 6.2) on a PIII 500Mhz Machine under SuSE
6.2 Linux I found the following bug:

  x <- matrix(0,10,0)    
  rbind(x,2)

causes an R-crash with the message "Gleitkomma-Ausnahme" (floating point
exception) which is probably due to the non-applicability of the
recyling rule.

The same occors when using
  x<-matrix(0,10,0)
  rbind(x,matrix(2,1,1))

The complete log is appended to this note.

In my opinion an error message like

  Error in rbind(...) : number of columns of matrices must match (see
arg 2)   

as it happens with

  x<-matrix(0,10,1)    
  rbind(x,matrix(0,1,0))  

should be given in both erroneous cases. 

Best regards 

      Ulrich Küsters

Subject: [Rd] Problem with expression evaluation depth (PR#436)
Message-ID: <200002142153.WAA29361@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jose M. Perez
Version: 0.99.0a
OS: Linux - 2.0.38
Submission from: (NULL) (159.90.200.68)


Hi,
I'm having problems with the check of
infinite recursion in the expression evaluation 
depth.
The problem appears in a program with no recursions
whatsoever. The layout of my program is a series
of routines called by a big loop.
I printed out depthsave in  src/main/eval.c
and it appears as there is an error popping out
the length of the expression stack, R_EvalDepth,
somewhere. As the loop goes, R_EvalDepth goes up
and down, but in average, it alway increases.

For the moments, I commented out the check with
options$expression and my program finished succesfully.
Any help would be appreciated.

Sounds nasty, but I think we need to have a code sample exhibiting the
behaviour in order to investigate it. Could you try shaving your
example down to something smaller which still has the problem?

The second case should have this. The first case should (I think) return
an 11x0 matrix and give a recycling warning.

That is, rbind(x,2) should append a 2  to all the columns of x.

I am reporting some problems with the autocovariance
function (acf) with the following facts:

First I defined a time series, x, which is a vector
created by x <- ts(rnorm(200)).  Then I plugged the
series directly into the acf function, acf(x) and an
error message popped up as:

Error in .C("acf", as.double(x), s.integer(sampleT),
as.integer(nser),  : C/Fortran function name not
in load table.

I did the library ts but the problem still persists.

That's exactly what I was looking for!

Exactly right, I'm using `gs' and turning off antialiasing fixes it.
I'm surprised at how different the line looks with antialiasing on and off,
I didn't realise the filter was quite so intense.

I guess there is something I'm not understanding here. If I draw a diagram
in xfig and export to eps then it exports exactly that diagram, trimmed
right to the edges of whatever lines are in that picture. Then I import
it into Latex which takes the bounding box and presumes everything in that
box is picture. Latex then adds a little space before and after the picture,
and centres the picture in the column of text. I add the caption under the
figure at the Latex stage rather than have it built into the figure because
that provides automatic figure numbering, font consistency, indexing,
references in the text, etc.

So from R, I expected to get a plot (as an eps file) which is trimmed right
back to the edges of the plot, then I can drop it into Latex exactly the
same as my xfig diagrams, put a caption on them the same way and get the
same spacing as other figures in the report. In addition, giving Latex
responsibility for the margins means that you get the rubbery glue that
juggles items to fit the page evenly.

I can perfectly understand that there are situations where users won't
want to use Latex, they might want to print a whole page of plots without
wanting to include it in a document or they might want to include it in
a different document processor (maybe something WYSIWYG where margins in
the plot are helpful). Formatting styles change in different disciplines,
for whatever reason Engineers tend to pack things in tightly. Anyhow,
I'm just providing some feedback from my own perspective.

And you will see the centring looks wrong, as the `box' is not centred but
the box plus text on the left only. Professionals tell me this is a common
mistake by LaTeX users.  (Actually, LaTeX does not add any space
before or after the picture, although your macro package might, and the
`center' environment does. The standard graphics inclusion mechanism,
graphicx, builds a TeX box exactly enclosing the bounding box.)

There is too little information here: please use bug.report() to submit bug
reports, and give the exact code you used so we can try exactly the same
thing. A good quick test is to run

library(ts)
example(acf)

However,

library(ts)
x <- ts(rnorm(200))
acf(x)

also works on all my (0.90.1 from a later message) systems, so I suggest
you re-build and re-install R, and run make check as that will run the acf
examples.

Subject: [Rd] rpois gives a large number repeatedly (PR#439)
Message-ID: <200002151118.MAA04594@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Kjetil Kjernsmo
Version: 0.65.1

Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.172)


I'm experiencing problems with rpois. Occasionally, it draws a very high
number.
Yeah, I know, this is statistics, things like that does happen, but this really

strange because a poisson distribution with a parameter of 3 shouldn't see the 
number 1932 very often, but the same, incredibly high number is drawn
repeatedly.

These are the two relevant functions, the latter somewhat expanded for debugging
purposes.

ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

photonsincidenttodetectorbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds,
avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
{
  sc <- ampmean - ampmode
  if(sc <= 0) stop("Mean Amplification must be greater than Mode Amplification")

  ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
  rg <- rgamma(ncb, ampmean / sc, sc)
  rp <- rpois(ncb, avgphotonfromcloud)
  dr <- rg * rp
  if(sum(dr) > 25000) print(cbind(rg, rp, dr, avgphotonfromcloud, ncb))
  return(sum(dr))
}

The if-line is included to trigger unusual events, and I just had output like
this:
 [683,] 2.09611150 1932 4.049687e+03    3 1682.063

 [694,] 1.74437433 1932 3.370131e+03    3 1682.063
 [695,] 0.71229856    1 7.122986e-01    3 1682.063
 [696,] 4.08736383    1 4.087364e+00    3 1682.063

 [699,] 0.81551877 1932 1.575582e+03    3 1682.063

Actually, it seems like this large number may dependent of the session one is
in. 
I get 1932 on an XP1000 with an 500MHz alphaev6, but on my own computer, which
is an PWS500au with
an 500MHz alphaev56, I have seen the number 11344 repeatedly. It could of course
be the 
seed or something, I guess.

I can't seem to generate anything unusual with the latest R snapshot.
Perhaps it would help if you told us what parameters to call
photonsincidenttodetectorbin with?

Yep, it's old.... When v1.0.0 comes, I guess I'll get the UNIX people to
install it.

It is really strange, this. I can do

Whoops, sorry, I use 
x <- cbind(-50:50)
apply(x, 1, photonsincidenttodetectorbin, 100000, 3)

Anyway, coming back from lunch, I was unable to reproduce it with this
call, after trying about 50 times... This call made the problem show up
almost every time half an hour ago. I bet there is someone sitting inside
the computer having a good time right now... :-) However, I was able to
reproduce it once in about 10 trails by calling 
plot(lensedprofile(100000,3,1), type='l')
which is a function defined by the rest of my code, that I have attached. 

Best,

Kjetil

thus I tend to see it as a bug, because it may break old code.

Still, I don't know whether it is approbriate to send a bug report to
r-bugs@lists.r-project.org ?

There's an "Add-Ons" slot in the bug repository. We're not forcing package
managers to actually read it and go fix their bugs, though...

I can't reproduce this with either of my pre1.0.0 versions, but I can
reproduce it with a 13/10/99 0.90devel version (ie, just a few weeks
past 0.65.1)

It looks as if the bug has been stomped since then. I can't see how,
though.  Looking at cvs diff I don't see any changes in the logic between
then and the mu<=0 fix a few days ago.

I spoke too soon -- There is an operating system or hardware issue
involved

Today's pre1.0.0 reproduces Kjetil's bug on Solaris 2.7 with
 f77: WorkShop Compilers 5.0 98/12/15 FORTRAN 77 5.0
and
 gcc 2.95.2
On the same machine, but (I think) with earlier versions of both compilers
the bug also happens using a 13 Sept R-devel snapshot.

The bug does not happen with today's pre1.0.0 on Debian Linux
2.2.13-mosix, gcc 2.95.2,  GNU Fortran 0.5.25 19991030 

The fact that the _same_ large number is returned suggests some sort of
memory protection problem, though the machine-dependence doesn't.

The code has (plot3d.c, ca line 718)

		/* Need to send labels in from interpreted R code ? */
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.00f ", zc);

so, yes, it is printed as an integer, and the comment there is right.  
I guess the labels should be format(levels) by default, to ensure that
the use of trailing zeros is consistent, but it should be in R code
so users can override the default precision, say.

Subject: [Rd] rug() extends axes instead of clipping (PR#442)
Message-ID: <200002160937.KAA16786@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

I noticed that rug() may extend the line of the horizontal axis beyond
the left and right vertical axes.  The following snippet illustrates
the problem:

set.seed(2241)
dat <- rnorm(10) 
plot(c(-2,2),c(0,0.5),type="n", xlab="", ylab="")
rug(dat)

The problem seems to be that:
> range(dat)
[1] -2.739635  1.037512

Cheers,

        Berwin

The docs to rle state that it works for vectors whereas it only works

changed. The latter is easy: change the diff != 0 to a shifted logical

Pre-0.65.1 workspaces? I had not envisaged anyone would still have those.

Fix: in GetRNGstate in RNG.c add the second line of

	default:
	    RNG_kind = RNG_DEFAULT; N01_kind = 0;
	    error(".Random.seed[1] is NOT a valid RNG kind (code)");

Thanks for finding the relevant piece of code.  I did look, but wasn't
au fait enough with C or the R way of doing things to spot the relevant
piece.

How about replacing:
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.00f ", zc);
by:
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.9g ", zc);

It seems to do what I want, and not behave any differently from before
for integer contour lines.

Graphics/442 talks about rug() extending the axis when the range of new values
is bigger than the plot.  This also happens if there are NAs in the data:

x <- c(rnorm(10),NA)
hist(x)
rug(x)

will make the x axis extending off the page to the left.  This seems to be a bug
in axis(at=x), which should either ignore missing values or abort.

I know that the use of a ***character*** matrix is not documented for

Thanks for the report: now fixed. rbinom was only checking if p was
unchanged, and not setting up correctly if n changed too.

[Directed back to R-bugs, and please keep it there!]

OK, there are two issues here:

(a) matrix subscripting doesn't work with character type. Plain and
simple. A matrix subscript just get flattened into a character vector
and then used for subscripting. We might want to give an error instead
or simply implement the expected behaviour, but not this close to a
major release, I think. (Splus cant do this either)

(b) There's a bug in string indexing:

  x<-1:2
  x[c("2","2")]<-2
  x

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. <etc>

It seems to happen only when there are repeated indices. The bug is
that the names component of x which is originally empty isn't filled
with "" for the first elements as it usually is but has NULL (0x0)
pointers there.

Will dig deeper...

I think that is the correct behaviour. (What is the expected
behaviour?  It is what I expected.) A k-index (aka matrix or array
subset) is supposed to give the indices of the elements to be
extracted/replaced. I suppose character values could be matched to
dimnames, but that would be a new idea.  We might want to *warn*.

On the other hand, S-PLUS's print routine seems to ignore the added
elements, and R loses the dim attribute.

repeated *new *indices.

The hackery in StringSubscript was copying the wrong string as a name
for duplicate string indices. Fixed.

Right.

As usual when length and dims develops a mismatch... R is saner, I think

So did I but not correctly (had indexnames instead of s). Thanks.

Subject: [Rd] splitstr documentation problem (PR#451)
Message-ID: <200002182127.WAA14595@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Using the patched version of R-0.99.0, I cannot reproduce the following
example from the strsplit  documentation:

(Example)
unlist(strsplit("a.b.c", "."))  
## [1] "" "" "" "" "" 
## Note that `split' is a regexp!  
## If you really want to split on `.', use
unlist(strsplit("a.b.c", "\."))
## [1] "a" "b" "c"

The problem is in the second example; the "\." should be "\\."  

Thanks for the great software.

Subject: [Rd] problem with glm (PR#452)
Message-ID: <200002190151.CAA15336@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

(Two suggestions which are in the current snapshot follow. Looks like
what is which header varies a bit.)

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

#define STDC_HEADERS 1

at the top of regex.c.  (I am not convinced that is the cause here.)

Normal, on a platform with xdr.

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

Dear R-helpers,
	with R-0.99a, Linux, Red-Hat 6.1 derivat (Halloween Linux) I have
the following Problem with this code:

graphics.off()

                 byrow=T )                         
split.screen(temp)
plot(1:100)
screen(2)
plot(1:100)
close.screen(all=T)
dev.print(postscript,"/tmp/xx.ps")


system("gv /tmp/xx.ps &",T)

fails with (gv Version 3.5.8):

I fixed this earlier today (for 1.0.0, as it was in the R-bugs database as
PR# 378).  You need a screen to split!  So for now precede
split.screen(temp) by plot.new() or frame() or explicitly open a graphics
device.

Your example works on the current snapshot.

This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

I'm impressed with all the new options for RNG setting (although, I now
have to re-work the way I was doing some of this). Would it be possible
to add  "default" as a legitimate value for kind and normal.kind in
RNGkind and set.seed? This would be used to set things back to R's
default settings (which may change from time to time with new versions).

Yes, added that. We do not intend to change the defaults again, but
someone may discover something wrong with what we have.

Subject: [Rd] reproducing Box-Muller numbers
Message-ID: <38B2D4D9.5B4A0C50@bank-banque-canada.ca>

There seems to be a minor problem with reproducing numbers from rnorm with
Box-Muller. The pattern suggests it might have something to do with the value
that gets dropped when an odd number of numbers is requested. (Details below.)

Also, could "user-supplied" be added as an option for normal.kind in RNGkind.
I'm sure the Box-Muller in R is better than my own attempt, but I would like to
be able to reproduce results I've obtained in the past.

Yes, it is. I wouldn't recommend that generator, but Martin M requested it
(and for .Random.seed to store the normal type).

I'll make a call to set.seed clear the saved value. That's all we intend to
be reproducible, setting the state by set.seed.

Not very easily, and we are in feature freeze for 1.0.0 now, so not before
1.1.0. It would be easy to patch in your own version, but the 
difficulty is to add all the protection needed for user-supplied code.

I'm  not sure what you mean by this. Are you suggesting that setting
.Random.seed directly is not intended to give reproducible results? I presume
not, but if so, then set.seed needs better control over the seed (i.e. vector
seeds).

When are you expecting 1.1.0? I can easily patch the version used by my library,
but for obvious reasons I would prefer not to post a library that does this. A
very large number of my code tests do not work if I cannot reproduce previous
rnorm random numbers.

Users are not expected to set .Random.seed directly, period. set.seed()
sets one of 2^32 separate seeds: why do you need more?

1.1.0 is not yet announced, but the feature freeze for 1.0.0 has been for
several weeks (on developer.r-project.org). I presume the numbers you want
to reproduce were not standard R before?

I've been using the same random numbers since R 0.49, the last time the uniform
RNG was modified. Before that I was using the same numbers since R 0.16. There
was considerable discussion when the change was made in 0.49 and it was agreed
that in future there would be an effort to make the numbers reproducible. I
certainly agree with improvements, but if you mess up reproducibility you are on
a very slippery slope.

My tests set "Wichmann-Hill", and mostly set the seed to c(979,1479,1542), which
I previously
could do with set.seed, but that has changed in 0.99.

>I presume the numbers you want

I'm not sure what you mean by standard R before, but I have been using my own
version of Box-Muller so that I can be sure to be able to work around changes in
rnorm. I can still do that but for obvious reasons I would prefer not to post a
library that takes control of that part of R.

If you use set.seed and then run, there is reproducibility, It is *not*
messed up.  What is not guaranteed is that user manipulation of
.Random.seed will work unless you stick to the previous options.
There is 100% backwards compatibility.

There was no set.seed prior to 0.99.0!  If you set the .Random.seed to
c(0,979,1479,1542), you will get the same results as before, but without
the warning that has been there for a year now that you needed the zero.

So, no change. Anything you could do in 0.63.1 you can do in 0.99.0.
If you want to take advantage of the new facilities, you need to heed the
current documentation.

I presume that I misunderstand something, but if I do not then I think
there is a serious problem for the way many people actually use RNGs
(rather than studying or testing them). To summarize the way I
understand the documentation and what you have said:

1/ Directly setting the .Random.seed is not something that users should
do and will not in the future be guaranteed to put the RNG into a state
that would reproduce a sequence of random numbers. Users should use
set.seed to put the RNG in a known state. (BTW, I was using my syskern
library version of set.seed before, which just set .Random.seed. Sorry
about the confusion.)

2/ set.seed takes only a single integer as an argument, so there is no
guaranteed way to query the state of the RNG at any given time, and then
reset it to that state at a later time.

If this second point is true, then I fear there is a serious problem.

It is guaranteed to reproduce it, but not to be a valid state if it
were never generated.  So replace `known' by `valid'.

Yes, there is an almost guaranteed way, but only if you restore a previous
value of .Random.seed. The problem is that for complicated generators it is
almost impossible to check if the supplied value is a reasonable one,
so we don't.

The exceptions are non-stateless variate generators, and the Box-Muller one
is such and has a warning to that effect, now:

Note:

     `.Random.seed' saves the seed set for the uniform random-number
     generator, at least for the system generators. It does not
     necessarily save the state of other generators, and in particular
     does not save the state of the Box-Muller normal generator. If you
     want to reproduce work later, call `set.seed' rather than set
     `.Random.seed'.

Incidentally, changes to both rpois and rbinom mean that you may get
different numbers of uniforms drawn and hence different results in the
future. That's life, I am afraid.

I thought Box-Muller just transformations uniform numbers? Does its
state just refer to whether an even or odd number of numbers have been
produced, and in the later case keep the last one for using the next
time?

>If you want to reproduce work later, call `set.seed' rather than set
`.Random.seed'.

But then I'm back to the original problem (which fortunately does not
seem to be a problem for the uniform generator): Using B-M for rnorm I
can't query the state at any given time and then reliably reset to that
state?

Yes. So use a more reliable option for norm_rand.

ok.  It seems that reliable here refers to the fact that the implementation does
not allow the state of the Box-Muller generator to be queried. I'm not an expert
on these things. Would you recommend one of the the other normal generators on a
theoretical basis too?

Problem seems to be that mnhyper as defined doesn't like extreme
arguments, and is being called with

 1/.Machine$double.eps

e.g.

> get("mnhyper",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[2]])(1000000000000000)
[1] NaN
> get("mnhyper",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[2]])(100000000000000)
[1] 21

The code looks like this:

    if (ncp == 0) 
        return(lo)
    if (ncp == Inf) 
        return(hi)
    q <- lo:hi
    d <- dhyper(q, m, n, k) * ncp^(0:(hi - lo))

And I suspect that the test should be ncp^(hi-lo)==Inf.

Seems to work:

> fisher.test(matrix(c(1,20,246,6873),2),hybrid=F)

Interesting. I never thought of the normal generator compensating for
deficiencies in the uniform. Thanks.

P.S. (Still please add "user-supplied" as an optional normal.kind in 1.1 if
possible. I would like to be able to run my old tests without my library taking
over parts of R base.)

Yes, I have it on the list.  (As you may appreciate, 1.0.0 on 29 Feb is
rather higher up!)  Depending how easy it is, it may make 1.0.x.

Subject: [Rd] bug and fix : using panel.first with plot() in do.call() (PR#457)
Message-ID: <200002251419.PAA13937@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following works as expected
        plot(1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
and if
        my.panel<-function() grid(2,2)
then
        plot(1:5, panel.first=my.panel() )
is also OK

but, 
        do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
        do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel)) 
        do.plot("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel() ))
do not draw the grid because the panel.first expression is evaluated
before the plot gets drawn.


A solution is to modify plot.default such that the line

panel.first
is replaced by

if(is.function(panel.first)) {
        panel.first()
}else {
        panel.first
}
This allows the previous behaviour, but also allows a function name to
be passed to plot using do.call()
now all the following produce the expected graph
plot(1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
plot(1:5, panel.first=my.panel())
plot(1:5,panel.first=my.panel)

do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel ))

Similarly the line 

panel.last 
should be replaced by 
if(is.function(panel.last)) {
        panel.last()
} else {
panel.last
}

As far as I am aware this affects all recent versions.
Cheers, Colin.

Yes, and a solution is

         do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=quote(grid(2,2))))

as when you do this sort of thing you can't rely on lazy evaluation.
replacing `quote' by `delay' will also work.  The help page says
they should be unevaluated expressions.

Um, ?plot.default say panel.first and panel.last should be *expressions*
*to be evaluated*, so is this not working as documented?

Subject: [Rd] lambda==0 in dpois() (PR#459)
Message-ID: <200002251927.UAA16322@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  The nice new log=TRUE option in dpois appears to mess up the
case where lambda=0 (I was trying to calculate the likelihood
of a saturated model).  Because the behavior is now always to
calculate the probability in terms of exp(log(prob)), there's
a test for lambda<=0 which really needs to be only lambda<0.

  dpois(0:5,0)

ought to give

 1 0 0 0 0 

but gives NaNs instead.

  Here's a patch to src/nmath/dpois.c that appears to work (although it could ? be more
elegant).

Thanks. We may just be able to squeeze that one in before 1.0.0. But
shouldn't it return -Inf  (ML_NEGINF) for the log case rather than NaN?

  I think you're right.
  By the way, it looks like qpois() may be subject to a similar problem,
although I haven't dug in.  Don't know about any of the other
distributions (dbinom() looks OK).

dataset$MACDhist <- dataset$MACDfast - dataset$MACDslow

Something seems wrong if you have an underscore in the dataname.  I think
this is a valid name and shouldnt need to be escaped inside of "".

No, it's not a valid name. The underscore is a synonym for the assignment
operator <-, and so needs to be quoted if you use it. 

If you think this is horrible you're quite right, but the S language
allows _ for <- and many people are used to it.

The commonest S usage is MACD.fast, though some people use capital letters
for embedded words -- MACDFast. Both are used in the base R package:
as.vector(), getOption().

I just wanted to install the rpm package with rpm --v -i [file], and here is the
log:
(I DID run it as root!!)
(the important thing is in the end: there must be a bug in the post install
script.
The problem is, that it does install all the files, but it doesn't correctly
hang
the whole thing into the system. No binaries can be run, it always says things
about
missing links etc)
(I'd be VERY glad if you could help me FAST, 'cause this is for my Diplomarbeit
at 
the ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Thank you!)

The problem was that someone thought the \name field in .Rd files gave the
file name: it does not.  This has been fixed for a while, and will
appear fixed in 1.0.0 tomorrow.

You'd have a better chance of getting people to help if you didn't
overload their mailboxes with 3000+ lines of trace output!

I don't know much about the SuSE RPMs, but it would seem that they
expect to find e.g. the FAQ in info format and it isn't there. If
you're in a hurry, I suggest you build from sources.

The part of the install script that fails is not important:
test -d /usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1 && \
  ln -sf /usr/local/lib/R/doc /usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1/R-docs

(/usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1 does not exist but
 /usr/doc/packages/R-base does)

I should remove it from the postinstall script anyway, sorry.

But R should already run on your machine. Does your PATH variable contain
/usr/local/bin ? What happens if you start /usr/local/bin/R ?  I guess you
tried to run /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R directly. This fails because it
contains the path where this R rpm was built. I will clean up this in
future rpms (allready done in R-base-0.99.1a-1.rpm for SuSE 6.3) but if
you use /usr/local/bin/R everything should work, also in this SuSE 6.2
rpm.

I checked the installation with R-base-0.90.1-2.i386.rpm from

   ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pubR/bin/linux/suse/6.2/RPMS/i386/base

on a SuSE 6.2 machine just now, complaint about "execution of script
failed" occurs, but R runs.

BTW, you should consider waiting for version 1.0.0 which arrives soon
(give me also a little bit time to recompile all the rpm packages then)



Best whishes 

Albrecht

etc/colors.big doesn't do the job currently, as:

  colors.big maps 455 names to rgb in S syntax
  rgb.txt maps 657 names to rgb in C syntax, but unlike colors() it has
mixed upper and lower case

The C source has the information twice
  rgb.c maps 657 names to rgb (mixed upper and lower case)
  graphics.c maps 657 names tp colorstrings (lower case only)

internal name2col() and R colors() accesses those in graphics.c

I tend to create a R representation which copies the info from graphics.c,
unless someone plans to export
internal name2col() to become an official R function, which of course would
be a less redundant solution.

There seems to be a problem in 0.99.0a with the normal kind being reset:

Message-ID: <x2aekl6xhr.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


In order not to have more items in the BUGS list than necessary, I've
gone through the list of open bugs and removed some of them for
reasons given below:

(Note that nothing really dies on R-bugs it just moves into trashcan,
wishlist, or Something-fixed, so if you complain loudly enough they
can be picked up again.)

*Graphics*

Remove three reports on panel.first() (2 + 1 answer with a different
number) because one really cannot expect to do what they were trying
to do. We may still want to use eval(panel.first) in plot.default,
though. 

*Low-level*

Jens O-A's:
"as.matrix.data.frame() modifies content of character columns"

was moved to Documentation-fixed. The behaviour is Splus compatible,
so hardly fixable.

*System-specific*

SuSE RPM (non-)issue got cleared up by Albrecht earlier today, I
believe. -->trashcan

*TooMuchAtOnce*

Two very old reports by Jim Lindsey and Rashid Nassar --> trashcan
(because, as the title implies, they are very long and most of the
items have been fixed or gone out of date). Please resubmit (in
smaller pieces!) if you still think there are bugs.

Peter,

> so hardly fixable.

this is shocking bad news, as it means, that we stay with a severe bug, be
it in S+ or not.
It means, we can't be shure, that the CONTENT of a character data remains
unchanged, if we rearange the data.

x1 <- '"'
x2 <- data.frame(I(x1))
x3 <- as.matrix(x2)

> x1
[1] "\""
> x2[1,1]
[1] "\""
> x3[1,1]
[1] "\\\""


I came across this, when I tried to write a function, which exports R data
reliably to flatfiles. Of course I used as.matrix.data.frame as it is a
basic function, but

IF this bug remains in R, there can just be one consequence: NEVER use
as.matrix, at least with character data AND REMEMBER not to use it.

Very unhappy about this

- sorry the previous mail went out by accidentaly hitting a key, here is the
end -

.. please rethink, if there is any way to get that fixed. I mean, do we
really have to expect S+ code to break, because it relies on this bug?

  [ Sent to R-devel instead of R-help ]

  I wrote the following hacks recently, which might be useful to those on
a Unix system (with tr, sed, uniq, and the color list living in
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt): I think that along with palette(), rgb() this
provides most of the functionality for translating among

color numbers
color names
rgb vectors
colors as specified by topo.color() etc. (hex strings)

(I didn't write an rgb vector -> color name translator, would be easy but
seems less useful than the other translations.) Of course, it would be
nice to see these built in instead of hacked.  They could probably even be
hacked better.

system("tr A-Z a-z </usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt | sed -e 's/\\([a-zA-Z]\\) \\([a-zA-Z]\\)/\\1\\2/g' | uniq >colors.tmp")
color.list <- read.table("colors.tmp",skip=1,as.is=TRUE)
names(color.list) <- c("red","green","blue","name")

colorname.to.rgb <- function(name) {
  color.list[pmatch(name,color.list[,"name"]),1:3]
}
  
color.to.rgb <- function(color) {
#  given color as hexadecimal, return RGB values
  hexvec <- c(0:9,"A","B","C","D","E","F")
  rgb <- numeric(3)
  names(rgb) <- c("red","blue","green")
  for (i in (0:2)) {
    h1 <- which(hexvec==substr(color,i*2+2,i*2+2))-1
    h2 <- which(hexvec==substr(color,i*2+3,i*2+3))-1
    rgb[i+1] <- h1*16+h2
  }
  rgb
}

Subject: Feature request for read.table
Date: Mon, 28 Feb 2000 21:43:02 -0500 (EST)

I've discovered Ripley's relevel function, but I'm still wondering
what people might think of the idea of rewriting read.table to have a
data.order argument that would order the levels of factors according
to the order that they appear in the data file.  Thus if data.order
was TRUE and if "Yes" appeared before "No" in a particular column of
the data file, then levels() would return "Yes" "No" for the
corresponding factor, instead of the default alphabetical "No" "Yes".

Note that the flavor of what I want is similar to the functionality of
relevel, and in particular I do not want to make the factors into
ordered factors.

I have put together a quick and dirty function to do this (ignoring
what might happen with NA's), but it seems to me that it might be a
nice option for read.table so I thought I'd suggest it.

This is still in 1.0.0;
I will fix it for the next "patch release".

Thank you for your kind words, but Linux binaries are actually made by
people outside the core team. Albrecht Gebhardt does the SuSE ones,
but I wouldn't know whether he intends to make a version for 6.2
(0.99.0a was 6.3 only).

There isn't. There probably should be.

Hi.

I want to report a bug in read.table.  The attached output demonstrates
the bug.  Unfortunately, the data file contains confidential information
and hence cannot be attached.  Is there any way to figure out the cause 
of the bug and fix it?  Thanks.

Here's the output in readable form. The bug seems to be that
count.fields() thinks the records are the same length but read.table
doesn't.

Ok. read.table and count.fields don't have identical defaults.

R> args(count.fields)
function (file, sep = "", quote = "", skip = 0)

R> args(read.table)
function (file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'", dec = ".",
    row.names, col.names, as.is = FALSE, na.strings = "NA", skip = 0)


So if count.fields likes your data but read.table doesn't, you probably
want

 read.table("Consult/krasdata",sep="\t",quote="")


Please don't use Base64 encoding in attached files -- it was quite hard to
find a program to decode it, and it's really intended for sending binary
files.  Use plain text, and if your mailer insists on encoding attachments
then just cut and paste the output into the message.

read.data and count.fields have different defaults for the quote=
argument (which is arguably a bug). Try read.table(...,quote="") if
the data contain quote marks (single or double).

Subject: [Rd] Segmentation fault in recursion, 0.90.1 (PR#409)
Message-ID: <200002011212.NAA12287@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following gives an immediate segmentation fault, v 0.90.1

"fred" <- function(x) { print(x); Recall(x-1)}
fred(0)	# segmentation fault at recursion 831

Obviously this recursion is non-terminating, but shouldn't it be caught
and reported at some limit?  In 0.64.1 we had

Error: protect(): stack overflow

at recursion 831.  Cheers, Jonathan.

The development version has

Error in print(x) : evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?

Your wish is our command: the development version already gives:

[1] -163
Error in print(x) : evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?

The limit is set by options(expressions=), which at last actually does
something.

As the INSTALL file says, use GNU make?

The current INSTALL script calls ./configure if it exists when
installing packages, but does not check the return value from
configure.  I have my configure script abort under certain conditions
and it would be nice if the INSTALL script would stop at that point.

Also, is there an autoconf macro for testing for gnu make?

Subject: [Rd] Bugs and comments. (PR#410)
Message-ID: <200002021241.NAA25298@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi,
Here are a few errors I found as well as a few comments.

1) In the man page of par:
          lty: The line type.  Line types can either be specified
               as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid, 2=dashed, 3=dot-
               ted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one
               of the character strings `"blank"', `"solid"',
               `"dashed"', `"dotted"' `"dotdash"', `"longdash"',
               or `"twodash"', where `"blank"' uses `invisible
               lines' (i.e. doesn't draw them).

               Alternatively, a string of up to 8 characters
               (from code{c(0:9, "A":"F")}) may be given, giving
  -------------------^^^^^---------------^
               the length (typically in points/pixels) of line
               segments which are alternatively drawn and
               skipped.  For example, `"44"' is dashed and `"13"'
               is dotted.

2) I was trying to get the warnings to look as they use to do but even
  setting the option warn to 1 does not work. For example what kind is
  generating the following warning when a library is loaded???

  > options(warn=1)
  > library(eda)
  Warning: Explicit local dynamic loading not supported on this platform. Using default.
  > 

  Problem can also occurs with error messages:

  > a <- function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z)
      stop("This is an very long error message which will be difficult to see especially in a Microsoft windows version of R.")
  > a(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26)
  Error in a(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,  : This is an very long error message which will be difficult to see especially in a Microsoft windows version of R.

  Basically, in Microsoft windows you can only see about as much as "...  : This$"
  and then the rest is of the screen. As their is no horizontal scroll
  bar... the students are unable to see the error message!

  I personally, prefer warnings to be printed out as they occur, that way
  I can see what is going on. By storing the warnings in a an object rather
  than printing them out if there were more than 10 seems to me as the
  opposite thing to do. Indeed, if lost of warnings occurred it means that
  there is more than certainly a problem. This seems to be getting like SAS
  where people will soon just run something get a result and not even notice
  that a model has not converged (if there were 9 warnings of NA/Inf replaced
  by maximum value and then the no convergence message... they will all be
  stored and the user will not even noticed that the model has not even
  converged!!). This is especially annoying when teaching with students as
  you can imagine.

  As well, I personally think that too much is printed out about the
  function which generated the error. I think that its name is enough
  and that its arguments are of no relevance to where the error
  occurred and just make things harder to read.

3) I got the following error message from the plot function. 

  Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : x and y lengths differ

  Now how is this possible as the arguments of xy.coord are the following??

  > args(xy.coords)
  function (x, y, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, log = NULL, recycle = FALSE) 
  NULL

  As well if you do:

  >  xy.coords(x=response,y=time,xlabel="time",ylabel="weight")
  Error in xy.coords(x = response, y = time, xlabel = "time", ylabel = "weight") : unused argument to function

  It is pretty hard to figure out what argument is unused... it might
  be a good idea to print out which argument was not found.

Patrick.

Um. That's a way not to get a valid covariance matrix and hence no
valid PCA.

as in

princomp(x, data = NULL, covlist = NULL, weights = NULL, scores = T, cor = F, 
        na.action, subset)
?

It really is easy.  If there were not a feature freeze on I would do
it right now.

Good idea.  I'll try to have something like this in after 0.99.0 is out
(currently in feature freeze).

> Also, is there an autoconf macro for testing for gnu make?

No macro, and I would have my doubts whether you'd really want to test
for that (we've been working very hard not to require GNU make for
building R).  But you could simply do

	moutput=`make -v 2>&1 | grep GNU`
	if test -n "${moutput}"; then
	  GMAKE=yes
	else
	  GMAKE=no
	fi

Subject: constrained optimiser doesn't obey constraints


 The constrained optimiser is calling the function with parameter values
outside the constrained range

 In this example the box is from c(0,0,0,0) to c(1,1,.5,1). The function
prints out  the parameter vector when it is out of range. This gives:

[1] "x= -0.001" "x= 1"      "x= 0"      "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"     "x= 1.001" "x= 0"     "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"      "x= 1"      "x= -0.001" "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"     "x= 1"     "x= 0"     "x= 1.001"
[1] "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN"

It seems to be happening in the numerical gradient computation. If the
current parameter value is on the boundary then one or other of the points
used for the finite difference will be over the boundary.

This explains why the values are over the boundary by a consistent small
amount.

Your example seems not valid R (it gives me syntax errors, and with the use
of _ with no space around is completely unreadable to me: I suspect some
lines got split in the wrong place), so I can't run it.  However, I think
the problem is that you

1) Are not supplying derivatives
2) Have a non-differentiable function over the space.
3) Started too near the boundary (the finite-difference step is 1e-3,
by default).

and so the finite-difference code is not obeying the constraints.
Really you need either to supply derivatives or have a differentiable
function over a region a little larger than the constraints.

It should be possible to write the finite-difference code only to 
step into the region: do you want to do it?

Subject: [Rd] anomalies with call objects (PR#412)
Message-ID: <200002060016.BAA26878@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

..but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Thanks, I've had a play with some of these and they look good.
A very minor bug report is that the help for contour says that the
source is in `$RHOME/src/main/plot.c' but it is actually in
`$RHOME/src/main/plot3d.c' (might as well be fixed until someone
makes real documentation). One other thing is that the contour()
command will only draw contours where the x and y dimensions match.
I went through the code and found the check that generates the error
but there is no comment to explain why the check was put in there
but it could be a simple thing to extend it to rectangular grids.

Forget what I said before, rectangular data works fine with contours, just need
to get the x and y ordering correct firstly.

> z<-matrix(data$z,length(y),length(x))

should be

z<-matrix(data$z,length(x),length(y))

Sorry to bother you folks, I'm still learning this.

I would say that R has good plotting facilities and quite fast too.

The type of *p is char which doesn't match the %s specification,
either use %c with *p or use %s with p for example:

       errorcall( call, "invalid \"log=%c\" specification\n", *p );

Hope this hasn't been fixed already, I installed the SRPM from RedHat
so everyone else is probably ahead of me. When I use the correct log="xy"
parameter for the plot function, logarithmic plotting is working correctly.
Yes I admit that I found the documentation for plot.default after I tried
a bunch of other things and traced through the code. There is nothing wrong
with your documentation, it's just me.

This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string

thanks, but this has been fixed :)

0.64.2 is pretty old now;  the latest version (0.99.0) has lots more in it,
including changes to the contour() and persp() functions you asked about in
a previous email.

You also mentioned the GNU libplot library;  0.99.0 has some vector font
stuff from the GNU libplot library in it, but none of the device-driver
stuff.

I am working on an interface between R and the GRASS geographical information
system,
written in R, with no dynamically loaded code. I have written full examples, and
tested
then under R 0.90.1, both by entering example() for each function and R CMD
check, both
of which worked without problem.

Under 0.99.0 however, R CMD check gives a segmentation fault, but running the
examples by hand (X11 not PostScript output) doesn't: 

Core was generated by `/usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.X11 --vanilla'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

The examples do use MASS, spatial, akima, and modreg, and the first three of
these
have been REMOVEd and freshly INSTALLed, just in case, but the problem appears
to
be in the postscript output. If you might find it useful to see the code, I
could
make it available, but I don't think that you really need (!) to install GRASS,
unless
you know definitely that you do!

Hmm. This looks a bit nasty. You're hitting a segmentation fault
inside of an fprintf call, which likely means either that you're badly
out of memory (not really likely) or that the FILE structure "stream"
(alias "s" alis "fp" at 0x726b2e78) has gotten corrupted.

If you run the same example under the debugger, you might go in and
see what got corrupted (run till crash then "up", "up", "p *fp" to get
started) and see at what point in the execution it happened (this is
what gdb's hardware watchpoints are for...).

Subject: [Rd] graphics bugs: steep slopes and large values beyond ylim (PR#414)
Message-ID: <200002072332.AAA13284@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  Some of my students have uncovered some apparent graphics bugs in 
R.  I think they may manifest slightly different on different platforms/
with different display devices (they sometimes report a Windows graph
that looks OK but odd results on printing).
  I'm able to replicate similar problems on my Linux (RH 6.0) system.


1. abline() plots nothing, or a wrong line, when the slope is too steep.

plot(0:10,0:10)
abline(a=0,b=100)
abline(a=0,b=200)
abline(a=0,b=300)
abline(a=0,b=80)

2. when plotting with type "l" and with values far beyond the limits of
the plot, semi-random lines appear on the plot.

plot(exp(1:100),ylim=c(0,10),type="l")

Any thoughts?  I poked a little bit at this myself: abline calls GLine, neither of them
seems to do much checking whether the endpoints of the line to be drawn are way outside of the
window (I guess that XDrawLine, which gets called by GLine, can't handle this).
I guess this should probably be fixed at the the level of GLine (it might fix both of
the above problems, but I'm a little bit afraid digging this deeply into the graphics drivers.
  Maybe it will be obvious to someone closer to the code?

Subject: [Rd] Segmentation fault, devPS.c, 0.99.0 (PR#413)
Message-ID: <200002080025.TAA10262@jessie.research.bell-labs.com>



Just as remote possibility, but a potentially impossible bug source,
Signal 11 errors are often associated with hardware (commonly memory)
errors. Is that in any way a reasonable explanation?

(There are some interesting web pages if you search for signal 11
segmentation.)

Subject: [Rd] fix() changes character to factor (PR#415)
Message-ID: <200002080948.KAA16514@pubhealth.ku.dk>


If x is a data.frame containing a column of mode character, this
column is changed to a factor after applying fix(x).
Example:

R> x_data.frame(a=1:3,b=letters[1:3],c=c("hansi","pepi","karli"))
R> x$c_as.character(x$c)
R> is.character(x$c)
[1] TRUE
R> is.factor(x$c)
[1] FALSE
R> fix(x)
## I change "karli" to "sepp"
R> x$c
[1] hansi pepi  sepp 
Levels:  hansi pepi sepp 
R>  is.character(x$c)
[1] FALSE
R> is.factor(x$c)
[1] TRUE

Now, it is not possible to apply fix(x) again to undo your change,
because edit does not allow to introduce new factor levels.

Thank you for the report, and apologies for the inconvenience.

On some platforms, va_list may be a struct, it appears.

configure stops when checking if cc and f77 "agree on int and double".
This is only due to a linking problem (linking fortran object with cc without
for_main.o complains about unreloved dependency to main.

Solution: add -expect_unresolved main to th linking step, see patch below

1) That is not the way to do that
2) The right way doesn't work either...

Character vectors in data frames will get converted to factors when
you least expect so, unless you protect them with the AsIs class,
i.e.  

x <- data.frame(a=1:3,b=letters[1:3],c=I(c("hansi","pepi","karli")))

Unfortunately, that will not work because is.vector is FALSE on x$c

The following fix to edit.data.frame seems to make things work:

    Is.vector <- function(x)is.vector(unclass(x))
    if (!all(sapply(name, Is.vector) | sapply(name, is.factor))) 
        stop("Can only handle vector and factor elements")

Anyone have a better idea?

(Of course the whole thing needs a redesign...)

Im not sure if this is really correct, but it has proven to work.

1. It is always a good idea to add -std1 to DEC cc's flags to force 
strict ANSI language mode. It was neccessary for 0.90.x to compile, 
so I used it for 0.99.0 too
2. I'm not sure if -fpe3 is neccessary for DEC f77, but it seems to 
enable IEEE floating point exception handling (if I understood what 
was said in the manpage). Correct me if I'm wrong.  

Patch below.

Both DEC cc and gcc complain (osf4.0, alpha) about applying
an unary operator (!) to a non scalar type (va_list arg) in 
printutils.c

I'm not sure if I understood what was intended by "!arg" (see below),
but with this patch I at least was able to compile. (and R runs now,
but I guess only because I didn't came across this code section)

Not going to work, "if (0)" will (i.e. always take else branch).

And please check for similar reports before filing a new one, we
discussed this at some length earlier today!

The problem is that you can't call va_list from another function reliably on
all platforms. It has to be treated very specially (in this case on Alpha it
breaks).

Just replace the if(!arg) with if(0) and dump the special case.

Message-ID: <200002081129.MAA18950@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When I attempt to install the online help for R.99 on Intel RH5.2, I
get the following message

Substitution loop at /usr/local/src/R/etc/Rdconvlib.pl line 1589, <rdfile> chunk 171

and it stops after a few files. Each time I rerun it, it gets a bit
further and gives a different number at the end. I commented out the
line 1589 and it works.

Message-ID: <200002081158.MAA19367@pubhealth.ku.dk>

In R.99, when you strsplit with a space (split=" ") as separator and
the string contains two consecutive spaces, "" is returned.

strsplit("  "," ")
returns
[[1]]
[1] "" ""
whereas it used to return character(0)
  Is this really useful like this?? It certainly messes all my code up. Jim

This appears to be a bug in the Perl included with RH5.2.  Adrian
Trapletti (and Fritz Leisch) reports:

   I had exactly the same problem, also under RH5.2. I upgraded to 
   perl version 5.005_03 and now it works. 

Perl 5.005_02 works for me on Solaris, too.

[I am just filing Adrian's report on R-bugs for the record.]

Compiling R 0.99.0 and GRASS 5.0beta5 on a different machine, also under
RH 6.1, and running the R CMD check for the package, showed that your
intuition was correct. I'm not quite sure, since I repeated the fault
several times on my home machine with more and fewer programs running, and
it always failed at the same point, so I'll still run CMD check through
gdb. I guess it's a hardware matter, though I haven't seen any other
behaviour in my home machine that seemed odd (not really, but I tend to
think it's me that's odd, not the machine!)

I'll pass on the results of gdb later.

Thanks for your help.

Duncan:

I'll check the site you referred to.

On the machine with problems, powering down and restarting, then running R
-d gdb, run --vanilla < GRASS-Ex.R - as Peter suggested, led to the same
sig11, which makes me feel that maybe it's not just memory, because R is
certainly loaded somewhere else in physical space with no GUI running, and
nothing coming from cache. If it's any help, a rerun with the GUI up to
copy & paste output gives:

(including the function where the problem occurs). The (FILE *) looks
healthy enough to me, so I'll accept that the problem is a machine
idiosyncracy. I'll work out a way for the examples to "know" if they are
being run from GRASS-Ex.R, and if so, drop most of the graphic output,
leaving it in for regular example() execution.

Thanks for useful advice,

Roger

I wouldn't think so! 0x20203665 looks suspiciously like a bit of a text
string. "e6  " to be precise (give or take byte ordering issues). And
the pointer is not pointing anywhere useful. I think something is
walking over  pd->psfp

Next step would be to find out where that happens. If you set a
breakpoint in PS_Open just after the R_fopen call, run to it and then
do a 

p &(pd->psfp)
watch *<address obtained from the above>
disp/x *<address obtained from the above>
run

and see if it stops with the memory location being overwritten

It is useful like that. It messed up some other people's code, too (eg
mine), but with the previous behaviour there was no way to distinguish
single and double separators. You can now do

	a<-strsplit(vector.of.strings," ")
	b<-lapply(a,function(x) x[x!=""])

to get the old behaviour (and lapply() is now internal C code).

Congrats on the new release.  The new package management tools are
great!

A couple of quick comments:

1) it might be nice to add an optional "Autoloads:" field to the
description (the package does not depend on these other packages, but
will autoload them if certain functions are called).

2) on page 3 of the R-exts document, it says to set PKG_* flags in
'Makeconf'; I think this should read 'src/Makevars'  (this paragraph in
general is pretty awkward reading).

3) I prefer PKG_LDFLAGS for the "-L" stuff and PKG_LIBS for the "-l"
statements (currently the docs say to put it all in PKG_LIBS).

4) page 5 of R-exts gives an example of using autoconf to enable/disable
R functions depending on whether or not a library is available;
currently it suggests putting a test in the body of the function that is
executed every time the function is called, even if the external library
exists.  This is confusing flow control with conditional compilation. 
Perhaps the example could be reworked so that the function itself is
defined differently depending on whether or not the external library is
found. (If the library does not exist, the function is defined to return
an error; otherwise define the function normally.)

Cheers,
Tim

Hi,
   I'm running debian - upgraded fully to potato at the start of the
freeze and added latest libgnome-dev before configuring.

   I tried compiling with gnome support with

/usr/local/R/R-0.99.0/configure --with-gnome

and got the following output:

According to dpkg I have:

According to apt-get libglade0 is the newest version, so I'm assuming that
0.11 is > 0.3  and there doesn't seem to be a *glade*dev* or anything, 
or that would have shown up.

Congrats on getting 0.99 out, and on the rapid convergence towards 1.0.
Attached below is the latest email in a very interesting thread about
building GNU Octave with the 'Atlas' (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra
Software) libraries that are drop-in replacements for (parts of) Lapack and
the Blas. Speed increases of up to 10 have been reported for simple matrix
multiplication (this is over Lapack/Blas used by Octave).  You can find the
whole thread at http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/mailing-lists/help-octave/2000/

Subject: Re: ATLAS and octave
Date: Wed, 9 Feb 2000 03:05:13 -0600 (CST)

Here is all I did to build a copy of Octave that uses ATLAS:

  1. build ATLAS

  2. merge all four of the libraries that the ATLAS build creates into
     a single libatlas.a and install it in /some/dir.

  3. relink Octave by running

       make SPECIAL_MATH_LIB=/some/dir/libatlas.a

That seems to be all that is needed.

Would it be possible to modify the ATLAS makefiles to just build a
libatlas.a?  Then Octave could simply have

  AC_CHECK_LIB(atlas, ATL_xerbla)

in the configure script, and set SPECIAL_MATH_LIB accordingly.

Things might get a little more complicated for shared libraries.  Some
systems seem to barf when multiple shared libraries define the same
symbol.  But it would probably be possible to solve that, either by
doing whatever is necesary to tell the dynamic linker not to barf, or
by omitting the duplicate symbols from libcruft.

BTW, I see the following speedup on my system (266MHz Pentium II):

  octave:1> a = rand (1000); b = rand (1000); 
  octave:2> t = cputime (); a * b; cputime () - t

  without ATLAS:  94.4 seconds
  with ATLAS:     10.5 seconds

Wow!

Thanks,

jwe

Note that the Debian Atlas libraries are tuned for a P2-350 with 512
cache; which for us is fine, since our MOSIX cluster is full of them.
It might be less optimal for P3's and P1's, since it's supposed to be
(according to the documentation at the original site, as well as the
Debian docs, last I looked) built on the configuration at hand... 

Nonetheless, it might be a worthwhile thing to explore...

Subject: [Rd] Row subsetting of data frames (PR#425)
Message-ID: <200002091738.SAA09768@pubhealth.ku.dk>

If you want to use row names to take a row subset of a data.frame then
there is a bug when
- One row has a name which is a completion of another row name
- The shorter name comes after the longer one
- You want to retrieve the row with the shorter name

An example:

R> x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames=list(c("abc","ab"), c("cde","cd")))
R> x
    cde cd
abc   1  3
ab    2  4
R> x["ab",]                       #Works OK for matrices
cde  cd 
  2   4 
R> y <- as.data.frame(x)
R> y["ab",]                       #but not for a data frame
    cde cd
abc   1  3

The problem boils down to

>  pmatch("ab", c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = T)
[1] 1

and the code expects 2, which is what S gives.  The description of

duplicates.ok: should duplicate matches be allowed?

     If there are multiple matches the result depends on the value of
     `duplicates.ok'. If this is false multiple matches will result in
     the value of `nomatch' being returned, and if it is true, the
     index of the first matching value will be returned.

is different from S: the argument in S refers to allowing
duplicates in x, so

> pmatch(rep("ab",3), c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = T)
[1] 2 2 2
> pmatch(rep("ab",3), c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = F)
[1]  2  1 NA

A quick fix is in [.data.frame, to give

        if (is.character(i))
            i <- sapply(i, function(x) match(x, rows))

but I think we should make pmatch S-compatible.

Problem solved.
I was using dpkg -l \*glade\* to look for what I wanted instead of 
apt-cache search glade.

I installed the following packages:
libglade-gnome0-dev libgladexml-perl libglade0-dev

and everything worked fine.

See R --help. It is R --gui=GNOME, and that does work (in so far as
GNOME support works) for me.

Hmm. Should probably allow the alternate form in the startup script,
and for debugger as well. Did we really mean to make -g defunct, btw?

Yes, the "=" shouldn't be required (yet) anywhere, I think!

I think Kurt even promised to *NOT* make it defunct
(but still "deprecated").

It says in the NEWS:

    o   Long-named options with arguments such as `--vsize' now use the
        `--name=VALUE' form; the old `--name VALUE' is deprecated.

    o   New command line option `--gui' to specify the graphical user
        interface under Unix.  Currently, possible values are `X11' (the
        (default) and `GNOME', provided that GNOME support is available.
        Command line options \`-g' and `--gnome' are defunct.

which seems clear enough to me.  -gui GNOME never existed to be
deprecated!

Never said it did... However the point is that one gets an odd error
message if we don't catch the --gui argument, and while we're there
we might as well look for a following value.

Another options would be to have the script switch catch '--gui*'
instead of '--gui=*' and just let it barf on the absent binary. (The
sed bit should probably read sed -e 's/[^=]*=*//' then)

I'm no fan of removing short-form options in general. Whoever
disagrees should be forced to type "R --debugger=gdb" every time he
needs to restart during a bug hunt... ;)

                      COMPANY PROFILE

ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL is a leading producer of distribution equipment and one of the 
fastest growing private company of its kind in the Romanian economy.

The company is a specialist focused on distribution, protection and regulation of low voltage energy 
for residential homes, commercial buildings, malls, hotels and industrial facilities.

The line of products

* Switchboards for power distribution, control and automation
* Control panels for industrial processes
* Motor control centers
* Installation for power factor compensation
* Distribution panels and pillars 
* 19" enclosures
* Custom - tailored panels, produced and equipped according to the client` s needs.

The Production plant

Over 2500 m2 production areas, ensure complete execution of the switchboards, from the 
construction of the empties enclosures, continuing with the assembling of the electrical components 
and ending up with the final tests.

Given the fact that the company was customer-oriented from the outset, the flexibility required both 
in terms of design and fabrication could only be achieved by using the latest technologies and 
machinery.   

Loyal to this principle, ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL has launched a high scale investment 
policy, consisting in acquisition of modern machine-tools such as: CNC-machining center, CNC-press 
brake and installations for shielded welding (CO2, Argon) and spot welding, installation for powder 
coating etc.

As an innovative solutions provider, we have invested a lot in research and development and 
successfully launched new products, equipped with state-of-the art components such as: 
programmable controllers, static converters, process computers.
We even offer the planning, implementation, training and support that make everything go smoothly. 

Considerable investments in IT are being made to secure the company's competitive edge and 
growth in the years ahead. 

The components and materials used are of best possible quality, being purchased from renown 
companies from Germany (Siemens, ABB, Moeller), France (Schneider Electric, Akzo Nobel), Italy 
(Ansaldo, Microelletrica Scientifica, Lovatto) and others. Our clients are thus offered a wider choice 
and can obtain the most convenient performance/ cost  ratio.


The quality

The quality, one of the most important aspect of the market economy, was successfully taken care 
of,  by the introduction of the Quality Assurance System acccording to ISO 9001, verified and 
certified by TÜV CERT Germany (Certificate no.041007886).
The company has also been authorized by the Romanian Register of Shipping to execute panels for 
this particular domain of activity.

The people

We have built a world class infrastructure, as well as a successful team that sets the pace for the 
economic growth in the whole region. We also have a strong presence in Romania, our 
representatives cover virtually all the counties of the country.

At ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL you will find the availability of a flexible, dynamic and well 
trained workforce with unequalled expertise and experience; over 200 people work here with one 
objective in mind, to help our customers meet their business and technical needs. 


The market

Results had exceeded expectations because relatively low labour costs and high levels of 
production had enabled us to reach high levels of productivity and cost benefits.

The main clients of the company are:

Ironworks industry 	
* The iron works "Sidex", Galati
* The iron works "Silcotub" Zalau with IPROLAM Bucharest
* The aluminium profiles factory "Alro", Slatina

Concrete plans exist for expansion to other key markets in Europe.

We've maintained continued growth in sales ($8 m last year), built a national leading brand and 
matured from a local start-up to a grown up company  within 8 years. All of which leaves us in great 
shape for the future.

Long term commitment and in-depth know-how. These hallmarks have earned us an unrivalled list of 
awards, and more importantly the trust of our partners in Romania

So, at last a company you can completely trust. Now is the time to profit from us!

Sorry folks,
   This isn't a gnome bug at all.  It has to do with make.

The binary is in RHOME, but /usr/local/bin/R is still the 0.90.0 script

The make failed half way through the install:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/demos'
make[1]: Entering directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/doc'
installing doc ...
/usr/bin/install: `../doc/html/search/index.txt' and
`/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/search/index.txt' are the same file
make[1]: *** [install-html] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/doc'
make: *** [install] Error 1

but because it was in the documentation section, I ignored it.
Dumb - I know. (for your info, /mnt/usr+/slashusr is symlinked to /usr)

This may have happened because I didn't clear out all the make after
failing the first make with gnome.

Dear R developers,

sorry about the empty bug-report that I seem to have filed earlier.
(I wrote it via `bug.report()' from within R using `emacsclient'.  I
wasn't aware that I have to save the file after pressing C-x # and
before sending it.)  Hopefully this time it will work......

I noticed the following problem with the on-line help system:

1) I start an R session and type help.start().  
2) In the web page that appears in my browser (Netscape 4.5) I select
   `Search Engine & Keywords'
3) For some keywords (e.g., htest [Statistics] and optimize
   [Mathematics]) in the Keywords by Section list, I get as result
that "no matches for XXXX have been found" if I select them.  But if I
enter those keywords into the text field that appears at the top of
the page and press return, the commands that are grouped under that
keyword are found.

Also, while playing around with these keywords and trying to figure
out what is going on (but, unfortunately, I don't know Javascript well
enough) I noticed that the new function `optim' has as keywords only
`nonlinear' but not `optimize'.  And again, if I select the keyword
`nonlinear' [Statistcs > Models > Regression > Nonlinear], optim does
not appear on the page of results.  But if I enter `nonlinear' into
the search text field, it appears on the page of results.

Cheers,

        Berwin Turlach

Subject: [Rd] R hangs sometimes and crashes (PR#429)
Message-ID: <200002111054.LAA01706@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Kjetil Kjernsmo
Version: 0.65.1
OS: Digital UNIX 4.0
Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.172)


I have the following R code:

ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

photonsincidenttodetectorbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds,
avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
{
  sc <- ampmean - ampmode
  if(sc <= 0) stop("Mean Amplification must be greater than Mode Amplification")

  ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
  return(sum(rgamma(ncb, ampmean / sc, sc) * rpois(ncb, avgphotonfromcloud)))
}



photonsdetectedbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud,
sensitivity, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(rpois(1, sensitivity * photonsincidenttodetectorbin(binno,
ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode, ampmean, numberofbins, linewidth)))

lensedprofile <- function(ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, sensitivity, ampmode
= 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
  return(apply(cbind(x1 =
-as.integer(numberofbins/2):as.integer(numberofbins/2)), 1, photonsdetectedbin,
ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, sensitivity, ampmode, ampmean, numberofbins,
linewidth))

And I have experienced quite often that in 'photonsdetectedbin', R hangs. That
is, while 
it normally takes a second to get an array with the numbers, I let it run for
550 minutes
on an alphaev6 without anything happening. It seemed that it hanged more
frequently for 
small values of ntotalclouds (<8000), but that may not be the case. Anyway, it
happens 
only occasionally, sometimes a call like 
 plot(lensedprofile(10000,1,0.1, ampmean=3), type='l')
will produce a plot instantly, sometimes it will not....
Just now, R crashed, and that is when I figured I should send a bug report...
ESS said:
Process R segmentation fault at Fri Feb 11 11:40:15 2000
Unfortunately, I haven't got a core dump, I've disabled them, I could enable it
if you'd like.

I hope running lensedprofile a number of times will reproduce the problem, but
you never know,
as I haven't been able to narrow the problem down. I haven't had any problems
with 
photonsincidenttodetectorbin, though.

I haven't found any other relevant bug reports.

Well, good time for a bug report like this as I have re-worked the
search engine yesterday (to allow more flexibility and automatic
creation of keyword lists). I see the problems you describe in the old
version, but fortunately:

Clicking on htest now lists all of ctest together with several other
pages.

optimize also gives a non-empty return (though function optim misses
the keyword, I'll fix that).

optim is listed under nonlinear in the new version.

Thanks a lot for the bug report,

Mmmh, seems as if I really should change my options as I seem to keep
sending off empty bug-reports ;-/ Sorry guys.  Here is the content
that should have been in the last e-mail:

`R CMD check nlme' fails on my machine.  The final output in
nlme-Ex.Rout is:

> library(nlme)
> data(Soybean)
> fm1 <- nlme(weight ~ SSlogis(Time, Asym, xmid, scal), data = Soybean,

Error in nlme.formula(weight ~ SSlogis(Time, Asym, xmid, scal), data = Soybean,  : 
	Maximum number of iterations reached without convergence
Execution halted

I presume that `R CMD check MASS' fails for some similar reason.  The
final output in MASS-Ex.Rout is:

Subject: [Rd] behaviour of bug.report (PR#432)
Message-ID: <200002111209.NAA02992@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

it seems that I am in the mood of filing bug reports.  Partly because
R-1.0 is approaching fast, partly to explain why I have send (yet)
another empty bug report.  

My settings are as follows:
> options()$mailer
[1] "mailx"
> options()$method
NULL
> options()$editor
[1] "emacsclient"

My first attempt to send the last bug-report about "R CMD check
[nlme|MASS" was:

> bug.report(subject="`R CMD check [nlme|MASS]' fails")
Waiting for Emacs...Done
Submit the bug report? y
Sending email ...
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
Sending email failed!
The unsent bug report can be found in file R.bug.report 

Obviously, something didn't like the `'' in the subject line.  Can it
be escaped?

Next I typed:
> bug.report(subject="R CMD check [nlme|MASS] fails")

And emacs asked me if I wanted to revert the buffer of file XXXX from
its latest version.  To this I answered `no' since the R.bug.report
buffer still contained the messages that I wanted to send and a `yes'
answer would have put the bug report template into that buffer.  As
expected, I got into the buffer with the report still there.  Upon
pressing `C-x #' I got back to the R session and was asked whether I
wanted to send the bug report:

Waiting for Emacs...Done
Submit the bug report? y
Sending email ...

To my surprise, I then noticed that the empty template was send and
not the report.  I gues the "real" report was only in the buffer and
never written back to the file R.bug.report.  But I kind of wonder
whether emacs or R is to blame for this problem.......

Cheers,

        Berwin

Subject: [Rd] astonishing memory phenomenon
Message-ID: <000501bf7489$a0811960$a9021aac@joelschlaegel>



I have a question concerning memory.

I understood that R takes a fixed amount of memory at startup (which I can
influence with --vsize --nsize) and that gc() shows the memory still free of
the total memory reserved for R.

However, if I create a long vector of character data, gc() only seem to
reflect the space needed for a vector of pointers to char, the space used
for the character data itself is ... hidden!?

Here the data: I have 6 MB heap, and can do

> x <- rep(1, 350000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61034 250000  4.8
Vcells 350955 786432  6.0
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61036 250000  4.8
Vcells 700956 786432  6.0

which is using about 2.67 MB RAM for double numbers.

Trying for 3.05 MB fails (well, rep() obviously needs twice the memory, x <-
double(700000) works)

> x <- rep(1, 400000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
Error: heap memory (6144 Kb) exhausted [needed 3125 Kb more]
       See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.

Now character data, gc() tells us, that we need half that much RAM as
compared to double numbers.
for empty character WHATEVER SIZE THE CHARACTER DATA HAVE

> x <- rep(paste(rep("0", 0), collapse=""), 700000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61036 250000  4.8
Vcells 350955 786432  6.0
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61039 250000  4.8
Vcells 700958 786432  6.0

> x <- rep(paste(rep("0", 4096), collapse=""), 700000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61033 250000  4.8
Vcells 350441 786432  6.0
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61036 250000  4.8
Vcells 700956 786432  6.0


> x <- rep(paste(rep("0", 8192), collapse=""), 700000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
Error: heap memory (6144 Kb) exhausted [needed 2734 Kb more]
       See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.


Furthermore the last x successfully  created should contain data of size
700000*4096 Bytes corresponding to  700000*4096/1024/1024 = 2734 MB, which
is impossible given the startup memory, impossible given RAM, impossible
given that no swaping occurs, furthermore the OS (WinNT4) never shows any
additional memory eaten up except that taken at startup.

What's going on?

Subject: [Rd] Something strange in "?assign"? (PR#433)
Message-ID: <200002111222.NAA03218@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the assign helpfile (0.90.1) the "assign" function is

function (x, value, pos = -1, envir = sys.frame(sys.parent()),
  inherits = FALSE, immediate = TRUE)

which is not quite the implementation, which is

function (x, value, pos = -1, envir = pos.to.env(pos), inherits = FALSE, 
  immediate = TRUE)

This seems to have the following interesting effect.

"short.fun" <- function() {make(); ls()}
"make" <- function() assign("x", 3, envir = sys.frame(sys.parent()))

short.fun()	# gives an x as I would expect

"make" <- function() assign("x", 3)

short.fun()	# now there's nothing here!

But since I have simply duplicated the default value, according to the
help file, I would expect these two "make" functions to behave
identically.  Is this to be expected, and if not, is this because the
definition of "assign" is slightly different to that in the help file?

Many thanks, Jonathan.

OK, that's a bug, in the documentation.

However, it is not a bug that sys.frame(sys.parent()) gives different
results as a default argument and as a supplied one. One is evaluated
in the function, the other in the caller!

Try changing make() to function() {assign("x", 3);print(ls())}

Subject: [Rd] R CMD check [nlme|MASS] fails (PR#431)

To run CMD check on MASS you need to set R_NSIZE in the environment.
500k should do.  MASS passes here on Solaris, Linux and Windows, if one
is patient enough.  I will point out that information is in the on-line
R complements, page 11.

I have just tried nlme on linux and 0.99.0 and example(nlme.formula)
does fail there in CMD check, eventually.

What MASS does not do is make a PDF manual, and that is mainly due to 
problems with the definitions of what needs to be escaped in the 
.Rd files.  A new version will follow once that is resolved
(which may need 1.0.0).

Um, looks like nlsList is not failing gracefully when memory is exhausted,
presumably because restart is in use.

You only have one character data object, of length 0, 4096, 8192,
and lots of references to it.  You don't need multiple copies of the same
data.

Try this again with a character vector of different strings.

Object sharing, and more generally a copy-if-changed strategy.

The subject is used as argument to the command line option -s of mailx

Thanks for the explanation Brian!

This (definitely clever) behaviour of R makes it more difficult to decide,
HOW to import large amounts of data, if the data type is DATE. Dates could
be imported as CHARACTER or as DOUBLE (chron-objects).

Memory requirements of chron would be approx   n*8 Bytes
Memory requirements of character dates like "01/01/2000" would be n*4 + u*10
Memory requirements of character times like "23:03:20" would be n*4 + u*8
Memory requirements of character date-times like "01/01/2000 23:03:20" would
be n*4 + u*19
where n=no of cases and u=no of unique values

Concerning date-times from

  n*8 < n*4 + u*19

we get

  n/u < 4.75

as a condition for the chron object beeing smaller than a character
representation, thus the answer is: IT DEPENDS.

BTW: Is there any specific reason that currently we cannot have chron
objects as columns of data.frames?

As far as I remember, I did not save the file before pressing `C-x #'.
But then, I also did not change the buffer, so I was not asked whether
I wanted to save the file  after pressing `C-x #'.  That's why I made
sure that I modified the buffer on my next attempt.

I guess the following happened:
1) bug.report created the standard template in the file R.bug.report
   and called emacsclient.
2) emacsclient noticed that the content of the file on the disk
   differed from the content of the R.bug.report buffer and asked me
whether I wanted to revert to the version on the disk.  To this I
stated no.  But the content of the buffer was not saved into the file.
3) I saw the buffer with the text that I wanted to send and entered
   `C-x #'.  Since the buffer hadn't be modified, emacs does not ask
whether you want to save it too the file and just exists.
4) bug.report asks whether you want to mail the bug report and on
   answering `yes' mails the file R.bug.report which is on the disk.
In this case the empty template.

This description kind of convinces me that every part worked as it was
designed to do, it's just that it gave a rather unexpected result....

Cheers,

        Berwin

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10002110817290.953-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


I have done a little bit of poking around at the bug that I reported
earlier (steep slopes and lines from far outside the plot range doing
funny things), and have tracked it down to the fact that, as noted in the
Unix man page, XDrawLine[s] doesn't like coordinates that are outside of
the range of (-32767,32767).

Now the question is, what to do about this?  A quick "fix" (not a fix but
at least an acknowledgement of the problem) would check coordinates in
GLine() and issue a warning instead of trying to draw anything if any of
the coordinates was outside the allowed range (would one have to add a
per-driver piece of information giving the min and max vals?).

I wrote a prototype of some clipping code in R that I could translate to C
and stick into src/unix/devX11.c right before every call to XDrawLine or
XDrawLines.  Before I go to that trouble, though: is there a better way to
do this?  Is there already clipping code lying around somewhere else in R?  
Is there a way to do this generically (perhaps by adding an outer clipping
region to every device at its device-coordinate limits) that would
centralize the code and not require it to be repeated for every
driver/line-drawing call?

 Any thoughts?  I'd really like to get this fixed ...

Hmm.  I got it to pass on my Intel Linux machine.  I'll take another
look.

R CMD check nlme does require a large vsize and nsize and a lot of
patience but I did get

Dear all,

In RW0901 I could

Shall I send a bug report or is this a known problem?

The difference is not in rw0901/rw0990 but in the version of chron
in use.  There is an rw0901 version of chron 2.2-2 too.

That happens for me on Unix.  If there is not already a bug report, send one.

The hanging is happening under the current Rpre1.0.0.  It occurs inside
Rf_pois, called with mu=0.

Version: 0.99.0a
OS: Linux 2.2.13 Slackware 7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (195.7.239.50)


I consistently get a sig11 on one file:

gcc -I. -I../include -I../../src/include -I../../src/include/R_ext 
-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -mieee-fp -g -O2 -c fft.c -o fft.o
gcc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11
make[3]: *** [fft.o] Error 1

However, other files and parts of the tree compile still.  (When I had a sig11
being 
caused by a memory fault, once it sig11'd, it would sig11 again.)   I can even
do a
successful kernel compile.  Just not that one file.  I tried removing the ^L
from the
file with no effect.  I'm stumped and am grabbing the latest devel tarball to
see if
that does the same.

C compilers can do that all by themselves occasionally. Which version
are we talking about? Does it work to change the optimisation level
for the file?

Reducing the optimisation to O1 compiles it, but O3 still does
the sig11.  Thanks.  Problem cured if not explained.

Now that *is* pretty odd because I have

$ gcc -v
Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

(Of course Redhat sometimes fixes bugs before making their RPMs...)

Currently, chron objects are stored as numeric vectors with certain
attributes (such as `origin').  I don't see how you could keep the
attributes ...

If I ever get to it, there may be a future version of chron based on a
struct tm like representation.

And I'd prefer to keep it like that.  As I think I already mentioned,
the naming is patterned after autoconf, which distinguishes

 - Variable: LDFLAGS
     Stripping (`-s') and any other miscellaneous options for the
     linker.

 - Variable: LIBS
     `-l' and `-L' options to pass to the linker.

You mean to have

  if(@HAVE_FOO@) {
     foo <- function(x) { ... }
  }
  else {
     foo <- function(x) { stop("...") }
  }

???

That's obviously more efficient, but (as far as I am concerned) not yet
optimal, as it results in ugly conditional code.  When using autoconf, I
think it is far better to use fragments, roughly along the following
lines.  In configure.in, do

  if test "${HAVEFOO}" = TRUE; then
    foo_frag=R/frag/code-for-foo-T.R
  else
    foo_frag=R/frag/code-for-foo-F.R
  fi
  AC_SUBST_FILE(foo_frag)

In one of the .R.in files in the R dir, you can then do

  @foo_frag@

and get configure-time conditional inclusion without any run-time
testing.

(I did not test whether the above works ... can someone please do that?
I will then modify R-exts.texi accordingly.)

The new version of chron (currently, 2.2-2) has added Y2K improvements
as described in file `Y2K' in the chron sources.  Roughly speaking, by
setting options appropriately, it is ensured that two-digit year abbrevs
continue to work ``correctly'' (using a cut-off mechanism to determine
the ``correct'' century).

Note that currently, chron/dates only supports formats like "m/d/y" or
"mdy" where all three signify (2-digit) abbreviations, or non-abbrev
formats such as "day mon year" where now month must be one of "Jan",
"Feb", etc. and corresponding versions with full month names.  A format
like yours, "d/m/Y" in strftime(3) notation, is not supported.

For example,

  as.numeric(dates("1 Jan 2000", format = "day mon year"))
  => 10957

as it should.

David James and I have had some conversation about improving chron.  For
him this is not necessarily high priority, as S-PLUS 5 has adopted their
own timeDate objects.  In R, we can either try implementing that, or
come up with a much improved chron, which would be my preference.  (As I
wrote yesterday, one idea is to use struct tm style representations for
chron objects.)  I will not get to this within the next few weeks
though ...

Meanwhile, it is always possible to write a function which parses the
given format correctly, and pass it on as the `format' argument.

there is clipping code in R (see, e.g,. CScliplines in graphics.c)

whether it gets called or not depends on the canClip flag in the DevDesc
structure.  If this is
false (0) then the R clipping code gets called, otherwise R gets the device
to do the clipping.
currently, the X11 device has canClip = 1 so none of the R clipping code
gets called.

NOTE that getting R to do the clipping serves two purposes:  (i) it clips
(wow !)  (ii) it prevents silly values getting sent to the device

a quick fix then is to simply set canClip = 0 in devX11.c

this is a bit of overkill though because we really only want to do (ii)
above

one solution would be to get R to check for silly values (e.g., clip to devi
ce extent) regardless of the canClip flag, which wouldn't be too much work
because the clipping code is all in place.

i think that would be preferable to making each device responsible for
checking for silly values.

Not to mention that it would break *text* clipping, which R can only
simulate pretty half-heartedly!

Subject: [Rd] More plotting comments
Message-ID: <20000214202323.A12789@ftoomsh.progsoc.uts.edu.au>

None of this is greatly important but might be a bit useful to someone.
BTW, I have 0.99a installed, it compiled without a problem.

I've discovered most of the plotting facilities including the legend()
function and the various text annotations, this is nice an convenient
and flexible enough to do most things. One thing that I must say is that
the help pages on plot() and plot.default() really SHOULD include legend()
in the see-also list because I tried all sorts of things before I found it,
apropos( "key" ), apropos( "note" ), apropos( "annotate" ).

Another tiny thing, is there an official way to put angles or temperature
on a graph? I have been using expression(90^o) for a 90 degree angle which
looks OK but kind of cheats the philosophy of the expression system.
Does anything matter other than how it looks when it prints?

Finally, when I do a plot like this:

	curve( sin, lty="12345678" )

I get a reasonable looking curved line on my X11 window but then I
do the same thing in postscript I get the interesting result that the
dashes are very tiny when viewed in ghostscript (5.10) but sensible
length on paper from the printer. Is this a ghostscript bug or is there
something non-portable about R output files?

An simple example of setting up an eps output for a report might be
helpful because a lot of people will be doing it. Just a suggestion:

ps.options( horizontal=FALSE, onefile=FALSE, paper="special" )
postscript( "/tmp/test.eps", width=4, height=3 )
par( mar=c( 3.5, 3.5, 0, 0 ), ps=10, mgp=c( 2.5, 1, 0 ))
curve( sin, 0, 2 * pi, lty="1494" )
dev.off()

I know it isn't as flashy as some of the existing examples but it does
demonstrate the typical things that you are going to need such as
point sizes, paper sizes, margins, etc. It is also something that can
quickly be grabbed and used by most people.

It looks fine here with ghostscript 6.0.  5.10 is rather old (yes,
I know it is the current GPL version).

I think it is better to set pointsize on the call to postscript().

And possibly confuse them. Not everyone wants to move the labels
around, and in general I think zeroing the margins is a bad idea.
In the technical sense of S graphics you want to include figure regions
not plot regions in other publications.  (In years of doing this
and scores of publications I have only once moved the axis labels.)

Actually, 5.50 is, but you can be excused for not knowing that
(released Feb 13....)

The plot looks OK in 5.50 too.

If your postscript viewer performs antialiasing, small features like
these will smear; try it with antialiasing turned off and see if it
looks more like what you expect.

try ...
    expression(90*degree)

also, for angles, there are ...
    expression(60*minute)
    expression(30*second)

the documentation for mathematical annotation (in 0.99.0) is quite out of
date, but it will be updated for 1.0.0

Subject: [Rd] Error report on empty matrices (PR#435)
Message-ID: <200002142012.VAA28984@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers:

When using R.0.99a (Version 0.99.0 Patched (February 9, 2000), source
compiled with gcc under SuSE 6.2) on a PIII 500Mhz Machine under SuSE
6.2 Linux I found the following bug:

  x <- matrix(0,10,0)    
  rbind(x,2)

causes an R-crash with the message "Gleitkomma-Ausnahme" (floating point
exception) which is probably due to the non-applicability of the
recyling rule.

The same occors when using
  x<-matrix(0,10,0)
  rbind(x,matrix(2,1,1))

The complete log is appended to this note.

In my opinion an error message like

  Error in rbind(...) : number of columns of matrices must match (see
arg 2)   

as it happens with

  x<-matrix(0,10,1)    
  rbind(x,matrix(0,1,0))  

should be given in both erroneous cases. 

Best regards 

      Ulrich Küsters

Subject: [Rd] Problem with expression evaluation depth (PR#436)
Message-ID: <200002142153.WAA29361@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jose M. Perez
Version: 0.99.0a
OS: Linux - 2.0.38
Submission from: (NULL) (159.90.200.68)


Hi,
I'm having problems with the check of
infinite recursion in the expression evaluation 
depth.
The problem appears in a program with no recursions
whatsoever. The layout of my program is a series
of routines called by a big loop.
I printed out depthsave in  src/main/eval.c
and it appears as there is an error popping out
the length of the expression stack, R_EvalDepth,
somewhere. As the loop goes, R_EvalDepth goes up
and down, but in average, it alway increases.

For the moments, I commented out the check with
options$expression and my program finished succesfully.
Any help would be appreciated.

Sounds nasty, but I think we need to have a code sample exhibiting the
behaviour in order to investigate it. Could you try shaving your
example down to something smaller which still has the problem?

The second case should have this. The first case should (I think) return
an 11x0 matrix and give a recycling warning.

That is, rbind(x,2) should append a 2  to all the columns of x.

Subject: [Rd] Autocovariance function (PR#438)
Message-ID: <200002142340.AAA29883@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I am reporting some problems with the autocovariance
function (acf) with the following facts:

First I defined a time series, x, which is a vector
created by x <- ts(rnorm(200)).  Then I plugged the
series directly into the acf function, acf(x) and an
error message popped up as:

Error in .C("acf", as.double(x), s.integer(sampleT),
as.integer(nser),  : C/Fortran function name not
in load table.

I did the library ts but the problem still persists.

That's exactly what I was looking for!

Exactly right, I'm using `gs' and turning off antialiasing fixes it.
I'm surprised at how different the line looks with antialiasing on and off,
I didn't realise the filter was quite so intense.

I guess there is something I'm not understanding here. If I draw a diagram
in xfig and export to eps then it exports exactly that diagram, trimmed
right to the edges of whatever lines are in that picture. Then I import
it into Latex which takes the bounding box and presumes everything in that
box is picture. Latex then adds a little space before and after the picture,
and centres the picture in the column of text. I add the caption under the
figure at the Latex stage rather than have it built into the figure because
that provides automatic figure numbering, font consistency, indexing,
references in the text, etc.

So from R, I expected to get a plot (as an eps file) which is trimmed right
back to the edges of the plot, then I can drop it into Latex exactly the
same as my xfig diagrams, put a caption on them the same way and get the
same spacing as other figures in the report. In addition, giving Latex
responsibility for the margins means that you get the rubbery glue that
juggles items to fit the page evenly.

I can perfectly understand that there are situations where users won't
want to use Latex, they might want to print a whole page of plots without
wanting to include it in a document or they might want to include it in
a different document processor (maybe something WYSIWYG where margins in
the plot are helpful). Formatting styles change in different disciplines,
for whatever reason Engineers tend to pack things in tightly. Anyhow,
I'm just providing some feedback from my own perspective.

And you will see the centring looks wrong, as the `box' is not centred but
the box plus text on the left only. Professionals tell me this is a common
mistake by LaTeX users.  (Actually, LaTeX does not add any space
before or after the picture, although your macro package might, and the
`center' environment does. The standard graphics inclusion mechanism,
graphicx, builds a TeX box exactly enclosing the bounding box.)

There is too little information here: please use bug.report() to submit bug
reports, and give the exact code you used so we can try exactly the same
thing. A good quick test is to run

library(ts)
example(acf)

However,

library(ts)
x <- ts(rnorm(200))
acf(x)

also works on all my (0.90.1 from a later message) systems, so I suggest
you re-build and re-install R, and run make check as that will run the acf
examples.

I'm experiencing problems with rpois. Occasionally, it draws a very high
number.
Yeah, I know, this is statistics, things like that does happen, but this really

strange because a poisson distribution with a parameter of 3 shouldn't see the 
number 1932 very often, but the same, incredibly high number is drawn
repeatedly.

These are the two relevant functions, the latter somewhat expanded for debugging
purposes.

ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

photonsincidenttodetectorbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds,
avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
{
  sc <- ampmean - ampmode
  if(sc <= 0) stop("Mean Amplification must be greater than Mode Amplification")

  ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
  rg <- rgamma(ncb, ampmean / sc, sc)
  rp <- rpois(ncb, avgphotonfromcloud)
  dr <- rg * rp
  if(sum(dr) > 25000) print(cbind(rg, rp, dr, avgphotonfromcloud, ncb))
  return(sum(dr))
}

The if-line is included to trigger unusual events, and I just had output like
this:
 [683,] 2.09611150 1932 4.049687e+03    3 1682.063

 [699,] 0.81551877 1932 1.575582e+03    3 1682.063

Actually, it seems like this large number may dependent of the session one is
in. 
I get 1932 on an XP1000 with an 500MHz alphaev6, but on my own computer, which
is an PWS500au with
an 500MHz alphaev56, I have seen the number 11344 repeatedly. It could of course
be the 
seed or something, I guess.

I can't seem to generate anything unusual with the latest R snapshot.
Perhaps it would help if you told us what parameters to call
photonsincidenttodetectorbin with?

Yep, it's old.... When v1.0.0 comes, I guess I'll get the UNIX people to
install it.

It is really strange, this. I can do

Whoops, sorry, I use 
x <- cbind(-50:50)
apply(x, 1, photonsincidenttodetectorbin, 100000, 3)

Anyway, coming back from lunch, I was unable to reproduce it with this
call, after trying about 50 times... This call made the problem show up
almost every time half an hour ago. I bet there is someone sitting inside
the computer having a good time right now... :-) However, I was able to
reproduce it once in about 10 trails by calling 
plot(lensedprofile(100000,3,1), type='l')
which is a function defined by the rest of my code, that I have attached. 

Best,

thus I tend to see it as a bug, because it may break old code.

Still, I don't know whether it is approbriate to send a bug report to
r-bugs@lists.r-project.org ?

There's an "Add-Ons" slot in the bug repository. We're not forcing package
managers to actually read it and go fix their bugs, though...

I can't reproduce this with either of my pre1.0.0 versions, but I can
reproduce it with a 13/10/99 0.90devel version (ie, just a few weeks
past 0.65.1)

It looks as if the bug has been stomped since then. I can't see how,
though.  Looking at cvs diff I don't see any changes in the logic between
then and the mu<=0 fix a few days ago.

I spoke too soon -- There is an operating system or hardware issue
involved

Today's pre1.0.0 reproduces Kjetil's bug on Solaris 2.7 with
 f77: WorkShop Compilers 5.0 98/12/15 FORTRAN 77 5.0
and
 gcc 2.95.2
On the same machine, but (I think) with earlier versions of both compilers
the bug also happens using a 13 Sept R-devel snapshot.

The bug does not happen with today's pre1.0.0 on Debian Linux
2.2.13-mosix, gcc 2.95.2,  GNU Fortran 0.5.25 19991030 

The fact that the _same_ large number is returned suggests some sort of
memory protection problem, though the machine-dependence doesn't.

Subject: [Rd] contour() labels (PR#441)
Message-ID: <200002160351.EAA14085@pubhealth.ku.dk>

R-0.99.0a now plots contour labels from contour(), but the values in
levels seem to be coerced to integer.

Reproduce by:
> set.seed(2)
> contour(matrix(runif(36),nrow=6), labcex=1.2)

and compare with:
> set.seed(2)
> contour(matrix(10*runif(36),nrow=6), labcex=1.2)

The code has (plot3d.c, ca line 718)

		/* Need to send labels in from interpreted R code ? */
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.00f ", zc);

so, yes, it is printed as an integer, and the comment there is right.  
I guess the labels should be format(levels) by default, to ensure that
the use of trailing zeros is consistent, but it should be in R code
so users can override the default precision, say.

Subject: [Rd] rug() extends axes instead of clipping (PR#442)
Message-ID: <200002160937.KAA16786@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

I noticed that rug() may extend the line of the horizontal axis beyond
the left and right vertical axes.  The following snippet illustrates
the problem:

set.seed(2241)
dat <- rnorm(10) 
plot(c(-2,2),c(0,0.5),type="n", xlab="", ylab="")
rug(dat)

The problem seems to be that:
> range(dat)
[1] -2.739635  1.037512

Cheers,

        Berwin

The docs to rle state that it works for vectors whereas it only works
for numerical vectors. Either the docs or the function should be
changed. The latter is easy: change the diff != 0 to a shifted logical
comparison. Jim

Pre-0.65.1 workspaces? I had not envisaged anyone would still have those.

Fix: in GetRNGstate in RNG.c add the second line of

	default:
	    RNG_kind = RNG_DEFAULT; N01_kind = 0;
	    error(".Random.seed[1] is NOT a valid RNG kind (code)");

Thanks for finding the relevant piece of code.  I did look, but wasn't
au fait enough with C or the R way of doing things to spot the relevant
piece.

How about replacing:
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.00f ", zc);
by:
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.9g ", zc);

It seems to do what I want, and not behave any differently from before
for integer contour lines.

Graphics/442 talks about rug() extending the axis when the range of new values
is bigger than the plot.  This also happens if there are NAs in the data:

x <- c(rnorm(10),NA)
hist(x)
rug(x)

will make the x axis extending off the page to the left.  This seems to be a bug
in axis(at=x), which should either ignore missing values or abort.

I know that the use of a ***character*** matrix is not documented for

Thanks for the report: now fixed. rbinom was only checking if p was
unchanged, and not setting up correctly if n changed too.

[Directed back to R-bugs, and please keep it there!]

OK, there are two issues here:

(a) matrix subscripting doesn't work with character type. Plain and
simple. A matrix subscript just get flattened into a character vector
and then used for subscripting. We might want to give an error instead
or simply implement the expected behaviour, but not this close to a
major release, I think. (Splus cant do this either)

(b) There's a bug in string indexing:

  x<-1:2
  x[c("2","2")]<-2
  x

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. <etc>

It seems to happen only when there are repeated indices. The bug is
that the names component of x which is originally empty isn't filled
with "" for the first elements as it usually is but has NULL (0x0)
pointers there.

Will dig deeper...

I think that is the correct behaviour. (What is the expected
behaviour?  It is what I expected.) A k-index (aka matrix or array
subset) is supposed to give the indices of the elements to be
extracted/replaced. I suppose character values could be matched to
dimnames, but that would be a new idea.  We might want to *warn*.

On the other hand, S-PLUS's print routine seems to ignore the added
elements, and R loses the dim attribute.

repeated *new *indices.

The hackery in StringSubscript was copying the wrong string as a name
for duplicate string indices. Fixed.

Right.

As usual when length and dims develops a mismatch... R is saner, I think

So did I but not correctly (had indexnames instead of s). Thanks.

Subject: [Rd] splitstr documentation problem (PR#451)
Message-ID: <200002182127.WAA14595@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Using the patched version of R-0.99.0, I cannot reproduce the following
example from the strsplit  documentation:

(Example)
unlist(strsplit("a.b.c", "."))  
## [1] "" "" "" "" "" 
## Note that `split' is a regexp!  
## If you really want to split on `.', use
unlist(strsplit("a.b.c", "\."))
## [1] "a" "b" "c"

The problem is in the second example; the "\." should be "\\."  

Thanks for the great software.

Matt Wiener

Subject: [Rd] problem with glm (PR#452)
Message-ID: <200002190151.CAA15336@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

(Two suggestions which are in the current snapshot follow. Looks like
what is which header varies a bit.)

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

#define STDC_HEADERS 1

at the top of regex.c.  (I am not convinced that is the cause here.)

Normal, on a platform with xdr.

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

Dear R-helpers,
	with R-0.99a, Linux, Red-Hat 6.1 derivat (Halloween Linux) I have
the following Problem with this code:

graphics.off()
close.screen(all=T)
temp <- matrix(c(0 , 1 , .4 , 1,                   
                 0 , 1 ,  0 ,.4),                  
                 ncol= 4,                          
                 byrow=T )                         
split.screen(temp)
plot(1:100)
screen(2)
plot(1:100)
close.screen(all=T)
dev.print(postscript,"/tmp/xx.ps")


system("gv /tmp/xx.ps &",T)

fails with (gv Version 3.5.8):

I fixed this earlier today (for 1.0.0, as it was in the R-bugs database as
PR# 378).  You need a screen to split!  So for now precede
split.screen(temp) by plot.new() or frame() or explicitly open a graphics
device.

Your example works on the current snapshot.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Message-ID: <38B1AB06.442E5285@bank-banque-canada.ca>

I'm impressed with all the new options for RNG setting (although, I now
have to re-work the way I was doing some of this). Would it be possible
to add  "default" as a legitimate value for kind and normal.kind in
RNGkind and set.seed? This would be used to set things back to R's
default settings (which may change from time to time with new versions).

Yes, added that. We do not intend to change the defaults again, but
someone may discover something wrong with what we have.

Subject: [Rd] reproducing Box-Muller numbers
Message-ID: <38B2D4D9.5B4A0C50@bank-banque-canada.ca>

There seems to be a minor problem with reproducing numbers from rnorm with
Box-Muller. The pattern suggests it might have something to do with the value
that gets dropped when an odd number of numbers is requested. (Details below.)

Also, could "user-supplied" be added as an option for normal.kind in RNGkind.
I'm sure the Box-Muller in R is better than my own attempt, but I would like to
be able to reproduce results I've obtained in the past.

Yes, it is. I wouldn't recommend that generator, but Martin M requested it
(and for .Random.seed to store the normal type).

I'll make a call to set.seed clear the saved value. That's all we intend to
be reproducible, setting the state by set.seed.

Not very easily, and we are in feature freeze for 1.0.0 now, so not before
1.1.0. It would be easy to patch in your own version, but the 
difficulty is to add all the protection needed for user-supplied code.

I'm  not sure what you mean by this. Are you suggesting that setting
.Random.seed directly is not intended to give reproducible results? I presume
not, but if so, then set.seed needs better control over the seed (i.e. vector
seeds).

When are you expecting 1.1.0? I can easily patch the version used by my library,
but for obvious reasons I would prefer not to post a library that does this. A
very large number of my code tests do not work if I cannot reproduce previous
rnorm random numbers.

Users are not expected to set .Random.seed directly, period. set.seed()
sets one of 2^32 separate seeds: why do you need more?

1.1.0 is not yet announced, but the feature freeze for 1.0.0 has been for
several weeks (on developer.r-project.org). I presume the numbers you want
to reproduce were not standard R before?

I've been using the same random numbers since R 0.49, the last time the uniform
RNG was modified. Before that I was using the same numbers since R 0.16. There
was considerable discussion when the change was made in 0.49 and it was agreed
that in future there would be an effort to make the numbers reproducible. I
certainly agree with improvements, but if you mess up reproducibility you are on
a very slippery slope.

My tests set "Wichmann-Hill", and mostly set the seed to c(979,1479,1542), which
I previously
could do with set.seed, but that has changed in 0.99.

>I presume the numbers you want

I'm not sure what you mean by standard R before, but I have been using my own
version of Box-Muller so that I can be sure to be able to work around changes in
rnorm. I can still do that but for obvious reasons I would prefer not to post a
library that takes control of that part of R.

If you use set.seed and then run, there is reproducibility, It is *not*
messed up.  What is not guaranteed is that user manipulation of
.Random.seed will work unless you stick to the previous options.
There is 100% backwards compatibility.

There was no set.seed prior to 0.99.0!  If you set the .Random.seed to
c(0,979,1479,1542), you will get the same results as before, but without
the warning that has been there for a year now that you needed the zero.

So, no change. Anything you could do in 0.63.1 you can do in 0.99.0.
If you want to take advantage of the new facilities, you need to heed the
current documentation.

I presume that I misunderstand something, but if I do not then I think
there is a serious problem for the way many people actually use RNGs
(rather than studying or testing them). To summarize the way I
understand the documentation and what you have said:

1/ Directly setting the .Random.seed is not something that users should
do and will not in the future be guaranteed to put the RNG into a state
that would reproduce a sequence of random numbers. Users should use
set.seed to put the RNG in a known state. (BTW, I was using my syskern
library version of set.seed before, which just set .Random.seed. Sorry
about the confusion.)

2/ set.seed takes only a single integer as an argument, so there is no
guaranteed way to query the state of the RNG at any given time, and then
reset it to that state at a later time.

If this second point is true, then I fear there is a serious problem.

It is guaranteed to reproduce it, but not to be a valid state if it
were never generated.  So replace `known' by `valid'.

Yes, there is an almost guaranteed way, but only if you restore a previous
value of .Random.seed. The problem is that for complicated generators it is
almost impossible to check if the supplied value is a reasonable one,
so we don't.

The exceptions are non-stateless variate generators, and the Box-Muller one
is such and has a warning to that effect, now:

Note:

     `.Random.seed' saves the seed set for the uniform random-number
     generator, at least for the system generators. It does not
     necessarily save the state of other generators, and in particular
     does not save the state of the Box-Muller normal generator. If you
     want to reproduce work later, call `set.seed' rather than set
     `.Random.seed'.

Incidentally, changes to both rpois and rbinom mean that you may get
different numbers of uniforms drawn and hence different results in the
future. That's life, I am afraid.

I thought Box-Muller just transformations uniform numbers? Does its
state just refer to whether an even or odd number of numbers have been
produced, and in the later case keep the last one for using the next
time?

>If you want to reproduce work later, call `set.seed' rather than set
`.Random.seed'.

But then I'm back to the original problem (which fortunately does not
seem to be a problem for the uniform generator): Using B-M for rnorm I
can't query the state at any given time and then reliably reset to that
state?

Yes. So use a more reliable option for norm_rand.

ok.  It seems that reliable here refers to the fact that the implementation does
not allow the state of the Box-Muller generator to be queried. I'm not an expert
on these things. Would you recommend one of the the other normal generators on a
theoretical basis too?

Problem seems to be that mnhyper as defined doesn't like extreme
arguments, and is being called with

 1/.Machine$double.eps

e.g.

> get("mnhyper",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[2]])(1000000000000000)
[1] NaN
> get("mnhyper",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[2]])(100000000000000)
[1] 21

The code looks like this:

    if (ncp == 0) 
        return(lo)
    if (ncp == Inf) 
        return(hi)
    q <- lo:hi
    d <- dhyper(q, m, n, k) * ncp^(0:(hi - lo))

And I suspect that the test should be ncp^(hi-lo)==Inf.

Seems to work:

> fisher.test(matrix(c(1,20,246,6873),2),hybrid=F)

Interesting. I never thought of the normal generator compensating for
deficiencies in the uniform. Thanks.

Paul

P.S. (Still please add "user-supplied" as an optional normal.kind in 1.1 if
possible. I would like to be able to run my old tests without my library taking
over parts of R base.)

Yes, I have it on the list.  (As you may appreciate, 1.0.0 on 29 Feb is
rather higher up!)  Depending how easy it is, it may make 1.0.x.

Subject: [Rd] bug and fix : using panel.first with plot() in do.call() (PR#457)
Message-ID: <200002251419.PAA13937@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following works as expected
        plot(1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
and if
        my.panel<-function() grid(2,2)
then
        plot(1:5, panel.first=my.panel() )
is also OK

but, 
        do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
        do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel)) 
        do.plot("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel() ))
do not draw the grid because the panel.first expression is evaluated
before the plot gets drawn.


A solution is to modify plot.default such that the line

panel.first
is replaced by

if(is.function(panel.first)) {
        panel.first()
}else {
        panel.first
}
This allows the previous behaviour, but also allows a function name to
be passed to plot using do.call()
now all the following produce the expected graph
plot(1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
plot(1:5, panel.first=my.panel())
plot(1:5,panel.first=my.panel)

do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel ))

Similarly the line 

panel.last 
should be replaced by 
if(is.function(panel.last)) {
        panel.last()
} else {
panel.last
}

As far as I am aware this affects all recent versions.
Cheers, Colin.

Yes, and a solution is

         do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=quote(grid(2,2))))

as when you do this sort of thing you can't rely on lazy evaluation.
replacing `quote' by `delay' will also work.  The help page says
they should be unevaluated expressions.

Um, ?plot.default say panel.first and panel.last should be *expressions*
*to be evaluated*, so is this not working as documented?

Um, ?plot.default say panel.first and panel.last should be *expressions*
*to be evaluated*, so is this not working as documented?

Subject: [Rd] lambda==0 in dpois() (PR#459)
Message-ID: <200002251927.UAA16322@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  The nice new log=TRUE option in dpois appears to mess up the
case where lambda=0 (I was trying to calculate the likelihood
of a saturated model).  Because the behavior is now always to
calculate the probability in terms of exp(log(prob)), there's
a test for lambda<=0 which really needs to be only lambda<0.

  dpois(0:5,0)

ought to give

 1 0 0 0 0 

but gives NaNs instead.

  Here's a patch to src/nmath/dpois.c that appears to work (although it could ? be more
elegant).

Thanks. We may just be able to squeeze that one in before 1.0.0. But
shouldn't it return -Inf  (ML_NEGINF) for the log case rather than NaN?

  I think you're right.
  By the way, it looks like qpois() may be subject to a similar problem,
although I haven't dug in.  Don't know about any of the other
distributions (dbinom() looks OK).

But... if I does work if I do the following

dataset$MACDfast <- dataset$ema26 - dataset$ema12
dataset$MACDslow <- EMA(dataset$MACDfast,9)
dataset$MACDhist <- dataset$MACDfast - dataset$MACDslow

Something seems wrong if you have an underscore in the dataname.  I think
this is a valid name and shouldnt need to be escaped inside of "".

No, it's not a valid name. The underscore is a synonym for the assignment
operator <-, and so needs to be quoted if you use it. 

If you think this is horrible you're quite right, but the S language
allows _ for <- and many people are used to it.

The commonest S usage is MACD.fast, though some people use capital letters
for embedded words -- MACDFast. Both are used in the base R package:
as.vector(), getOption().

I just wanted to install the rpm package with rpm --v -i [file], and here is the
log:
(I DID run it as root!!)
(the important thing is in the end: there must be a bug in the post install
script.
The problem is, that it does install all the files, but it doesn't correctly
hang
the whole thing into the system. No binaries can be run, it always says things
about
missing links etc)
(I'd be VERY glad if you could help me FAST, 'cause this is for my Diplomarbeit
at 
the ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Thank you!)

The problem was that someone thought the \name field in .Rd files gave the
file name: it does not.  This has been fixed for a while, and will
appear fixed in 1.0.0 tomorrow.

You'd have a better chance of getting people to help if you didn't
overload their mailboxes with 3000+ lines of trace output!

I don't know much about the SuSE RPMs, but it would seem that they
expect to find e.g. the FAQ in info format and it isn't there. If
you're in a hurry, I suggest you build from sources.

The part of the install script that fails is not important:
test -d /usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1 && \
  ln -sf /usr/local/lib/R/doc /usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1/R-docs

(/usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1 does not exist but
 /usr/doc/packages/R-base does)

I should remove it from the postinstall script anyway, sorry.

But R should already run on your machine. Does your PATH variable contain
/usr/local/bin ? What happens if you start /usr/local/bin/R ?  I guess you
tried to run /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R directly. This fails because it
contains the path where this R rpm was built. I will clean up this in
future rpms (allready done in R-base-0.99.1a-1.rpm for SuSE 6.3) but if
you use /usr/local/bin/R everything should work, also in this SuSE 6.2
rpm.

I checked the installation with R-base-0.90.1-2.i386.rpm from

   ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pubR/bin/linux/suse/6.2/RPMS/i386/base

on a SuSE 6.2 machine just now, complaint about "execution of script
failed" occurs, but R runs.

BTW, you should consider waiting for version 1.0.0 which arrives soon
(give me also a little bit time to recompile all the rpm packages then)



Best whishes 

Albrecht

etc/colors.big doesn't do the job currently, as:

  colors.big maps 455 names to rgb in S syntax
  rgb.txt maps 657 names to rgb in C syntax, but unlike colors() it has
mixed upper and lower case

The C source has the information twice
  rgb.c maps 657 names to rgb (mixed upper and lower case)
  graphics.c maps 657 names tp colorstrings (lower case only)

internal name2col() and R colors() accesses those in graphics.c

I tend to create a R representation which copies the info from graphics.c,
unless someone plans to export
internal name2col() to become an official R function, which of course would
be a less redundant solution.

Jens

There seems to be a problem in 0.99.0a with the normal kind being reset:

Subject: [Rd] Cleaning up in the bugs repository
Message-ID: <x2aekl6xhr.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


In order not to have more items in the BUGS list than necessary, I've
gone through the list of open bugs and removed some of them for
reasons given below:

(Note that nothing really dies on R-bugs it just moves into trashcan,
wishlist, or Something-fixed, so if you complain loudly enough they
can be picked up again.)

*Graphics*

Remove three reports on panel.first() (2 + 1 answer with a different
number) because one really cannot expect to do what they were trying
to do. We may still want to use eval(panel.first) in plot.default,
though. 

*Low-level*

Jens O-A's:
"as.matrix.data.frame() modifies content of character columns"

was moved to Documentation-fixed. The behaviour is Splus compatible,
so hardly fixable.

*System-specific*

SuSE RPM (non-)issue got cleared up by Albrecht earlier today, I
believe. -->trashcan

*TooMuchAtOnce*

Two very old reports by Jim Lindsey and Rashid Nassar --> trashcan
(because, as the title implies, they are very long and most of the
items have been fixed or gone out of date). Please resubmit (in
smaller pieces!) if you still think there are bugs.

Peter,

this is shocking bad news, as it means, that we stay with a severe bug, be
it in S+ or not.
It means, we can't be shure, that the CONTENT of a character data remains
unchanged, if we rearange the data.

x1 <- '"'
x2 <- data.frame(I(x1))
x3 <- as.matrix(x2)

> x1
[1] "\""
> x2[1,1]
[1] "\""
> x3[1,1]
[1] "\\\""


I came across this, when I tried to write a function, which exports R data
reliably to flatfiles. Of course I used as.matrix.data.frame as it is a
basic function, but

IF this bug remains in R, there can just be one consequence: NEVER use
as.matrix, at least with character data AND REMEMBER not to use it.

Very unhappy about this

- sorry the previous mail went out by accidentaly hitting a key, here is the
end -

.. please rethink, if there is any way to get that fixed. I mean, do we
really have to expect S+ code to break, because it relies on this bug?

  [ Sent to R-devel instead of R-help ]

  I wrote the following hacks recently, which might be useful to those on
a Unix system (with tr, sed, uniq, and the color list living in
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt): I think that along with palette(), rgb() this
provides most of the functionality for translating among

color numbers
color names
rgb vectors
colors as specified by topo.color() etc. (hex strings)

(I didn't write an rgb vector -> color name translator, would be easy but
seems less useful than the other translations.) Of course, it would be
nice to see these built in instead of hacked.  They could probably even be
hacked better.

system("tr A-Z a-z </usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt | sed -e 's/\\([a-zA-Z]\\) \\([a-zA-Z]\\)/\\1\\2/g' | uniq >colors.tmp")
color.list <- read.table("colors.tmp",skip=1,as.is=TRUE)
names(color.list) <- c("red","green","blue","name")

colorname.to.rgb <- function(name) {
  color.list[pmatch(name,color.list[,"name"]),1:3]
}
  
color.to.rgb <- function(color) {
#  given color as hexadecimal, return RGB values
  hexvec <- c(0:9,"A","B","C","D","E","F")
  rgb <- numeric(3)
  names(rgb) <- c("red","blue","green")
  for (i in (0:2)) {
    h1 <- which(hexvec==substr(color,i*2+2,i*2+2))-1
    h2 <- which(hexvec==substr(color,i*2+3,i*2+3))-1
    rgb[i+1] <- h1*16+h2
  }
  rgb
}

Subject: Feature request for read.table
Date: Mon, 28 Feb 2000 21:43:02 -0500 (EST)

I've discovered Ripley's relevel function, but I'm still wondering
what people might think of the idea of rewriting read.table to have a
data.order argument that would order the levels of factors according
to the order that they appear in the data file.  Thus if data.order
was TRUE and if "Yes" appeared before "No" in a particular column of
the data file, then levels() would return "Yes" "No" for the
corresponding factor, instead of the default alphabetical "No" "Yes".

Note that the flavor of what I want is similar to the functionality of
relevel, and in particular I do not want to make the factors into
ordered factors.

I have put together a quick and dirty function to do this (ignoring
what might happen with NA's), but it seems to me that it might be a
nice option for read.table so I thought I'd suggest it.

This is still in 1.0.0;
I will fix it for the next "patch release".

Thank you for your kind words, but Linux binaries are actually made by
people outside the core team. Albrecht Gebhardt does the SuSE ones,
but I wouldn't know whether he intends to make a version for 6.2
(0.99.0a was 6.3 only).

There isn't. There probably should be.

Hi.

I want to report a bug in read.table.  The attached output demonstrates
the bug.  Unfortunately, the data file contains confidential information
and hence cannot be attached.  Is there any way to figure out the cause 
of the bug and fix it?  Thanks.

Here's the output in readable form. The bug seems to be that
count.fields() thinks the records are the same length but read.table
doesn't.

Ok. read.table and count.fields don't have identical defaults.

R> args(count.fields)
function (file, sep = "", quote = "", skip = 0)

R> args(read.table)
function (file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'", dec = ".",
    row.names, col.names, as.is = FALSE, na.strings = "NA", skip = 0)


So if count.fields likes your data but read.table doesn't, you probably
want

 read.table("Consult/krasdata",sep="\t",quote="")


Please don't use Base64 encoding in attached files -- it was quite hard to
find a program to decode it, and it's really intended for sending binary
files.  Use plain text, and if your mailer insists on encoding attachments
then just cut and paste the output into the message.

read.data and count.fields have different defaults for the quote=
argument (which is arguably a bug). Try read.table(...,quote="") if
the data contain quote marks (single or double).

Subject: [Rd] Segmentation fault in recursion, 0.90.1 (PR#409)
Message-ID: <200002011212.NAA12287@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following gives an immediate segmentation fault, v 0.90.1

"fred" <- function(x) { print(x); Recall(x-1)}
fred(0)	# segmentation fault at recursion 831

Obviously this recursion is non-terminating, but shouldn't it be caught
and reported at some limit?  In 0.64.1 we had

Error: protect(): stack overflow

at recursion 831.  Cheers, Jonathan.

The development version has

[1] -163
Error in print(x) : evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?

The limit can be set with options(expressions=...)

Your wish is our command: the development version already gives:

[1] -163
Error in print(x) : evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?

The limit is set by options(expressions=), which at last actually does
something.

As the INSTALL file says, use GNU make?

Good point.  Perhaps this could be added to the FAQ #5.2?

Message-ID: <38973225.9B281007@nceas.ucsb.edu>

The current INSTALL script calls ./configure if it exists when
installing packages, but does not check the return value from
configure.  I have my configure script abort under certain conditions
and it would be nice if the INSTALL script would stop at that point.

Also, is there an autoconf macro for testing for gnu make?

Subject: [Rd] Bugs and comments. (PR#410)
Message-ID: <200002021241.NAA25298@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi,
Here are a few errors I found as well as a few comments.

1) In the man page of par:
          lty: The line type.  Line types can either be specified
               as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid, 2=dashed, 3=dot-
               ted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one
               of the character strings `"blank"', `"solid"',
               `"dashed"', `"dotted"' `"dotdash"', `"longdash"',
               or `"twodash"', where `"blank"' uses `invisible
               lines' (i.e. doesn't draw them).

               Alternatively, a string of up to 8 characters
               (from code{c(0:9, "A":"F")}) may be given, giving
  -------------------^^^^^---------------^
               the length (typically in points/pixels) of line
               segments which are alternatively drawn and
               skipped.  For example, `"44"' is dashed and `"13"'
               is dotted.

2) I was trying to get the warnings to look as they use to do but even
  setting the option warn to 1 does not work. For example what kind is
  generating the following warning when a library is loaded???

  > options(warn=1)
  > library(eda)
  Warning: Explicit local dynamic loading not supported on this platform. Using default.
  > 

  Problem can also occurs with error messages:

  > a <- function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z)
      stop("This is an very long error message which will be difficult to see especially in a Microsoft windows version of R.")
  > a(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26)
  Error in a(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,  : This is an very long error message which will be difficult to see especially in a Microsoft windows version of R.

  Basically, in Microsoft windows you can only see about as much as "...  : This$"
  and then the rest is of the screen. As their is no horizontal scroll
  bar... the students are unable to see the error message!

  I personally, prefer warnings to be printed out as they occur, that way
  I can see what is going on. By storing the warnings in a an object rather
  than printing them out if there were more than 10 seems to me as the
  opposite thing to do. Indeed, if lost of warnings occurred it means that
  there is more than certainly a problem. This seems to be getting like SAS
  where people will soon just run something get a result and not even notice
  that a model has not converged (if there were 9 warnings of NA/Inf replaced
  by maximum value and then the no convergence message... they will all be
  stored and the user will not even noticed that the model has not even
  converged!!). This is especially annoying when teaching with students as
  you can imagine.

  As well, I personally think that too much is printed out about the
  function which generated the error. I think that its name is enough
  and that its arguments are of no relevance to where the error
  occurred and just make things harder to read.

3) I got the following error message from the plot function. 

  Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : x and y lengths differ

  Now how is this possible as the arguments of xy.coord are the following??

  > args(xy.coords)
  function (x, y, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, log = NULL, recycle = FALSE) 
  NULL

  As well if you do:

  >  xy.coords(x=response,y=time,xlabel="time",ylabel="weight")
  Error in xy.coords(x = response, y = time, xlabel = "time", ylabel = "weight") : unused argument to function

  It is pretty hard to figure out what argument is unused... it might
  be a good idea to print out which argument was not found.

Patrick.

Um. That's a way not to get a valid covariance matrix and hence no
valid PCA.

as in

princomp(x, data = NULL, covlist = NULL, weights = NULL, scores = T, cor = F, 
        na.action, subset)
?

It really is easy.  If there were not a feature freeze on I would do
it right now.

Good idea.  I'll try to have something like this in after 0.99.0 is out
(currently in feature freeze).

> Also, is there an autoconf macro for testing for gnu make?

No macro, and I would have my doubts whether you'd really want to test
for that (we've been working very hard not to require GNU make for
building R).  But you could simply do

	moutput=`make -v 2>&1 | grep GNU`
	if test -n "${moutput}"; then
	  GMAKE=yes
	else
	  GMAKE=no
	fi

Subject: constrained optimiser doesn't obey constraints


 The constrained optimiser is calling the function with parameter values
outside the constrained range

 In this example the box is from c(0,0,0,0) to c(1,1,.5,1). The function
prints out  the parameter vector when it is out of range. This gives:

[1] "x= -0.001" "x= 1"      "x= 0"      "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"     "x= 1.001" "x= 0"     "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"      "x= 1"      "x= -0.001" "x= 1"
[1] "x= 0"     "x= 1"     "x= 0"     "x= 1.001"
[1] "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN"
[1] "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN" "x= NaN"
 repeated a number of times.

 For these starting value it eventually reports convergence, for
 some others it goes forever.

---Example code---

revise.mix.binbb_function(x,loss,no.inform){
    if (any(is.nan(x)) || any(x<0) || any(x>c(1,1,.5,1))){

It seems to be happening in the numerical gradient computation. If the
current parameter value is on the boundary then one or other of the points
used for the finite difference will be over the boundary.

This explains why the values are over the boundary by a consistent small
amount.

Your example seems not valid R (it gives me syntax errors, and with the use
of _ with no space around is completely unreadable to me: I suspect some
lines got split in the wrong place), so I can't run it.  However, I think
the problem is that you

1) Are not supplying derivatives
2) Have a non-differentiable function over the space.
3) Started too near the boundary (the finite-difference step is 1e-3,
by default).

and so the finite-difference code is not obeying the constraints.
Really you need either to supply derivatives or have a differentiable
function over a region a little larger than the constraints.

It should be possible to write the finite-difference code only to 
step into the region: do you want to do it?

Subject: [Rd] anomalies with call objects (PR#412)
Message-ID: <200002060016.BAA26878@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

..but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Thanks, I've had a play with some of these and they look good.
A very minor bug report is that the help for contour says that the
source is in `$RHOME/src/main/plot.c' but it is actually in
`$RHOME/src/main/plot3d.c' (might as well be fixed until someone
makes real documentation). One other thing is that the contour()
command will only draw contours where the x and y dimensions match.
I went through the code and found the check that generates the error
but there is no comment to explain why the check was put in there
but it could be a simple thing to extend it to rectangular grids.

Forget what I said before, rectangular data works fine with contours, just need
to get the x and y ordering correct firstly.

> z<-matrix(data$z,length(y),length(x))

should be

z<-matrix(data$z,length(x),length(y))

Sorry to bother you folks, I'm still learning this.

I would say that R has good plotting facilities and quite fast too.

The type of *p is char which doesn't match the %s specification,
either use %c with *p or use %s with p for example:

       errorcall( call, "invalid \"log=%c\" specification\n", *p );

Hope this hasn't been fixed already, I installed the SRPM from RedHat
so everyone else is probably ahead of me. When I use the correct log="xy"
parameter for the plot function, logarithmic plotting is working correctly.
Yes I admit that I found the documentation for plot.default after I tried
a bunch of other things and traced through the code. There is nothing wrong
with your documentation, it's just me.

This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

thanks, but this has been fixed :)

0.64.2 is pretty old now;  the latest version (0.99.0) has lots more in it,
including changes to the contour() and persp() functions you asked about in
a previous email.

You also mentioned the GNU libplot library;  0.99.0 has some vector font
stuff from the GNU libplot library in it, but none of the device-driver
stuff.

Submission from: (NULL) (158.37.60.152)


I am working on an interface between R and the GRASS geographical information
system,
written in R, with no dynamically loaded code. I have written full examples, and
tested
then under R 0.90.1, both by entering example() for each function and R CMD
check, both
of which worked without problem.

Under 0.99.0 however, R CMD check gives a segmentation fault, but running the
examples by hand (X11 not PostScript output) doesn't: 

Core was generated by `/usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.X11 --vanilla'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

The examples do use MASS, spatial, akima, and modreg, and the first three of
these
have been REMOVEd and freshly INSTALLed, just in case, but the problem appears
to
be in the postscript output. If you might find it useful to see the code, I
could
make it available, but I don't think that you really need (!) to install GRASS,
unless
you know definitely that you do!

Hmm. This looks a bit nasty. You're hitting a segmentation fault
inside of an fprintf call, which likely means either that you're badly
out of memory (not really likely) or that the FILE structure "stream"
(alias "s" alis "fp" at 0x726b2e78) has gotten corrupted.

If you run the same example under the debugger, you might go in and
see what got corrupted (run till crash then "up", "up", "p *fp" to get
started) and see at what point in the execution it happened (this is
what gdb's hardware watchpoints are for...).

Subject: [Rd] graphics bugs: steep slopes and large values beyond ylim (PR#414)
Message-ID: <200002072332.AAA13284@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  Some of my students have uncovered some apparent graphics bugs in 
R.  I think they may manifest slightly different on different platforms/
with different display devices (they sometimes report a Windows graph
that looks OK but odd results on printing).
  I'm able to replicate similar problems on my Linux (RH 6.0) system.


1. abline() plots nothing, or a wrong line, when the slope is too steep.

plot(0:10,0:10)
abline(a=0,b=100)
abline(a=0,b=200)
abline(a=0,b=300)
abline(a=0,b=80)

2. when plotting with type "l" and with values far beyond the limits of
the plot, semi-random lines appear on the plot.

plot(exp(1:100),ylim=c(0,10),type="l")

Any thoughts?  I poked a little bit at this myself: abline calls GLine, neither of them
seems to do much checking whether the endpoints of the line to be drawn are way outside of the
window (I guess that XDrawLine, which gets called by GLine, can't handle this).
I guess this should probably be fixed at the the level of GLine (it might fix both of
the above problems, but I'm a little bit afraid digging this deeply into the graphics drivers.
  Maybe it will be obvious to someone closer to the code?

Just as remote possibility, but a potentially impossible bug source,
Signal 11 errors are often associated with hardware (commonly memory)
errors. Is that in any way a reasonable explanation?

(There are some interesting web pages if you search for signal 11
segmentation.)

Subject: [Rd] fix() changes character to factor (PR#415)
Message-ID: <200002080948.KAA16514@pubhealth.ku.dk>


If x is a data.frame containing a column of mode character, this
column is changed to a factor after applying fix(x).
Example:

R> x_data.frame(a=1:3,b=letters[1:3],c=c("hansi","pepi","karli"))
R> x$c_as.character(x$c)
R> is.character(x$c)
[1] TRUE
R> is.factor(x$c)
[1] FALSE
R> fix(x)
## I change "karli" to "sepp"
R> x$c
[1] hansi pepi  sepp 
Levels:  hansi pepi sepp 
R>  is.character(x$c)
[1] FALSE
R> is.factor(x$c)
[1] TRUE

Now, it is not possible to apply fix(x) again to undo your change,
because edit does not allow to introduce new factor levels.

Thank you for the report, and apologies for the inconvenience.

Subject: [Rd] configure doesn't accept f77 on alpha (PR#419)
Message-ID: <200002081008.LAA17144@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Albrecht Gebhardt

OS: alpha, osf4.0

configure stops when checking if cc and f77 "agree on int and double".
This is only due to a linking problem (linking fortran object with cc without
for_main.o complains about unreloved dependency to main.

Solution: add -expect_unresolved main to th linking step, see patch below

1) That is not the way to do that
2) The right way doesn't work either...

Character vectors in data frames will get converted to factors when
you least expect so, unless you protect them with the AsIs class,
i.e.  

x <- data.frame(a=1:3,b=letters[1:3],c=I(c("hansi","pepi","karli")))

Unfortunately, that will not work because is.vector is FALSE on x$c

The following fix to edit.data.frame seems to make things work:

    Is.vector <- function(x)is.vector(unclass(x))
    if (!all(sapply(name, Is.vector) | sapply(name, is.factor))) 
        stop("Can only handle vector and factor elements")

Anyone have a better idea?

(Of course the whole thing needs a redesign...)

Im not sure if this is really correct, but it has proven to work.

1. It is always a good idea to add -std1 to DEC cc's flags to force 
strict ANSI language mode. It was neccessary for 0.90.x to compile, 
so I used it for 0.99.0 too
2. I'm not sure if -fpe3 is neccessary for DEC f77, but it seems to 
enable IEEE floating point exception handling (if I understood what 
was said in the manpage). Correct me if I'm wrong.  

Patch below.

Both DEC cc and gcc complain (osf4.0, alpha) about applying
an unary operator (!) to a non scalar type (va_list arg) in 
printutils.c

I'm not sure if I understood what was intended by "!arg" (see below),
but with this patch I at least was able to compile. (and R runs now,
but I guess only because I didn't came across this code section)

Not going to work, "if (0)" will (i.e. always take else branch).

And please check for similar reports before filing a new one, we
discussed this at some length earlier today!

The problem is that you can't call va_list from another function reliably on
all platforms. It has to be treated very specially (in this case on Alpha it
breaks).

Just replace the if(!arg) with if(0) and dump the special case.

Subject: [Rd] installing online help (PR#423)
Message-ID: <200002081129.MAA18950@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When I attempt to install the online help for R.99 on Intel RH5.2, I
get the following message

Substitution loop at /usr/local/src/R/etc/Rdconvlib.pl line 1589, <rdfile> chunk 171

and it stops after a few files. Each time I rerun it, it gets a bit
further and gives a different number at the end. I commented out the
line 1589 and it works.

Message-ID: <200002081158.MAA19367@pubhealth.ku.dk>

In R.99, when you strsplit with a space (split=" ") as separator and
the string contains two consecutive spaces, "" is returned.

strsplit("  "," ")
returns
[[1]]
[1] "" ""
whereas it used to return character(0)
  Is this really useful like this?? It certainly messes all my code up. Jim

This appears to be a bug in the Perl included with RH5.2.  Adrian
Trapletti (and Fritz Leisch) reports:

   I had exactly the same problem, also under RH5.2. I upgraded to 
   perl version 5.005_03 and now it works. 

Perl 5.005_02 works for me on Solaris, too.

[I am just filing Adrian's report on R-bugs for the record.]

Compiling R 0.99.0 and GRASS 5.0beta5 on a different machine, also under
RH 6.1, and running the R CMD check for the package, showed that your
intuition was correct. I'm not quite sure, since I repeated the fault
several times on my home machine with more and fewer programs running, and
it always failed at the same point, so I'll still run CMD check through
gdb. I guess it's a hardware matter, though I haven't seen any other
behaviour in my home machine that seemed odd (not really, but I tend to
think it's me that's odd, not the machine!)

I'll pass on the results of gdb later.

Thanks for your help.

Duncan:

I'll check the site you referred to.

On the machine with problems, powering down and restarting, then running R
-d gdb, run --vanilla < GRASS-Ex.R - as Peter suggested, led to the same
sig11, which makes me feel that maybe it's not just memory, because R is
certainly loaded somewhere else in physical space with no GUI running, and
nothing coming from cache. If it's any help, a rerun with the GUI up to
copy & paste output gives:

(including the function where the problem occurs). The (FILE *) looks
healthy enough to me, so I'll accept that the problem is a machine
idiosyncracy. I'll work out a way for the examples to "know" if they are
being run from GRASS-Ex.R, and if so, drop most of the graphic output,
leaving it in for regular example() execution.

Thanks for useful advice,

I wouldn't think so! 0x20203665 looks suspiciously like a bit of a text
string. "e6  " to be precise (give or take byte ordering issues). And
the pointer is not pointing anywhere useful. I think something is
walking over  pd->psfp

Next step would be to find out where that happens. If you set a
breakpoint in PS_Open just after the R_fopen call, run to it and then
do a 

p &(pd->psfp)
watch *<address obtained from the above>
disp/x *<address obtained from the above>
run

and see if it stops with the memory location being overwritten

It is useful like that. It messed up some other people's code, too (eg
mine), but with the previous behaviour there was no way to distinguish
single and double separators. You can now do

	a<-strsplit(vector.of.strings," ")
	b<-lapply(a,function(x) x[x!=""])

to get the old behaviour (and lapply() is now internal C code).

Message-ID: <38A07AF8.E9A7BFF5@nceas.ucsb.edu>

Congrats on the new release.  The new package management tools are
great!

A couple of quick comments:

1) it might be nice to add an optional "Autoloads:" field to the
description (the package does not depend on these other packages, but
will autoload them if certain functions are called).

2) on page 3 of the R-exts document, it says to set PKG_* flags in
'Makeconf'; I think this should read 'src/Makevars'  (this paragraph in
general is pretty awkward reading).

3) I prefer PKG_LDFLAGS for the "-L" stuff and PKG_LIBS for the "-l"
statements (currently the docs say to put it all in PKG_LIBS).

4) page 5 of R-exts gives an example of using autoconf to enable/disable
R functions depending on whether or not a library is available;
currently it suggests putting a test in the body of the function that is
executed every time the function is called, even if the external library
exists.  This is confusing flow control with conditional compilation. 
Perhaps the example could be reworked so that the function itself is
defined differently depending on whether or not the external library is
found. (If the library does not exist, the function is defined to return
an error; otherwise define the function normally.)

Cheers,
Tim

Hi,
   I'm running debian - upgraded fully to potato at the start of the
freeze and added latest libgnome-dev before configuring.

   I tried compiling with gnome support with

/usr/local/R/R-0.99.0/configure --with-gnome

and got the following output:

According to dpkg I have:

According to apt-get libglade0 is the newest version, so I'm assuming that
0.11 is > 0.3  and there doesn't seem to be a *glade*dev* or anything, 
or that would have shown up.

Congrats on getting 0.99 out, and on the rapid convergence towards 1.0.
Attached below is the latest email in a very interesting thread about
building GNU Octave with the 'Atlas' (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra
Software) libraries that are drop-in replacements for (parts of) Lapack and
the Blas. Speed increases of up to 10 have been reported for simple matrix
multiplication (this is over Lapack/Blas used by Octave).  You can find the
whole thread at http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/mailing-lists/help-octave/2000/

Subject: Re: ATLAS and octave
Date: Wed, 9 Feb 2000 03:05:13 -0600 (CST)

Here is all I did to build a copy of Octave that uses ATLAS:

  1. build ATLAS

  2. merge all four of the libraries that the ATLAS build creates into
     a single libatlas.a and install it in /some/dir.

  3. relink Octave by running

       make SPECIAL_MATH_LIB=/some/dir/libatlas.a

That seems to be all that is needed.

Would it be possible to modify the ATLAS makefiles to just build a
libatlas.a?  Then Octave could simply have

  AC_CHECK_LIB(atlas, ATL_xerbla)

in the configure script, and set SPECIAL_MATH_LIB accordingly.

Things might get a little more complicated for shared libraries.  Some
systems seem to barf when multiple shared libraries define the same
symbol.  But it would probably be possible to solve that, either by
doing whatever is necesary to tell the dynamic linker not to barf, or
by omitting the duplicate symbols from libcruft.

BTW, I see the following speedup on my system (266MHz Pentium II):

  octave:1> a = rand (1000); b = rand (1000); 
  octave:2> t = cputime (); a * b; cputime () - t

  without ATLAS:  94.4 seconds
  with ATLAS:     10.5 seconds

Wow!

Thanks,

jwe

Note that the Debian Atlas libraries are tuned for a P2-350 with 512
cache; which for us is fine, since our MOSIX cluster is full of them.
It might be less optimal for P3's and P1's, since it's supposed to be
(according to the documentation at the original site, as well as the
Debian docs, last I looked) built on the configuration at hand... 

Nonetheless, it might be a worthwhile thing to explore...

Subject: [Rd] Row subsetting of data frames (PR#425)
Message-ID: <200002091738.SAA09768@pubhealth.ku.dk>

If you want to use row names to take a row subset of a data.frame then
there is a bug when
- One row has a name which is a completion of another row name
- The shorter name comes after the longer one
- You want to retrieve the row with the shorter name

An example:

R> x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames=list(c("abc","ab"), c("cde","cd")))
R> x
    cde cd
abc   1  3
ab    2  4
R> x["ab",]                       #Works OK for matrices
cde  cd 
  2   4 
R> y <- as.data.frame(x)
R> y["ab",]                       #but not for a data frame
    cde cd
abc   1  3

The problem boils down to

>  pmatch("ab", c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = T)
[1] 1

and the code expects 2, which is what S gives.  The description of

duplicates.ok: should duplicate matches be allowed?

     If there are multiple matches the result depends on the value of
     `duplicates.ok'. If this is false multiple matches will result in
     the value of `nomatch' being returned, and if it is true, the
     index of the first matching value will be returned.

is different from S: the argument in S refers to allowing
duplicates in x, so

> pmatch(rep("ab",3), c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = T)
[1] 2 2 2
> pmatch(rep("ab",3), c("abc", "ab"), duplicates.ok = F)
[1]  2  1 NA

A quick fix is in [.data.frame, to give

        if (is.character(i))
            i <- sapply(i, function(x) match(x, rows))

but I think we should make pmatch S-compatible.

Problem solved.
I was using dpkg -l \*glade\* to look for what I wanted instead of 
apt-cache search glade.

I installed the following packages:
libglade-gnome0-dev libgladexml-perl libglade0-dev

and everything worked fine.

See R --help. It is R --gui=GNOME, and that does work (in so far as
GNOME support works) for me.

Hmm. Should probably allow the alternate form in the startup script,
and for debugger as well. Did we really mean to make -g defunct, btw?

Yes, the "=" shouldn't be required (yet) anywhere, I think!

I think Kurt even promised to *NOT* make it defunct
(but still "deprecated").

It says in the NEWS:

    o   Long-named options with arguments such as `--vsize' now use the
        `--name=VALUE' form; the old `--name VALUE' is deprecated.

    o   New command line option `--gui' to specify the graphical user
        interface under Unix.  Currently, possible values are `X11' (the
        (default) and `GNOME', provided that GNOME support is available.
        Command line options \`-g' and `--gnome' are defunct.

which seems clear enough to me.  -gui GNOME never existed to be
deprecated!

Never said it did... However the point is that one gets an odd error
message if we don't catch the --gui argument, and while we're there
we might as well look for a following value.

Another options would be to have the script switch catch '--gui*'
instead of '--gui=*' and just let it barf on the absent binary. (The
sed bit should probably read sed -e 's/[^=]*=*//' then)

I'm no fan of removing short-form options in general. Whoever
disagrees should be forced to type "R --debugger=gdb" every time he
needs to restart during a bug hunt... ;)

                      COMPANY PROFILE

ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL is a leading producer of distribution equipment and one of the 
fastest growing private company of its kind in the Romanian economy.

The company is a specialist focused on distribution, protection and regulation of low voltage energy 
for residential homes, commercial buildings, malls, hotels and industrial facilities.

The line of products

* Switchboards for power distribution, control and automation
* Control panels for industrial processes
* Motor control centers
* Installation for power factor compensation
* Distribution panels and pillars 
* 19" enclosures
* Custom - tailored panels, produced and equipped according to the client` s needs.

The Production plant

Over 2500 m2 production areas, ensure complete execution of the switchboards, from the 
construction of the empties enclosures, continuing with the assembling of the electrical components 
and ending up with the final tests.

Given the fact that the company was customer-oriented from the outset, the flexibility required both 
in terms of design and fabrication could only be achieved by using the latest technologies and 
machinery.   

Loyal to this principle, ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL has launched a high scale investment 
policy, consisting in acquisition of modern machine-tools such as: CNC-machining center, CNC-press 
brake and installations for shielded welding (CO2, Argon) and spot welding, installation for powder 
coating etc.

As an innovative solutions provider, we have invested a lot in research and development and 
successfully launched new products, equipped with state-of-the art components such as: 
programmable controllers, static converters, process computers.
We even offer the planning, implementation, training and support that make everything go smoothly. 

Considerable investments in IT are being made to secure the company's competitive edge and 
growth in the years ahead. 

The components and materials used are of best possible quality, being purchased from renown 
companies from Germany (Siemens, ABB, Moeller), France (Schneider Electric, Akzo Nobel), Italy 
(Ansaldo, Microelletrica Scientifica, Lovatto) and others. Our clients are thus offered a wider choice 
and can obtain the most convenient performance/ cost  ratio.


The quality

The quality, one of the most important aspect of the market economy, was successfully taken care 
of,  by the introduction of the Quality Assurance System acccording to ISO 9001, verified and 
certified by TÜV CERT Germany (Certificate no.041007886).
The company has also been authorized by the Romanian Register of Shipping to execute panels for 
this particular domain of activity.

The people

We have built a world class infrastructure, as well as a successful team that sets the pace for the 
economic growth in the whole region. We also have a strong presence in Romania, our 
representatives cover virtually all the counties of the country.

At ELECTRO ALFA INTERNATIONAL you will find the availability of a flexible, dynamic and well 
trained workforce with unequalled expertise and experience; over 200 people work here with one 
objective in mind, to help our customers meet their business and technical needs. 


The market

Results had exceeded expectations because relatively low labour costs and high levels of 
production had enabled us to reach high levels of productivity and cost benefits.

Concrete plans exist for expansion to other key markets in Europe.

We've maintained continued growth in sales ($8 m last year), built a national leading brand and 
matured from a local start-up to a grown up company  within 8 years. All of which leaves us in great 
shape for the future.

Long term commitment and in-depth know-how. These hallmarks have earned us an unrivalled list of 
awards, and more importantly the trust of our partners in Romania

So, at last a company you can completely trust. Now is the time to profit from us!

Sorry folks,
   This isn't a gnome bug at all.  It has to do with make.

The binary is in RHOME, but /usr/local/bin/R is still the 0.90.0 script

The make failed half way through the install:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/demos'
make[1]: Entering directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/doc'
installing doc ...
/usr/bin/install: `../doc/html/search/index.txt' and
`/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/search/index.txt' are the same file
make[1]: *** [install-html] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/usr+/slashusr/local/lib/R/doc'
make: *** [install] Error 1

but because it was in the documentation section, I ignored it.
Dumb - I know. (for your info, /mnt/usr+/slashusr is symlinked to /usr)

This may have happened because I didn't clear out all the make after
failing the first make with gnome.

Message-ID: <200002110412.FAA27245@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

sorry about the empty bug-report that I seem to have filed earlier.
(I wrote it via `bug.report()' from within R using `emacsclient'.  I
wasn't aware that I have to save the file after pressing C-x # and
before sending it.)  Hopefully this time it will work......

I noticed the following problem with the on-line help system:

1) I start an R session and type help.start().  
2) In the web page that appears in my browser (Netscape 4.5) I select
   `Search Engine & Keywords'
3) For some keywords (e.g., htest [Statistics] and optimize
   [Mathematics]) in the Keywords by Section list, I get as result
that "no matches for XXXX have been found" if I select them.  But if I
enter those keywords into the text field that appears at the top of
the page and press return, the commands that are grouped under that
keyword are found.

Also, while playing around with these keywords and trying to figure
out what is going on (but, unfortunately, I don't know Javascript well
enough) I noticed that the new function `optim' has as keywords only
`nonlinear' but not `optimize'.  And again, if I select the keyword
`nonlinear' [Statistcs > Models > Regression > Nonlinear], optim does
not appear on the page of results.  But if I enter `nonlinear' into
the search text field, it appears on the page of results.

Cheers,

        Berwin Turlach

Subject: [Rd] R hangs sometimes and crashes (PR#429)
Message-ID: <200002111054.LAA01706@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Kjetil Kjernsmo
Version: 0.65.1
OS: Digital UNIX 4.0
Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.172)


I have the following R code:

ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

photonsincidenttodetectorbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds,
avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
{
  sc <- ampmean - ampmode
  if(sc <= 0) stop("Mean Amplification must be greater than Mode Amplification")

  ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
  return(sum(rgamma(ncb, ampmean / sc, sc) * rpois(ncb, avgphotonfromcloud)))
}



photonsdetectedbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud,
sensitivity, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(rpois(1, sensitivity * photonsincidenttodetectorbin(binno,
ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode, ampmean, numberofbins, linewidth)))

lensedprofile <- function(ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, sensitivity, ampmode
= 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
  return(apply(cbind(x1 =
-as.integer(numberofbins/2):as.integer(numberofbins/2)), 1, photonsdetectedbin,
ntotalclouds, avgphotonfromcloud, sensitivity, ampmode, ampmean, numberofbins,
linewidth))

And I have experienced quite often that in 'photonsdetectedbin', R hangs. That
is, while 
it normally takes a second to get an array with the numbers, I let it run for
550 minutes
on an alphaev6 without anything happening. It seemed that it hanged more
frequently for 
small values of ntotalclouds (<8000), but that may not be the case. Anyway, it
happens 
only occasionally, sometimes a call like 
 plot(lensedprofile(10000,1,0.1, ampmean=3), type='l')
will produce a plot instantly, sometimes it will not....
Just now, R crashed, and that is when I figured I should send a bug report...
ESS said:
Process R segmentation fault at Fri Feb 11 11:40:15 2000
Unfortunately, I haven't got a core dump, I've disabled them, I could enable it
if you'd like.

I hope running lensedprofile a number of times will reproduce the problem, but
you never know,
as I haven't been able to narrow the problem down. I haven't had any problems
with 
photonsincidenttodetectorbin, though.

I haven't found any other relevant bug reports.

Well, good time for a bug report like this as I have re-worked the
search engine yesterday (to allow more flexibility and automatic
creation of keyword lists). I see the problems you describe in the old
version, but fortunately:

Clicking on htest now lists all of ctest together with several other
pages.

optimize also gives a non-empty return (though function optim misses
the keyword, I'll fix that).

optim is listed under nonlinear in the new version.

Thanks a lot for the bug report,

Mmmh, seems as if I really should change my options as I seem to keep
sending off empty bug-reports ;-/ Sorry guys.  Here is the content
that should have been in the last e-mail:

`R CMD check nlme' fails on my machine.  The final output in
nlme-Ex.Rout is:

> library(nlme)
> data(Soybean)
> fm1 <- nlme(weight ~ SSlogis(Time, Asym, xmid, scal), data = Soybean,

Error in nlme.formula(weight ~ SSlogis(Time, Asym, xmid, scal), data = Soybean,  : 
	Maximum number of iterations reached without convergence
Execution halted

I presume that `R CMD check MASS' fails for some similar reason.  The
final output in MASS-Ex.Rout is:

Subject: [Rd] behaviour of bug.report (PR#432)
Message-ID: <200002111209.NAA02992@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

it seems that I am in the mood of filing bug reports.  Partly because
R-1.0 is approaching fast, partly to explain why I have send (yet)
another empty bug report.  

My settings are as follows:
> options()$mailer
[1] "mailx"
> options()$method
NULL
> options()$editor
[1] "emacsclient"

My first attempt to send the last bug-report about "R CMD check
[nlme|MASS" was:

> bug.report(subject="`R CMD check [nlme|MASS]' fails")
Waiting for Emacs...Done
Submit the bug report? y
Sending email ...
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
sh: unexpected EOF while looking for `''
sh: -c: line 2: syntax error
Sending email failed!
The unsent bug report can be found in file R.bug.report 

Obviously, something didn't like the `'' in the subject line.  Can it
be escaped?

Next I typed:
> bug.report(subject="R CMD check [nlme|MASS] fails")

And emacs asked me if I wanted to revert the buffer of file XXXX from
its latest version.  To this I answered `no' since the R.bug.report
buffer still contained the messages that I wanted to send and a `yes'
answer would have put the bug report template into that buffer.  As
expected, I got into the buffer with the report still there.  Upon
pressing `C-x #' I got back to the R session and was asked whether I
wanted to send the bug report:

Waiting for Emacs...Done
Submit the bug report? y
Sending email ...

To my surprise, I then noticed that the empty template was send and
not the report.  I gues the "real" report was only in the buffer and
never written back to the file R.bug.report.  But I kind of wonder
whether emacs or R is to blame for this problem.......

Cheers,

        Berwin

Subject: [Rd] astonishing memory phenomenon
Message-ID: <000501bf7489$a0811960$a9021aac@joelschlaegel>



I have a question concerning memory.

I understood that R takes a fixed amount of memory at startup (which I can
influence with --vsize --nsize) and that gc() shows the memory still free of
the total memory reserved for R.

However, if I create a long vector of character data, gc() only seem to
reflect the space needed for a vector of pointers to char, the space used
for the character data itself is ... hidden!?

Here the data: I have 6 MB heap, and can do

> x <- rep(1, 350000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61034 250000  4.8
Vcells 350955 786432  6.0
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61036 250000  4.8
Vcells 700956 786432  6.0

which is using about 2.67 MB RAM for double numbers.

Trying for 3.05 MB fails (well, rep() obviously needs twice the memory, x <-
double(700000) works)

> x <- rep(1, 400000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
Error: heap memory (6144 Kb) exhausted [needed 3125 Kb more]
       See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.

Now character data, gc() tells us, that we need half that much RAM as
compared to double numbers.
for empty character WHATEVER SIZE THE CHARACTER DATA HAVE

> x <- rep(paste(rep("0", 0), collapse=""), 700000); gc(); rm(x); gc()
         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61036 250000  4.8

         free  total (Mb)
Ncells  61039 250000  4.8

Error: heap memory (6144 Kb) exhausted [needed 2734 Kb more]
       See "help(Memory)" on how to increase the heap size.


Furthermore the last x successfully  created should contain data of size
700000*4096 Bytes corresponding to  700000*4096/1024/1024 = 2734 MB, which
is impossible given the startup memory, impossible given RAM, impossible
given that no swaping occurs, furthermore the OS (WinNT4) never shows any
additional memory eaten up except that taken at startup.

What's going on?

Subject: [Rd] Something strange in "?assign"? (PR#433)
Message-ID: <200002111222.NAA03218@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the assign helpfile (0.90.1) the "assign" function is

function (x, value, pos = -1, envir = sys.frame(sys.parent()),
  inherits = FALSE, immediate = TRUE)

which is not quite the implementation, which is

function (x, value, pos = -1, envir = pos.to.env(pos), inherits = FALSE, 
  immediate = TRUE)

This seems to have the following interesting effect.

"short.fun" <- function() {make(); ls()}
"make" <- function() assign("x", 3, envir = sys.frame(sys.parent()))

short.fun()	# gives an x as I would expect

"make" <- function() assign("x", 3)

short.fun()	# now there's nothing here!

But since I have simply duplicated the default value, according to the
help file, I would expect these two "make" functions to behave
identically.  Is this to be expected, and if not, is this because the
definition of "assign" is slightly different to that in the help file?

Many thanks, Jonathan.

OK, that's a bug, in the documentation.

However, it is not a bug that sys.frame(sys.parent()) gives different
results as a default argument and as a supplied one. One is evaluated
in the function, the other in the caller!

> "short.fun" <- function() {make(); ls()}

Try changing make() to function() {assign("x", 3);print(ls())}

To run CMD check on MASS you need to set R_NSIZE in the environment.
500k should do.  MASS passes here on Solaris, Linux and Windows, if one
is patient enough.  I will point out that information is in the on-line
R complements, page 11.

I have just tried nlme on linux and 0.99.0 and example(nlme.formula)
does fail there in CMD check, eventually.

What MASS does not do is make a PDF manual, and that is mainly due to 
problems with the definitions of what needs to be escaped in the 
.Rd files.  A new version will follow once that is resolved
(which may need 1.0.0).

Um, looks like nlsList is not failing gracefully when memory is exhausted,
presumably because restart is in use.

You only have one character data object, of length 0, 4096, 8192,
and lots of references to it.  You don't need multiple copies of the same
data.

Try this again with a character vector of different strings.

Object sharing, and more generally a copy-if-changed strategy.

The subject is used as argument to the command line option -s of mailx

Thanks for the explanation Brian!

This (definitely clever) behaviour of R makes it more difficult to decide,
HOW to import large amounts of data, if the data type is DATE. Dates could
be imported as CHARACTER or as DOUBLE (chron-objects).

Memory requirements of chron would be approx   n*8 Bytes
Memory requirements of character dates like "01/01/2000" would be n*4 + u*10
Memory requirements of character times like "23:03:20" would be n*4 + u*8
Memory requirements of character date-times like "01/01/2000 23:03:20" would
be n*4 + u*19
where n=no of cases and u=no of unique values

Concerning date-times from

  n*8 < n*4 + u*19

we get

  n/u < 4.75

as a condition for the chron object beeing smaller than a character
representation, thus the answer is: IT DEPENDS.

BTW: Is there any specific reason that currently we cannot have chron
objects as columns of data.frames?

As far as I remember, I did not save the file before pressing `C-x #'.
But then, I also did not change the buffer, so I was not asked whether
I wanted to save the file  after pressing `C-x #'.  That's why I made
sure that I modified the buffer on my next attempt.

I guess the following happened:
1) bug.report created the standard template in the file R.bug.report
   and called emacsclient.
2) emacsclient noticed that the content of the file on the disk
   differed from the content of the R.bug.report buffer and asked me
whether I wanted to revert to the version on the disk.  To this I
stated no.  But the content of the buffer was not saved into the file.
3) I saw the buffer with the text that I wanted to send and entered
   `C-x #'.  Since the buffer hadn't be modified, emacs does not ask
whether you want to save it too the file and just exists.
4) bug.report asks whether you want to mail the bug report and on
   answering `yes' mails the file R.bug.report which is on the disk.
In this case the empty template.

This description kind of convinces me that every part worked as it was
designed to do, it's just that it gave a rather unexpected result....

Cheers,

        Berwin

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10002110817290.953-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


I have done a little bit of poking around at the bug that I reported
earlier (steep slopes and lines from far outside the plot range doing
funny things), and have tracked it down to the fact that, as noted in the
Unix man page, XDrawLine[s] doesn't like coordinates that are outside of
the range of (-32767,32767).

Now the question is, what to do about this?  A quick "fix" (not a fix but
at least an acknowledgement of the problem) would check coordinates in
GLine() and issue a warning instead of trying to draw anything if any of
the coordinates was outside the allowed range (would one have to add a
per-driver piece of information giving the min and max vals?).

I wrote a prototype of some clipping code in R that I could translate to C
and stick into src/unix/devX11.c right before every call to XDrawLine or
XDrawLines.  Before I go to that trouble, though: is there a better way to
do this?  Is there already clipping code lying around somewhere else in R?  
Is there a way to do this generically (perhaps by adding an outer clipping
region to every device at its device-coordinate limits) that would
centralize the code and not require it to be repeated for every
driver/line-drawing call?

 Any thoughts?  I'd really like to get this fixed ...

Hmm.  I got it to pass on my Intel Linux machine.  I'll take another
look.

R CMD check nlme does require a large vsize and nsize and a lot of
patience but I did get

The difference is not in rw0901/rw0990 but in the version of chron
in use.  There is an rw0901 version of chron 2.2-2 too.

That happens for me on Unix.  If there is not already a bug report, send one.

The hanging is happening under the current Rpre1.0.0.  It occurs inside
Rf_pois, called with mu=0.

I consistently get a sig11 on one file:

gcc -I. -I../include -I../../src/include -I../../src/include/R_ext 
-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -mieee-fp -g -O2 -c fft.c -o fft.o
gcc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11
make[3]: *** [fft.o] Error 1

However, other files and parts of the tree compile still.  (When I had a sig11
being 
caused by a memory fault, once it sig11'd, it would sig11 again.)   I can even
do a
successful kernel compile.  Just not that one file.  I tried removing the ^L
from the
file with no effect.  I'm stumped and am grabbing the latest devel tarball to
see if
that does the same.

C compilers can do that all by themselves occasionally. Which version
are we talking about? Does it work to change the optimisation level
for the file?

Reducing the optimisation to O1 compiles it, but O3 still does
the sig11.  Thanks.  Problem cured if not explained.

Now that *is* pretty odd because I have

$ gcc -v
Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

(Of course Redhat sometimes fixes bugs before making their RPMs...)

Currently, chron objects are stored as numeric vectors with certain
attributes (such as `origin').  I don't see how you could keep the
attributes ...

If I ever get to it, there may be a future version of chron based on a
struct tm like representation.

And I'd prefer to keep it like that.  As I think I already mentioned,
the naming is patterned after autoconf, which distinguishes

 - Variable: LDFLAGS
     Stripping (`-s') and any other miscellaneous options for the
     linker.

 - Variable: LIBS
     `-l' and `-L' options to pass to the linker.

You mean to have

  if(@HAVE_FOO@) {
     foo <- function(x) { ... }
  }
  else {
     foo <- function(x) { stop("...") }
  }

???

That's obviously more efficient, but (as far as I am concerned) not yet
optimal, as it results in ugly conditional code.  When using autoconf, I
think it is far better to use fragments, roughly along the following
lines.  In configure.in, do

  if test "${HAVEFOO}" = TRUE; then
    foo_frag=R/frag/code-for-foo-T.R
  else
    foo_frag=R/frag/code-for-foo-F.R
  fi
  AC_SUBST_FILE(foo_frag)

In one of the .R.in files in the R dir, you can then do

  @foo_frag@

and get configure-time conditional inclusion without any run-time
testing.

(I did not test whether the above works ... can someone please do that?
I will then modify R-exts.texi accordingly.)

Thanks,
-k

The new version of chron (currently, 2.2-2) has added Y2K improvements
as described in file `Y2K' in the chron sources.  Roughly speaking, by
setting options appropriately, it is ensured that two-digit year abbrevs
continue to work ``correctly'' (using a cut-off mechanism to determine
the ``correct'' century).

Note that currently, chron/dates only supports formats like "m/d/y" or
"mdy" where all three signify (2-digit) abbreviations, or non-abbrev
formats such as "day mon year" where now month must be one of "Jan",
"Feb", etc. and corresponding versions with full month names.  A format
like yours, "d/m/Y" in strftime(3) notation, is not supported.

For example,

  as.numeric(dates("1 Jan 2000", format = "day mon year"))
  => 10957

as it should.

David James and I have had some conversation about improving chron.  For
him this is not necessarily high priority, as S-PLUS 5 has adopted their
own timeDate objects.  In R, we can either try implementing that, or
come up with a much improved chron, which would be my preference.  (As I
wrote yesterday, one idea is to use struct tm style representations for
chron objects.)  I will not get to this within the next few weeks
though ...

Meanwhile, it is always possible to write a function which parses the
given format correctly, and pass it on as the `format' argument.

there is clipping code in R (see, e.g,. CScliplines in graphics.c)

whether it gets called or not depends on the canClip flag in the DevDesc
structure.  If this is
false (0) then the R clipping code gets called, otherwise R gets the device
to do the clipping.
currently, the X11 device has canClip = 1 so none of the R clipping code
gets called.

NOTE that getting R to do the clipping serves two purposes:  (i) it clips
(wow !)  (ii) it prevents silly values getting sent to the device

a quick fix then is to simply set canClip = 0 in devX11.c

this is a bit of overkill though because we really only want to do (ii)
above

one solution would be to get R to check for silly values (e.g., clip to devi
ce extent) regardless of the canClip flag, which wouldn't be too much work
because the clipping code is all in place.

i think that would be preferable to making each device responsible for
checking for silly values.

Not to mention that it would break *text* clipping, which R can only
simulate pretty half-heartedly!

Subject: [Rd] More plotting comments
Message-ID: <20000214202323.A12789@ftoomsh.progsoc.uts.edu.au>

None of this is greatly important but might be a bit useful to someone.
BTW, I have 0.99a installed, it compiled without a problem.

I've discovered most of the plotting facilities including the legend()
function and the various text annotations, this is nice an convenient
and flexible enough to do most things. One thing that I must say is that
the help pages on plot() and plot.default() really SHOULD include legend()
in the see-also list because I tried all sorts of things before I found it,
apropos( "key" ), apropos( "note" ), apropos( "annotate" ).

Another tiny thing, is there an official way to put angles or temperature
on a graph? I have been using expression(90^o) for a 90 degree angle which
looks OK but kind of cheats the philosophy of the expression system.
Does anything matter other than how it looks when it prints?

Finally, when I do a plot like this:

	curve( sin, lty="12345678" )

I get a reasonable looking curved line on my X11 window but then I
do the same thing in postscript I get the interesting result that the
dashes are very tiny when viewed in ghostscript (5.10) but sensible
length on paper from the printer. Is this a ghostscript bug or is there
something non-portable about R output files?

An simple example of setting up an eps output for a report might be
helpful because a lot of people will be doing it. Just a suggestion:

ps.options( horizontal=FALSE, onefile=FALSE, paper="special" )
postscript( "/tmp/test.eps", width=4, height=3 )
par( mar=c( 3.5, 3.5, 0, 0 ), ps=10, mgp=c( 2.5, 1, 0 ))
curve( sin, 0, 2 * pi, lty="1494" )
dev.off()

I know it isn't as flashy as some of the existing examples but it does
demonstrate the typical things that you are going to need such as
point sizes, paper sizes, margins, etc. It is also something that can
quickly be grabbed and used by most people.

It looks fine here with ghostscript 6.0.  5.10 is rather old (yes,
I know it is the current GPL version).

I think it is better to set pointsize on the call to postscript().

And possibly confuse them. Not everyone wants to move the labels
around, and in general I think zeroing the margins is a bad idea.
In the technical sense of S graphics you want to include figure regions
not plot regions in other publications.  (In years of doing this
and scores of publications I have only once moved the axis labels.)

Actually, 5.50 is, but you can be excused for not knowing that
(released Feb 13....)

The plot looks OK in 5.50 too.

If your postscript viewer performs antialiasing, small features like
these will smear; try it with antialiasing turned off and see if it
looks more like what you expect.

try ...
    expression(90*degree)

also, for angles, there are ...
    expression(60*minute)
    expression(30*second)

the documentation for mathematical annotation (in 0.99.0) is quite out of
date, but it will be updated for 1.0.0

Subject: [Rd] Error report on empty matrices (PR#435)
Message-ID: <200002142012.VAA28984@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers:

When using R.0.99a (Version 0.99.0 Patched (February 9, 2000), source
compiled with gcc under SuSE 6.2) on a PIII 500Mhz Machine under SuSE
6.2 Linux I found the following bug:

  x <- matrix(0,10,0)    
  rbind(x,2)

causes an R-crash with the message "Gleitkomma-Ausnahme" (floating point
exception) which is probably due to the non-applicability of the
recyling rule.

The same occors when using
  x<-matrix(0,10,0)
  rbind(x,matrix(2,1,1))

The complete log is appended to this note.

In my opinion an error message like

  Error in rbind(...) : number of columns of matrices must match (see
arg 2)   

as it happens with

  x<-matrix(0,10,1)    
  rbind(x,matrix(0,1,0))  

should be given in both erroneous cases. 

Best regards 

      Ulrich Küsters

Full_Name: Jose M. Perez
Version: 0.99.0a
OS: Linux - 2.0.38
Submission from: (NULL) (159.90.200.68)


Hi,
I'm having problems with the check of
infinite recursion in the expression evaluation 
depth.
The problem appears in a program with no recursions
whatsoever. The layout of my program is a series
of routines called by a big loop.
I printed out depthsave in  src/main/eval.c
and it appears as there is an error popping out
the length of the expression stack, R_EvalDepth,
somewhere. As the loop goes, R_EvalDepth goes up
and down, but in average, it alway increases.

For the moments, I commented out the check with
options$expression and my program finished succesfully.
Any help would be appreciated.

Sounds nasty, but I think we need to have a code sample exhibiting the
behaviour in order to investigate it. Could you try shaving your
example down to something smaller which still has the problem?

The second case should have this. The first case should (I think) return
an 11x0 matrix and give a recycling warning.

That is, rbind(x,2) should append a 2  to all the columns of x.

Subject: [Rd] Autocovariance function (PR#438)
Message-ID: <200002142340.AAA29883@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I am reporting some problems with the autocovariance
function (acf) with the following facts:

First I defined a time series, x, which is a vector
created by x <- ts(rnorm(200)).  Then I plugged the
series directly into the acf function, acf(x) and an
error message popped up as:

Error in .C("acf", as.double(x), s.integer(sampleT),
as.integer(nser),  : C/Fortran function name not
in load table.

I did the library ts but the problem still persists.

That's exactly what I was looking for!

Exactly right, I'm using `gs' and turning off antialiasing fixes it.
I'm surprised at how different the line looks with antialiasing on and off,
I didn't realise the filter was quite so intense.

I guess there is something I'm not understanding here. If I draw a diagram
in xfig and export to eps then it exports exactly that diagram, trimmed
right to the edges of whatever lines are in that picture. Then I import
it into Latex which takes the bounding box and presumes everything in that
box is picture. Latex then adds a little space before and after the picture,
and centres the picture in the column of text. I add the caption under the
figure at the Latex stage rather than have it built into the figure because
that provides automatic figure numbering, font consistency, indexing,
references in the text, etc.

So from R, I expected to get a plot (as an eps file) which is trimmed right
back to the edges of the plot, then I can drop it into Latex exactly the
same as my xfig diagrams, put a caption on them the same way and get the
same spacing as other figures in the report. In addition, giving Latex
responsibility for the margins means that you get the rubbery glue that
juggles items to fit the page evenly.

I can perfectly understand that there are situations where users won't
want to use Latex, they might want to print a whole page of plots without
wanting to include it in a document or they might want to include it in
a different document processor (maybe something WYSIWYG where margins in
the plot are helpful). Formatting styles change in different disciplines,
for whatever reason Engineers tend to pack things in tightly. Anyhow,
I'm just providing some feedback from my own perspective.

And you will see the centring looks wrong, as the `box' is not centred but
the box plus text on the left only. Professionals tell me this is a common
mistake by LaTeX users.  (Actually, LaTeX does not add any space
before or after the picture, although your macro package might, and the
`center' environment does. The standard graphics inclusion mechanism,
graphicx, builds a TeX box exactly enclosing the bounding box.)

There is too little information here: please use bug.report() to submit bug
reports, and give the exact code you used so we can try exactly the same
thing. A good quick test is to run

library(ts)
example(acf)

However,

library(ts)
x <- ts(rnorm(200))
acf(x)

also works on all my (0.90.1 from a later message) systems, so I suggest
you re-build and re-install R, and run make check as that will run the acf
examples.

Subject: [Rd] rpois gives a large number repeatedly (PR#439)
Message-ID: <200002151118.MAA04594@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Kjetil Kjernsmo
Version: 0.65.1
OS: Digital UNIX 4.0
Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.172)


I'm experiencing problems with rpois. Occasionally, it draws a very high
number.
Yeah, I know, this is statistics, things like that does happen, but this really

strange because a poisson distribution with a parameter of 3 shouldn't see the 
number 1932 very often, but the same, incredibly high number is drawn
repeatedly.

These are the two relevant functions, the latter somewhat expanded for debugging
purposes.

ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

photonsincidenttodetectorbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds,
avgphotonfromcloud, ampmode = 1, ampmean = 2, numberofbins = 100, linewidth =
numberofbins / 6)
{
  sc <- ampmean - ampmode
  if(sc <= 0) stop("Mean Amplification must be greater than Mode Amplification")

  ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
  rg <- rgamma(ncb, ampmean / sc, sc)
  rp <- rpois(ncb, avgphotonfromcloud)
  dr <- rg * rp
  if(sum(dr) > 25000) print(cbind(rg, rp, dr, avgphotonfromcloud, ncb))
  return(sum(dr))
}

The if-line is included to trigger unusual events, and I just had output like
this:

Actually, it seems like this large number may dependent of the session one is
in. 
I get 1932 on an XP1000 with an 500MHz alphaev6, but on my own computer, which
is an PWS500au with
an 500MHz alphaev56, I have seen the number 11344 repeatedly. It could of course
be the 
seed or something, I guess.

I can't seem to generate anything unusual with the latest R snapshot.
Perhaps it would help if you told us what parameters to call
photonsincidenttodetectorbin with?

Yep, it's old.... When v1.0.0 comes, I guess I'll get the UNIX people to
install it.

Whoops, sorry, I use 
x <- cbind(-50:50)
apply(x, 1, photonsincidenttodetectorbin, 100000, 3)

Anyway, coming back from lunch, I was unable to reproduce it with this
call, after trying about 50 times... This call made the problem show up
almost every time half an hour ago. I bet there is someone sitting inside
the computer having a good time right now... :-) However, I was able to
reproduce it once in about 10 trails by calling 
plot(lensedprofile(100000,3,1), type='l')
which is a function defined by the rest of my code, that I have attached. 

Best,

Kjetil

However, the older version of chron DID allow creating CORRECT chron objects

wheras backformatting in the print method failed

thus I tend to see it as a bug, because it may break old code.

Still, I don't know whether it is approbriate to send a bug report to
r-bugs@lists.r-project.org ?

There's an "Add-Ons" slot in the bug repository. We're not forcing package
managers to actually read it and go fix their bugs, though...

I can't reproduce this with either of my pre1.0.0 versions, but I can
reproduce it with a 13/10/99 0.90devel version (ie, just a few weeks
past 0.65.1)

It looks as if the bug has been stomped since then. I can't see how,
though.  Looking at cvs diff I don't see any changes in the logic between
then and the mu<=0 fix a few days ago.

I spoke too soon -- There is an operating system or hardware issue
involved

Today's pre1.0.0 reproduces Kjetil's bug on Solaris 2.7 with
 f77: WorkShop Compilers 5.0 98/12/15 FORTRAN 77 5.0
and
 gcc 2.95.2
On the same machine, but (I think) with earlier versions of both compilers
the bug also happens using a 13 Sept R-devel snapshot.

The bug does not happen with today's pre1.0.0 on Debian Linux
2.2.13-mosix, gcc 2.95.2,  GNU Fortran 0.5.25 19991030 

The fact that the _same_ large number is returned suggests some sort of
memory protection problem, though the machine-dependence doesn't.

The code has (plot3d.c, ca line 718)

		/* Need to send labels in from interpreted R code ? */
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.00f ", zc);

so, yes, it is printed as an integer, and the comment there is right.  
I guess the labels should be format(levels) by default, to ensure that
the use of trailing zeros is consistent, but it should be in R code
so users can override the default precision, say.

Subject: [Rd] rug() extends axes instead of clipping (PR#442)
Message-ID: <200002160937.KAA16786@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear R developers,

I noticed that rug() may extend the line of the horizontal axis beyond
the left and right vertical axes.  The following snippet illustrates
the problem:

set.seed(2241)
dat <- rnorm(10) 
plot(c(-2,2),c(0,0.5),type="n", xlab="", ylab="")
rug(dat)

The problem seems to be that:
> range(dat)
[1] -2.739635  1.037512

Cheers,

        Berwin

The docs to rle state that it works for vectors whereas it only works
for numerical vectors. Either the docs or the function should be
changed. The latter is easy: change the diff != 0 to a shifted logical
comparison. Jim

Pre-0.65.1 workspaces? I had not envisaged anyone would still have those.

Fix: in GetRNGstate in RNG.c add the second line of

	default:
	    RNG_kind = RNG_DEFAULT; N01_kind = 0;
	    error(".Random.seed[1] is NOT a valid RNG kind (code)");

Thanks for finding the relevant piece of code.  I did look, but wasn't
au fait enough with C or the R way of doing things to spot the relevant
piece.

How about replacing:
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.00f ", zc);
by:
	        sprintf(buffer, " %.9g ", zc);

It seems to do what I want, and not behave any differently from before
for integer contour lines.

Graphics/442 talks about rug() extending the axis when the range of new values
is bigger than the plot.  This also happens if there are NAs in the data:

x <- c(rnorm(10),NA)
hist(x)
rug(x)

will make the x axis extending off the page to the left.  This seems to be a bug
in axis(at=x), which should either ignore missing values or abort.

I know that the use of a ***character*** matrix is not documented for

Thanks for the report: now fixed. rbinom was only checking if p was
unchanged, and not setting up correctly if n changed too.

[Directed back to R-bugs, and please keep it there!]

OK, there are two issues here:

(a) matrix subscripting doesn't work with character type. Plain and
simple. A matrix subscript just get flattened into a character vector
and then used for subscripting. We might want to give an error instead
or simply implement the expected behaviour, but not this close to a
major release, I think. (Splus cant do this either)

(b) There's a bug in string indexing:

  x<-1:2
  x[c("2","2")]<-2
  x

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. <etc>

It seems to happen only when there are repeated indices. The bug is
that the names component of x which is originally empty isn't filled
with "" for the first elements as it usually is but has NULL (0x0)
pointers there.

Will dig deeper...

I think that is the correct behaviour. (What is the expected
behaviour?  It is what I expected.) A k-index (aka matrix or array
subset) is supposed to give the indices of the elements to be
extracted/replaced. I suppose character values could be matched to
dimnames, but that would be a new idea.  We might want to *warn*.

On the other hand, S-PLUS's print routine seems to ignore the added
elements, and R loses the dim attribute.

repeated *new *indices.

The hackery in StringSubscript was copying the wrong string as a name
for duplicate string indices. Fixed.

Right.

As usual when length and dims develops a mismatch... R is saner, I think

So did I but not correctly (had indexnames instead of s). Thanks.

Subject: [Rd] splitstr documentation problem (PR#451)
Message-ID: <200002182127.WAA14595@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Using the patched version of R-0.99.0, I cannot reproduce the following
example from the strsplit  documentation:

(Example)
unlist(strsplit("a.b.c", "."))  
## [1] "" "" "" "" "" 
## Note that `split' is a regexp!  
## If you really want to split on `.', use
unlist(strsplit("a.b.c", "\."))
## [1] "a" "b" "c"

The problem is in the second example; the "\." should be "\\."  

Thanks for the great software.

Subject: [Rd] problem with glm (PR#452)
Message-ID: <200002190151.CAA15336@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

(Two suggestions which are in the current snapshot follow. Looks like
what is which header varies a bit.)

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

#define STDC_HEADERS 1

at the top of regex.c.  (I am not convinced that is the cause here.)

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

Dear R-helpers,
	with R-0.99a, Linux, Red-Hat 6.1 derivat (Halloween Linux) I have
the following Problem with this code:

graphics.off()

                 byrow=T )                         
split.screen(temp)
plot(1:100)
screen(2)
plot(1:100)
close.screen(all=T)
dev.print(postscript,"/tmp/xx.ps")


system("gv /tmp/xx.ps &",T)

fails with (gv Version 3.5.8):

I fixed this earlier today (for 1.0.0, as it was in the R-bugs database as
PR# 378).  You need a screen to split!  So for now precede
split.screen(temp) by plot.new() or frame() or explicitly open a graphics
device.

Your example works on the current snapshot.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Message-ID: <38B1AB06.442E5285@bank-banque-canada.ca>

I'm impressed with all the new options for RNG setting (although, I now
have to re-work the way I was doing some of this). Would it be possible
to add  "default" as a legitimate value for kind and normal.kind in
RNGkind and set.seed? This would be used to set things back to R's
default settings (which may change from time to time with new versions).

Yes, added that. We do not intend to change the defaults again, but
someone may discover something wrong with what we have.

Subject: [Rd] reproducing Box-Muller numbers
Message-ID: <38B2D4D9.5B4A0C50@bank-banque-canada.ca>

There seems to be a minor problem with reproducing numbers from rnorm with
Box-Muller. The pattern suggests it might have something to do with the value
that gets dropped when an odd number of numbers is requested. (Details below.)

Also, could "user-supplied" be added as an option for normal.kind in RNGkind.
I'm sure the Box-Muller in R is better than my own attempt, but I would like to
be able to reproduce results I've obtained in the past.

Yes, it is. I wouldn't recommend that generator, but Martin M requested it
(and for .Random.seed to store the normal type).

I'll make a call to set.seed clear the saved value. That's all we intend to
be reproducible, setting the state by set.seed.

Not very easily, and we are in feature freeze for 1.0.0 now, so not before
1.1.0. It would be easy to patch in your own version, but the 
difficulty is to add all the protection needed for user-supplied code.

I'm  not sure what you mean by this. Are you suggesting that setting
.Random.seed directly is not intended to give reproducible results? I presume
not, but if so, then set.seed needs better control over the seed (i.e. vector
seeds).

When are you expecting 1.1.0? I can easily patch the version used by my library,
but for obvious reasons I would prefer not to post a library that does this. A
very large number of my code tests do not work if I cannot reproduce previous
rnorm random numbers.

Users are not expected to set .Random.seed directly, period. set.seed()
sets one of 2^32 separate seeds: why do you need more?

1.1.0 is not yet announced, but the feature freeze for 1.0.0 has been for
several weeks (on developer.r-project.org). I presume the numbers you want
to reproduce were not standard R before?

I've been using the same random numbers since R 0.49, the last time the uniform
RNG was modified. Before that I was using the same numbers since R 0.16. There
was considerable discussion when the change was made in 0.49 and it was agreed
that in future there would be an effort to make the numbers reproducible. I
certainly agree with improvements, but if you mess up reproducibility you are on
a very slippery slope.

My tests set "Wichmann-Hill", and mostly set the seed to c(979,1479,1542), which
I previously
could do with set.seed, but that has changed in 0.99.

>I presume the numbers you want

I'm not sure what you mean by standard R before, but I have been using my own
version of Box-Muller so that I can be sure to be able to work around changes in
rnorm. I can still do that but for obvious reasons I would prefer not to post a
library that takes control of that part of R.

If you use set.seed and then run, there is reproducibility, It is *not*
messed up.  What is not guaranteed is that user manipulation of
.Random.seed will work unless you stick to the previous options.
There is 100% backwards compatibility.

There was no set.seed prior to 0.99.0!  If you set the .Random.seed to
c(0,979,1479,1542), you will get the same results as before, but without
the warning that has been there for a year now that you needed the zero.

So, no change. Anything you could do in 0.63.1 you can do in 0.99.0.
If you want to take advantage of the new facilities, you need to heed the
current documentation.

Brian

I presume that I misunderstand something, but if I do not then I think
there is a serious problem for the way many people actually use RNGs
(rather than studying or testing them). To summarize the way I
understand the documentation and what you have said:

1/ Directly setting the .Random.seed is not something that users should
do and will not in the future be guaranteed to put the RNG into a state
that would reproduce a sequence of random numbers. Users should use
set.seed to put the RNG in a known state. (BTW, I was using my syskern
library version of set.seed before, which just set .Random.seed. Sorry
about the confusion.)

2/ set.seed takes only a single integer as an argument, so there is no
guaranteed way to query the state of the RNG at any given time, and then
reset it to that state at a later time.

If this second point is true, then I fear there is a serious problem.

It is guaranteed to reproduce it, but not to be a valid state if it
were never generated.  So replace `known' by `valid'.

Yes, there is an almost guaranteed way, but only if you restore a previous
value of .Random.seed. The problem is that for complicated generators it is
almost impossible to check if the supplied value is a reasonable one,
so we don't.

The exceptions are non-stateless variate generators, and the Box-Muller one
is such and has a warning to that effect, now:

Note:

     `.Random.seed' saves the seed set for the uniform random-number
     generator, at least for the system generators. It does not
     necessarily save the state of other generators, and in particular
     does not save the state of the Box-Muller normal generator. If you
     want to reproduce work later, call `set.seed' rather than set
     `.Random.seed'.

Incidentally, changes to both rpois and rbinom mean that you may get
different numbers of uniforms drawn and hence different results in the
future. That's life, I am afraid.

I thought Box-Muller just transformations uniform numbers? Does its
state just refer to whether an even or odd number of numbers have been
produced, and in the later case keep the last one for using the next
time?

>If you want to reproduce work later, call `set.seed' rather than set
`.Random.seed'.

But then I'm back to the original problem (which fortunately does not
seem to be a problem for the uniform generator): Using B-M for rnorm I
can't query the state at any given time and then reliably reset to that
state?

Yes. So use a more reliable option for norm_rand.

ok.  It seems that reliable here refers to the fact that the implementation does
not allow the state of the Box-Muller generator to be queried. I'm not an expert
on these things. Would you recommend one of the the other normal generators on a
theoretical basis too?

Problem seems to be that mnhyper as defined doesn't like extreme
arguments, and is being called with

 1/.Machine$double.eps

e.g.

> get("mnhyper",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[2]])(1000000000000000)
[1] NaN
> get("mnhyper",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[2]])(100000000000000)
[1] 21

The code looks like this:

    if (ncp == 0) 
        return(lo)
    if (ncp == Inf) 
        return(hi)
    q <- lo:hi
    d <- dhyper(q, m, n, k) * ncp^(0:(hi - lo))

And I suspect that the test should be ncp^(hi-lo)==Inf.

Seems to work:

> fisher.test(matrix(c(1,20,246,6873),2),hybrid=F)

Interesting. I never thought of the normal generator compensating for
deficiencies in the uniform. Thanks.

Paul

P.S. (Still please add "user-supplied" as an optional normal.kind in 1.1 if
possible. I would like to be able to run my old tests without my library taking
over parts of R base.)

Yes, I have it on the list.  (As you may appreciate, 1.0.0 on 29 Feb is
rather higher up!)  Depending how easy it is, it may make 1.0.x.

Subject: [Rd] bug and fix : using panel.first with plot() in do.call() (PR#457)
Message-ID: <200002251419.PAA13937@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following works as expected
        plot(1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
and if
        my.panel<-function() grid(2,2)
then
        plot(1:5, panel.first=my.panel() )
is also OK

but, 
        do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
        do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel)) 
        do.plot("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel() ))
do not draw the grid because the panel.first expression is evaluated
before the plot gets drawn.


A solution is to modify plot.default such that the line

panel.first
is replaced by

if(is.function(panel.first)) {
        panel.first()
}else {
        panel.first
}
This allows the previous behaviour, but also allows a function name to
be passed to plot using do.call()
now all the following produce the expected graph
plot(1:5, panel.first=grid(2,2))
plot(1:5, panel.first=my.panel())
plot(1:5,panel.first=my.panel)

do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=my.panel ))

Similarly the line 

panel.last 
should be replaced by 
if(is.function(panel.last)) {
        panel.last()
} else {
panel.last
}

As far as I am aware this affects all recent versions.
Cheers, Colin.

Yes, and a solution is

         do.call("plot", list(x=1:5, panel.first=quote(grid(2,2))))

as when you do this sort of thing you can't rely on lazy evaluation.
replacing `quote' by `delay' will also work.  The help page says
they should be unevaluated expressions.

Um, ?plot.default say panel.first and panel.last should be *expressions*
*to be evaluated*, so is this not working as documented?

Subject: [Rd] lambda==0 in dpois() (PR#459)
Message-ID: <200002251927.UAA16322@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  The nice new log=TRUE option in dpois appears to mess up the
case where lambda=0 (I was trying to calculate the likelihood
of a saturated model).  Because the behavior is now always to
calculate the probability in terms of exp(log(prob)), there's
a test for lambda<=0 which really needs to be only lambda<0.

  dpois(0:5,0)

ought to give

 1 0 0 0 0 

but gives NaNs instead.

  Here's a patch to src/nmath/dpois.c that appears to work (although it could ? be more
elegant).

Thanks. We may just be able to squeeze that one in before 1.0.0. But
shouldn't it return -Inf  (ML_NEGINF) for the log case rather than NaN?

  I think you're right.
  By the way, it looks like qpois() may be subject to a similar problem,
although I haven't dug in.  Don't know about any of the other
distributions (dbinom() looks OK).

But... if I does work if I do the following

dataset$MACDfast <- dataset$ema26 - dataset$ema12
dataset$MACDslow <- EMA(dataset$MACDfast,9)
dataset$MACDhist <- dataset$MACDfast - dataset$MACDslow

Something seems wrong if you have an underscore in the dataname.  I think
this is a valid name and shouldnt need to be escaped inside of "".

No, it's not a valid name. The underscore is a synonym for the assignment
operator <-, and so needs to be quoted if you use it. 

If you think this is horrible you're quite right, but the S language
allows _ for <- and many people are used to it.

The commonest S usage is MACD.fast, though some people use capital letters
for embedded words -- MACDFast. Both are used in the base R package:
as.vector(), getOption().

Subject: [Rd] Installation of rpm file on Suse Linux 6.2 (PR#449)
Message-ID: <200002171736.SAA03617@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Luzi P. Schucan
Version: R-base-0.90.1-2.i386.rpm
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (141.84.136.129)


I just wanted to install the rpm package with rpm --v -i [file], and here is the
log:
(I DID run it as root!!)
(the important thing is in the end: there must be a bug in the post install
script.
The problem is, that it does install all the files, but it doesn't correctly
hang
the whole thing into the system. No binaries can be run, it always says things
about
missing links etc)
(I'd be VERY glad if you could help me FAST, 'cause this is for my Diplomarbeit
at 
the ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Thank you!)

The problem was that someone thought the \name field in .Rd files gave the
file name: it does not.  This has been fixed for a while, and will
appear fixed in 1.0.0 tomorrow.

You'd have a better chance of getting people to help if you didn't
overload their mailboxes with 3000+ lines of trace output!

I don't know much about the SuSE RPMs, but it would seem that they
expect to find e.g. the FAQ in info format and it isn't there. If
you're in a hurry, I suggest you build from sources.

The part of the install script that fails is not important:
test -d /usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1 && \
  ln -sf /usr/local/lib/R/doc /usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1/R-docs

(/usr/doc/packages/R-base-0.90.1 does not exist but
 /usr/doc/packages/R-base does)

I should remove it from the postinstall script anyway, sorry.

But R should already run on your machine. Does your PATH variable contain
/usr/local/bin ? What happens if you start /usr/local/bin/R ?  I guess you
tried to run /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R directly. This fails because it
contains the path where this R rpm was built. I will clean up this in
future rpms (allready done in R-base-0.99.1a-1.rpm for SuSE 6.3) but if
you use /usr/local/bin/R everything should work, also in this SuSE 6.2
rpm.

I checked the installation with R-base-0.90.1-2.i386.rpm from

   ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pubR/bin/linux/suse/6.2/RPMS/i386/base

on a SuSE 6.2 machine just now, complaint about "execution of script
failed" occurs, but R runs.

BTW, you should consider waiting for version 1.0.0 which arrives soon
(give me also a little bit time to recompile all the rpm packages then)



Best whishes 

Albrecht

etc/colors.big doesn't do the job currently, as:

  colors.big maps 455 names to rgb in S syntax
  rgb.txt maps 657 names to rgb in C syntax, but unlike colors() it has
mixed upper and lower case

The C source has the information twice
  rgb.c maps 657 names to rgb (mixed upper and lower case)
  graphics.c maps 657 names tp colorstrings (lower case only)

internal name2col() and R colors() accesses those in graphics.c

I tend to create a R representation which copies the info from graphics.c,
unless someone plans to export
internal name2col() to become an official R function, which of course would
be a less redundant solution.

Regards


Jens

There seems to be a problem in 0.99.0a with the normal kind being reset:

Subject: [Rd] Cleaning up in the bugs repository
Message-ID: <x2aekl6xhr.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


In order not to have more items in the BUGS list than necessary, I've
gone through the list of open bugs and removed some of them for
reasons given below:

(Note that nothing really dies on R-bugs it just moves into trashcan,
wishlist, or Something-fixed, so if you complain loudly enough they
can be picked up again.)

*Graphics*

Remove three reports on panel.first() (2 + 1 answer with a different
number) because one really cannot expect to do what they were trying
to do. We may still want to use eval(panel.first) in plot.default,
though. 

*Low-level*

Jens O-A's:
"as.matrix.data.frame() modifies content of character columns"

was moved to Documentation-fixed. The behaviour is Splus compatible,
so hardly fixable.

*System-specific*

SuSE RPM (non-)issue got cleared up by Albrecht earlier today, I
believe. -->trashcan

*TooMuchAtOnce*

Two very old reports by Jim Lindsey and Rashid Nassar --> trashcan
(because, as the title implies, they are very long and most of the
items have been fixed or gone out of date). Please resubmit (in
smaller pieces!) if you still think there are bugs.

this is shocking bad news, as it means, that we stay with a severe bug, be
it in S+ or not.
It means, we can't be shure, that the CONTENT of a character data remains
unchanged, if we rearange the data.

x1 <- '"'
x2 <- data.frame(I(x1))
x3 <- as.matrix(x2)

> x1
[1] "\""
> x2[1,1]
[1] "\""
> x3[1,1]
[1] "\\\""


I came across this, when I tried to write a function, which exports R data
reliably to flatfiles. Of course I used as.matrix.data.frame as it is a
basic function, but

IF this bug remains in R, there can just be one consequence: NEVER use
as.matrix, at least with character data AND REMEMBER not to use it.

Very unhappy about this

- sorry the previous mail went out by accidentaly hitting a key, here is the
end -

.. please rethink, if there is any way to get that fixed. I mean, do we
really have to expect S+ code to break, because it relies on this bug?

  [ Sent to R-devel instead of R-help ]

  I wrote the following hacks recently, which might be useful to those on
a Unix system (with tr, sed, uniq, and the color list living in
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt): I think that along with palette(), rgb() this
provides most of the functionality for translating among

color numbers
color names
rgb vectors
colors as specified by topo.color() etc. (hex strings)

(I didn't write an rgb vector -> color name translator, would be easy but
seems less useful than the other translations.) Of course, it would be
nice to see these built in instead of hacked.  They could probably even be
hacked better.

system("tr A-Z a-z </usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt | sed -e 's/\\([a-zA-Z]\\) \\([a-zA-Z]\\)/\\1\\2/g' | uniq >colors.tmp")
color.list <- read.table("colors.tmp",skip=1,as.is=TRUE)
names(color.list) <- c("red","green","blue","name")

colorname.to.rgb <- function(name) {
  color.list[pmatch(name,color.list[,"name"]),1:3]
}
  
color.to.rgb <- function(color) {
#  given color as hexadecimal, return RGB values
  hexvec <- c(0:9,"A","B","C","D","E","F")
  rgb <- numeric(3)
  names(rgb) <- c("red","blue","green")
  for (i in (0:2)) {
    h1 <- which(hexvec==substr(color,i*2+2,i*2+2))-1
    h2 <- which(hexvec==substr(color,i*2+3,i*2+3))-1
    rgb[i+1] <- h1*16+h2
  }
  rgb
}

Date: Mon, 28 Feb 2000 21:43:02 -0500 (EST)

I've discovered Ripley's relevel function, but I'm still wondering
what people might think of the idea of rewriting read.table to have a
data.order argument that would order the levels of factors according
to the order that they appear in the data file.  Thus if data.order
was TRUE and if "Yes" appeared before "No" in a particular column of
the data file, then levels() would return "Yes" "No" for the
corresponding factor, instead of the default alphabetical "No" "Yes".

Note that the flavor of what I want is similar to the functionality of
relevel, and in particular I do not want to make the factors into
ordered factors.

I have put together a quick and dirty function to do this (ignoring
what might happen with NA's), but it seems to me that it might be a
nice option for read.table so I thought I'd suggest it.

This is still in 1.0.0;
I will fix it for the next "patch release".

Thank you for your kind words, but Linux binaries are actually made by
people outside the core team. Albrecht Gebhardt does the SuSE ones,
but I wouldn't know whether he intends to make a version for 6.2
(0.99.0a was 6.3 only).

Here's the output in readable form. The bug seems to be that
count.fields() thinks the records are the same length but read.table
doesn't.

Ok. read.table and count.fields don't have identical defaults.

R> args(count.fields)
function (file, sep = "", quote = "", skip = 0)

R> args(read.table)
function (file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'", dec = ".",
    row.names, col.names, as.is = FALSE, na.strings = "NA", skip = 0)


So if count.fields likes your data but read.table doesn't, you probably
want

 read.table("Consult/krasdata",sep="\t",quote="")


Please don't use Base64 encoding in attached files -- it was quite hard to
find a program to decode it, and it's really intended for sending binary
files.  Use plain text, and if your mailer insists on encoding attachments
then just cut and paste the output into the message.

read.data and count.fields have different defaults for the quote=
argument (which is arguably a bug). Try read.table(...,quote="") if
the data contain quote marks (single or double).
