The help page is correct: please read it more carefully:

     `gc' returns a matrix with rows `"Ncells"' (cons cells, usually 28
     bytes each on 32-bit systems and 56 bytes on 64-bit systems, and
     `"Vcells"' (vector cells, 8 bytes each), and columns `"used"' and
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    `"gc trigger"', each also interpreted in megabytes (rounded up to
     the next 0.1Mb).

`30158416 bytes' is your invention: gc() actually reports `30158416
Vcells'.

It *is* matrix as stated, and not a list!

This looks like a problem with package dependencies.  Should be sending this to
the 
package author, not r-bugs?


An attempt to install lattice from the windows binary runs OK, but attempting to
load the library an error occurs:

> install.packages("D:/Software/R/lattice.zip", .lib.loc[1], CRAN = NULL)
updating HTML package descriptions
> library(lattice)
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : syntax error on line 2022

I then tried installing under linux with R 1.5.1

This installed OK, but loading the library gave another error:

> library(lattice)
Error in library(grid) : There is no package called `grid'

Installing grid on linux resulted in lattice loading and working properly

Installing grid also fixed the problem on windows.

It *is* package dependency, exactly.  lattice is wholly dependent upon grid,
so, in short,
no grid, no lattice.  On windows, I believe the installation of binary
packages simply unzip the package zip file(s) to the appropriate folder.  No
checks for dependency until loading time.

To R-devel:  Can package dependencies be checked at installed time, at least
for source packages?

Note the R version (1.3).

grid and lattice have been part of the Windows binary distribution since
1.4.0.  grid depends critically on the R version, so don't change it
unless you know exactly what you are doing.

library() in  1.6.0 will do a lot more checks of the package to be loaded.

Nope.  What packages are available depends on the current .libPaths(),
hence can only be known at load time.  There has been a long-term plan
that installing a package would also install its dependencies, but
the dynamic nature of R libraries (the dirs in which packages are
installed) makes this tricky.

Full_Name: Linc Davis
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Mac OS 10.1.5
Submission from: (NULL) (68.4.90.94)


When running install.packages("Rwave") as root, I got this error:

In file included from compinteg.c:12:
kernel.h:22: malloc.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [compinteg.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'Rwave'

There are 3 header files 'malloc.h' in Mac OS X: one for generic C, one for
Objective-C, and a private one for the OS. The R installation script looks for C
headers in /usr/include, but the actual path to this one is

/usr/include/sys/malloc.h

I worked around the problem by copying the file as indicated, then I deleted the
copy after compiling the package. To fix the bug, the script should be changed
to look for C headers in both /usr/include and /usr/include/sys.

Thanks.

Subject: matrices and arrays loose dimension after multiplying with scalar (PR#1979)
Message-ID: <200209031545.RAA14954@pubhealth.ku.dk>

A matrix or array with one of its dimensions having zero elements looses its
dimension after multiplying with scalar.
Admittedly this is an extreme case, however it DOES make sense to retain an
objects formal structure after multiplying with a scalar, as e.g. a matrix
with zero rows IS a legal object in S. BTW, the prototype does retain the
dimension.

Danke, Jens!

o still happens in R-devel (aka 1.6.0 "unstable") of today.

o yes, it's a bug  though not a high-priority one {and we are
  approaching deep feature freeze real soon now...}

Subject: FIX for old and new problems with order(): order fails with na.last=NA (PR#1981)
Message-ID: <200209031913.VAA15648@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I recently reported order() to ignore decreasing=TRUE with na.last=NA.
Now I discovered two other problems and send corrected code.

Best regards

# PROBLEM 1 see PR#1906


# PROBLEM 2
> order(1, na.last=NA)
Error in apply(sapply(z, is.na), 1, any) :

# PROBLEM 3
> order(c(NA, NA), na.last=NA)
Error in order(c(NA, NA), na.last = NA) : all elements contain an NA
# The help file promises ordering indices to all non-NA elements. 
# Thus, if all elements are NA, consequently the result should be integer(0)
# The prototype also returns integer(0) and additionally gives a warning
from sort.list()


# Here are fixes for all three problems

# save old version for comparision below
old.order <- order  


order <- function (..., na.last = TRUE, decreasing = FALSE)

    if (!is.na(na.last)) 
        .Internal(order(na.last, decreasing, ...))

        z <- list(...)
        if (any(diff(sapply(z, length)) != 0)) 
            stop("Argument lengths differ")
        ok <- !apply(matrix(sapply(z, is.na), nrow=length(z[[1]]),
ncol=length(z)), 1, any)  # make shure the result of sapply is a matrix
        if (all(!ok)){
            # stop("all elements contain an NA")	# don't turn all-NA into a
stop error
            return(integer(0))				# don't turn all-NA into a stop error

Message-ID: <3D77613F.31B79516@bank-banque-canada.ca>

Extending a recent R help discussion:

 [1] 50  1
# this implies 50 periods of data
> dim(t(xmat2))

# this implies 2 periods of data on 50 series

(In R 1.5.1 on Solaris.) I think this should be considered a bug in t(),
which probably should not preserve ts attributes. I will file it as a
bug unless there are other opinions. I guess there are other
possibilities (such as, the documentation for the structure of a ts
should be changed), but I think t() preserving the mts and ts class and
attributes will probably break lots of other things.

Hi,

 I am not sure if this is a bug in layout or I am doing something silly.
 If it is a bug I will file a proper report.

here goes:

plot.new()
old.pars<-par()

 #try to divide the device into a big and small component
 layout(matrix(c(1,2),1,2),widths=c(lcm((old.pars$pin[1]-1)*2.2),lcm(2.2)))
 lay.pars<-par()
 names(old.pars)[!old.pars%in%lay.pars]
 [1] "cxy"   "fig"   "mfcol" "mfg"   "mfrow" "pin"   "plt"
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] -0.2828187  5.2876886
 #Huh? should this be negative?
 dev.off()
 plot.new()
 layout(matrix(c(1,2),1,2),widths=c(5,1))
 lay.pars<-par()
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] 0.01610944 5.28768865
 plot.new()
 lay.pars<-par()
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] 4.676389 5.287689
 Reverse of what I would have thought.
 
 Thanks

Because the "current plot" at this point is the second (narrower) plot
(see below), which does not actually have room for a plot (the margins
are wider than the total width allocated so the plot region is
negative).  If at this point you type "plot.new()" twice, the second
call will give an error complaining about margins being too big.

R keeps an index of which plot it is up to.  The index runs from 1 to
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.  Whenever plot.new() is called,
this index is incremented by 1 and it wraps back to 1 when it exceeds
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.

When you call layout() it sets the "current" plot region to be
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.  Note that the first thing that
must happen before any drawing can occur is a call to plot.new().  Then
when you call plot.new() it tries to go to the "next plot" which adds 1
to the "current plot" counter, which wraps back around to 1.  

I think what is causing most confusion here is the fact that the call to
layout() is setting things up ready for the next call to plot.new(),
which in turn sets everything up ready for the actual graphical output
to occur (via axes(), lines(), ...).

The short answer:  no it is not a bug :)

Hope that helps.

Subject: explict sharing of symbols between packages
Message-ID: <3D786605.92B582FE@csiro.au>

Hi everyone,

I'm thinking about breaking up a large package I have to
avoid loading some of the more specialised parts when it
isn't necessary.

The package is dependent on shared libraries. The base one
will keep all of the core stuff like constructors etc and
the specialised parts will need to access these. It is
obviously possible to set the "local" flag to false, however
this becomes a dangerous, especially with the larger
package.

Is there any way to define a group of packages that share a
symbol table? That would seem to me to be a possible
solution.

Can anyone offer advice on this?

Thanks

Are you talking about the R symbol table, or the symbol table in the
dynamically linked libraries? 

If the former, then (until namespaces are implemented) they *always*
share symbol tables.  Every routine can see every other routine.

Your comment about a "local" flag makes me think you're talking about
an external library.  This may be system dependent.  In Windows it's
not possible to do what you want to do.  A DLL exports certain
symbols, and there's no way to merge that table with the table from
another DLL.  However, it is normal to import routines specifying both
the routine name and which DLL they come from, so name clashes don't
need to be a problem.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

I have partially fixed this bug. Now arithmetic works fine but I still

[1] "2002-06-01 06:15:01"
 > b=c(a)
 > b
[1] "2002-06-01 05:15:01"

TZ is set to +0100 dy default on the Carbon R.

Hi,
I think I am beginning to understand how this works, but obviously not
fully. layout changes the following pars
[1] "cxy"  "fig"  "fin"  "mfg"  "pin"  "plt"  "usr"  "xaxp" "yaxp"

and as you state below moves the counter to N so after layout is called
if par is called one gets the pars for the Nth plot. Now after a call to
plot.new() the counter is set to 1 and a call to par gets the pars() for
the current plot.

what if I have a call to layout in a function, and i want to alter the
parameter "pin" in the first plot? Advancing through using plot.new()
does not seem to work because pin gets set each time the frame advances.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Nicholas

Did you run tools/rsync-recommended? (See

(Vince, I'd appreciate a slightly longer fuse before having *changes*
in the build procedure for the development version show up on the
public bug lists. You might have asked R-core.)

Subject: explict sharing of symbols between packages
In-Reply-To: <3D786605.92B582FE@csiro.au>; from Richard.Beare@csiro.au on Fri, Sep 06, 2002 at 06:23:33PM +1000

Hi Richard.

 This issue arises reasonably often. Doug Bates has brought it up on a
few occassions, specifically related to packages that want to use
routines that are located in R modules (lapack). And many of the
Omegahat packages are naturally split into different packages that
share a set of common routines. 

As you point out, you can use 
   dyn.load("foo.so", local = FALSE)
to get the symbols in foo.so directly into 
the global symbol table and make them available
to other dynamically loaded code.
This can introduce a whole range of other problems

There are a few different approaches you can use.

a) Put the common code into a native library (e.g. libCommon.a or libCommon.so)
 and then arrange to have each of the packages that use these routines
 link against this. For Windows, you will explicitly export the symbols
 that are to be shared from this library.

 In this model, the library of common routines (libCommon.so) is not
 used dynamically loaded by R. Instead is one step removed, being
 linked into .so's or .dll's that are.

 This is probably the most practical approach. However, it will require
 that you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or PATH on Windows) variable
 to include the directory containing libCommon.so/dll so that the dynamic loader
 can find it at run time.

 Also, if you use global variables in the common library, some systems
 require coaxing to ensure that there is only one instance of those variables
 shared across all the different libraries.


b) If you really want to have 



I have some example packages that illustrate this.  If there is
interest, I will tidy them up and write up a more complete description
of the different approaches.

Kurt Hornik and I have agreed to implement a mechanism after R 1.6 is
released.  It will probably use one or more of these approaches and
make them much easier.

Oops. Thought I was postponing that mail and sent it instead.
So here is the alternative approach, i.e. b)

Rather than use the linker to connect the calls to the common routines
and their definitions in a secondary library (e.g. libCommon.so), you
can resolve and set the symbols yourself.  Specifically, you use
function pointers in the code that calls the shared routines and then
when you load the packages, you arrange to have these variables refer
to the actual routines that you want.

For example, suppose we have two packages - A and B and A has a
routine named foo() that we want to call in the routine bar() located
in B.

So A.c has
void
foo(void)  {
  ...
}

And B.c has

void (*foo_ptr)(void);

void 
bar()
{
  /* Want to call bar() */
 (*foo_ptr)();
}

Given this setup, you need to have an initialization
routine in B.c that sets the value of the variable foo_ptr.
There are two ways to do this.
You can call R_FindSymbol() within C code.

Using the initialization routine in package B
void R_init_B(DllInfo *dll)
{
   foo_ptr = R_FindSymbol("foo", "A", NULL);
}


Alternatively, you can do the lookup in R and pass
the address of foo() as an argument to a routine in B.

a <- getNativeSymbolInfo("foo", PACKAGE = "A")
.Call("setFoo", a,  PACKAGE = "B")

And the C routine setFoo()  looks something like

SEXP setFoo(SEXP address)
{
  foo_ptr = R_ExternalPtrAddr(address);
  return(R_NilValue);
}


This approach, compared to linking libraries, allows you to
dynamically change routines. This can be useful but is probably
overkill for your example. However, this approach does not rely 
on linkers idiosyncrasies.

 Hope this helps.

  D.

Subject: No reorder.factor in R
Message-ID: <C71CB7425639D311A7A40008C7286AB006A54FBF@carina.phibred.com>


I was using R 1.5.1 today with an old script from S-Plus and discovered that
R does not have reorder.factor.  

It's a very simple function, but very handy for re-arranging factors in
lattice graphics (among other places).  Would it make sense to add this
function to the base code
in order to increase compatability with S-Plus and add additional
functionality?

reorder.factor <- function(fac, y, fun=mean, ...){
  ordered(fac, levels=levels(fac)[order(tapply(y, fac, fun, ...))])
}

reorder.factor is part of Trellis and I believe little used elsewhere.
That makes it a prime candidate for lattice.

I always thought it should be called `order.factor' as factors are not
normally ordered (although Trellis assumes they are).

Forwarded to r-devel since it is a slight change of topic

 - it seems that it might be worth considering putting two special
 variables into the lapply/sapply environment,
   .currentIndex and .currentTag 

  - these are both hard to get right now, and the solutions that
 people are finding, seem to depend on the order in which the lapply
 is applied (that might change -- also, if we get some form of
 parallelism going this solution should be nicer).

Use

lapply(seq(along=lst).  function(i, vec, lst){body}, vec=vec, lst=lst)

using the index i in the body.

Or just use a for loop.

Subject: R 1.6.0 beta
Message-ID: <x2ptvlub4i.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>

R 1.6.0 has gone into final feature freeze as of today.

As a new feature, we'll make interim beta versions available via

ftp://cran.us.r-project.org/pub/R/src/base

alias 

http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base

(filename R-1.6.0beta_*.tar.gz, where * is the creation date). 

If you want to help ensure that the final 1.6.0 works satisfactorily
on *your* platform, it might be a good idea to make a test build of
the beta and report any errors back. 

The plan is to make versions daily, although some days might be
skipped if the build script fails.

We now bundle the recommended packages with the base sources.

--------------
The procedure for building and testing everything can be as simple as
 
<unpack sources> 
cd R-1.6.0 
./configure && make && make fullcheck 

(Make fullcheck can take a long time, especially in the boot and nlme
packages).

The current version in known to pass the checks for our Linux/x86
systems but has two known problems on Solaris/gcc: An optimizer bug in
gcc 3.0.3 causing "cluster" to fail in mona.f and a convergence issue
with the glns example in nlme.

Subject: Old-style classes: bug fix & request
Message-ID: <3D7E13E5.2002332@research.bell-labs.com>

Bug fix:

A bug introduced in version 1.6 failed to "initialize" some old-style
(aka "S3") classes, producing possible warning messages if those classes
were used in the signature of a method in the methods package.

The real bug, though, was that old-style inheritance could not be
included, until the setOldClass function was provided.  Initializing the
methods package now defines a number of old-style classes, some with
inheritance.

The bug & its fix are only relevant if you want to use old-style classes
in defining formal methods.

Request:

The request is for input on other classes that need to be included or
currently included classes not treated correctly.

Roughly, if there is an assignment of class in the base package that
does not break the consistency of classes, we should initialize that
class or classes via a call to setOldClass.  The discussion in
"Programming with Data", pp 449-451 covers some of the issues.

The list of old-style classes processed is in .OldClassesList in the
methods package.  Elements of the list are character vectors; each is
used in a call to setOldClass during initialization.  So elements of the
list with > 1 string define old-style inheritance.

There are a few known classes in the base package NOT currently
initialized:

- "noquote": The use of the "noquote" class breaks the class model
because it inserts a class name _after_ an arbitrary other class name,
changing the hierarchy from one object to another.  Can't be
consistently used in setOldClass.

- "listof" and "list.of".  It wasn't clear whether these are different
and if so, whether both should be included.

Ideally, we would like the call to setOldClass to be associated with the
package that uses the S3 class, but to do so requires using the methods
package in initializing the other package.

For the moment, the proposal is to handle in the methods package the
old-style classes in the base package.  For other packages, we need a
different solution.

Keeping with the practice of the last two full releases, I took the 20020910 
tarball, and the rec'ed packages, last night and made Debian packages for the
unstable distribution.  I intend to update these weekly before Oct. 1 to ensure
that they do not migrate into testing yet as Debian's unstable is the appropriate
environment for these packages.

The build daemons have already caught up. The page
   http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=r-base
has links to the full build logs on all arches.  As of right now, we already 
have  
   alpha, arm hppa, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, sparc, s390
With the exception of arm, all run (and pass) "make check". Arm has a long-
standing fpu bug which is triggered by one test.

I made a small blunder. I had previously used a naming scheme like e.g.
1.4.1.cvsYYYYMMDD for the 1.5.0 pre-release.  This time I wanted to signal the
1.6.0 nature of the release and picked 1.6.0.rc.20020910  -- but that sorts 
higher than 1.6.0, so I will need to use 1.6.0.rel or 1.6.0.release on October 1.
I hope you're not to offended by this deviation from the simpler "1.6.0" .

Subject: setGeneric(); R CMD check
Message-ID: <20020910150946.B2319@jessie.research.bell-labs.com>

1. Is it always the case that when defining generic functions in
   a package, the package needs to be installed as a binary package
   to avoid having the generic functions in the .GlobalEnv?

2. Defining a generic function in a "non-binary" package triggers 
   a check warning

     $ R CMD check ...
     ...
     * checking for code/documentation mismatches ... WARNING
     Objects with usage in documentation object 'dbApply' but missing from code:
     [1] "dbApply"

   It seems that the generic function dbApply lives in the .GlobalEnv when
   the package is attached (w. library), but not in the package's environment.
   I presume that's why check triggers the warning.

   Is this the case?

*If* this is the case (i.e., packages with setGeneric()s need to be installed
as binaries), perhaps it should be documented somewhere.

... or am I missing something very basic?

I just downloaded R-1.6.0beta_2002-09-10.tar.gz and configured on:

uname -m = sun4u
uname -r = 5.8
uname -s = SunOS
uname -v = Generic_108528-12

resulting in (did not change any defaults):

   Source directory:          .

where gcc is version 2.95.3 (f77 is version 0.5.25).  It compiles fine, 
but make fullcheck stops at:

There is no survival-Ex.R file in ./tests/Examples !!!  The survival

Hmm? Which "make" are you using? It's not supposed to start processing
recommended packages until after all the base ones and the specific
tests.

One should be made as part of the make process.


One thing that doesn't quite look right in the Makefile is the

Makedeps: Makefile
        @(for p in $(R_PKGS_BASE); do \
            dep="$${p}-Ex.Rout: $${p}-Ex.R"; \
            dep="$${dep} \$$(top_builddir)/library/$${p}/R/$${p}"; \
            tmp="library/$${p}/libs/$${p}" ; \

Maybe that should be 

        @(for p in $(R_PKGS_BASE) $(R_PKGS_RECOMMENDED_EXPANDED); do \
        <...etc...>

Could you try and see if it helps?

I have successfully compiled it under Windows XP.

Though, as a side track.  I compiled it under Inno Setup 3.0.3-beta.  In the
3.x version, "AlwaysCreateUninstallIcon" is no longer supported.  I had to
deleted the line (Line 12, I believe), added :
    Name: "{group}\R 1.6.0 beta"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"
into the [Icons] block..  I think one can compile without adding in this
line, but the "AlwaysCreateUninstallIcon" must be removed.  (I know this
version of Inno Setup is still at beta stage, but it seems this "feature" is
going to stay :-)).

The resulting installation file, rw1060.exe, is roughly 16.3MB, without
compiled HTML support (I didn't built it).

Thought this may interest some people :-)

Subject: vecLib
Message-ID: <084F0DE2-C548-11D6-8A95-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

Mac OS X 10.2 comes with /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework,
which contains Altivec optimized versions of LAPACK, BLAS (and of
libraries for Digital Signal Processing and BigNums, and a vector
version of the scalar libm). All this is either 8, 16, or 32 bit signed  
and
unsigned integers, or single precision IEEE floating point.

Browse it:   <developer.apple.com/hardware/ve>

Code it:      /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/

Include it:  #include   <vecLib/vecLib.h>

Do it:         cc -faltivec -framework vecLib file.c

Although the use of single precision FP may be a problem for
building all of R, this framework could obviously be used to build
some wickedly fast DSP and linear algebra packages.

You might be a bit alone there, but on the other hand, cygwin and the
autotools are meant to play nicely with each other, so what happens if
you just try? I'd expect that you'll get a few hiccups from things
like #ifdef Win32 implying !Unix but most should compile cleanly. (I
believe I had configure+make working under Cygwin about 4 or 5 years
ago (no X11, obviously), but "lots of water has been passed under the
bridge" since then).

Actually it's not even true for Solaris. I got a sense of deja vu,
looked through my install logs, and found that I had *deleted*
libreadline.so because it conflicted with gcc 3.0.1 when building R
(this was almost exactly a year ago on Sep 10, 2001; the events of the
following day might have dislodged things from my memory!)

That is of course still a possible workaround... 
Or downgrading to gcc 2.95.3, which seems more and more attractive
given all the trouble with gcc 3.x.

I think we'll switch to Inno Setup 3 when it's released.  I'm
especially hoping for the "install from the net" option to be
implemented; that should allow us to include optional TCL/TK
installation, without increasing the size of the distributable by 9
Meg for everyone.

The change you suggested looks like it would be compatible with Inno
2; I'll take a look.

Subject: rhome.c: getRHOME() fails, if R is called from SJava (PR#2003)
Message-ID: <200209111317.PAA14882@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Heinz Grimm
Version: R1.5.1
OS: Windows NT 4.0
Submission from: (NULL) (195.65.178.178)


The R error message is:
"Fatal error: Unable to open base package"

The reason is:
getRHome() returns e.g. d:/r-project/R-1.5.1 if called within R (correct)

getRHome() returns e.g. D:/jdk1.3.1_01/jre if R is called from SJava (0.65),
hence
R tries to load the base library from D:/jdk1.3.1_01/jre/library/base/R/base
(very
bad)

I have modified $R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/rhome.c in this way:

char *getRHOME()
{
    char *RHome;

    RHome = getenv("R_HOME");
    if(!RHome)
    {
      RHome = getenv("RHOME");
    }
    if(!RHome)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "No R_HOME environment variable value\n");fflush(stderr);
      exit(1);
    }
    strcpy( rhomebuf, RHome);
    return (rhomebuf);
}

now it works fine!

By "binary", meaning "INSTALL --save" or equivalent?

Yes, and the symptom you mentioned is rather mild, compared to what will
often happen!  Any of the computations that default to assigning
metadata to the global environment will cause problems (setMethod,
setClass, ...) in a default installation, unless all such computations
are wrapped in a function call that can be re-directed from the
.First.lib function to the correct environment.

It's not likely to be worth the effort.

For the present version of R, the simplest approach is probably for the
programmer to arrange for an installation with a saved image, either
through the option to INSTALL or by putting a file "install.R" (an empty
file will do) in the top source directory of the package.

For the next version, we should try to make the process more automatic,
although the only way that would always work seems to be by making
--save the default to INSTALL.

...................

As mentioned, the "CMD check"  problem may be the least of it!

The following snippet will _apparently_ install with or without --save:

### Dummy Package
require("methods")

foo <- function(x)x

setGeneric("foo")

setMethod("foo", "character", function(x) paste("++", x))
###

But in the default install, it fails (annoyingly) when the library is
attached, because the assignment of foo is not in the search list, so
setGeneric doesn't find any definition of "foo".


R> library(DummyPackage)
Loading required package: methods 
Error in setGeneric("foo") : Must supply a function skeleton, explicitly
or via an existing function


It's possible to work around most of the specific problems, but my
feeling is that the natural semantics for the programmer is that  the
same source code should work basically the same way, whether being
sourced into the global environment for initial testing or being
installed as a package.

> *If* this is the case (i.e., packages with setGeneric()s need to be installed

Yes.  I'll add it to the online help for INSTALL (& the extensions
document?).

By the way, an additional annoyance is that even with --SAVE, this
doesn't quite work always, because the `require("methods")' is only
active at INSTALL time, not when the image is loaded.  It would be nice
to make this carry over automatically as well, but how?

For now, the programmer needs to include the require("methods") in a
First.lib function in the package.

Just to wrap up this thread, for now.

A section has been added to ?INSTALL with hints on installing packages
that use the methods package:

     Packages that require the methods package, and that use functions
     such as `setMethod' or `setClass', should be installed by creating
     a binary image.

     The package should require the methods package, both during
     installation and when the user attaches the package.  A good
     solution for most cases is to include the line
     `require("methods")' twice, once at the beginning of the package's
     R source, and once in the file `install.R' in the package
     directory (the top-level directory, not in the `R' directory below
     that).  The `install.R' file causes an image to be saved, and the
     contents will ensure that methods are available when the package
     is attached.

The suggestions seem to work, at least on some simple tests.  I'm not
aware of situations where this fails, but let me know otherwise.

The documentation should be in the next beta or rsync,  also in the
windows INSTALL help file (but I don't have a way to test that), plus a
pointer in the R-exts document to the online help page.

This doesn't work in the currently released version, because it
doesn't define {uninstallexe}.  I'll leave the install script as is;
once Inno Setup 3 is released, I'll look at the benefits of switching
over to it. Certainly there won't be any change before the 1.6.0
release.

John, 

Thanks for the solution.

Your suggestion seems to work quite nicely and the added paragraphs
to help(INSTALL) are clear.  However, it seems that most people will
not be aware of this issue, and if and when they stumble into it,
looking at ?INSTALL may not be their first thought.  I'm wondering
if it would be helpful to include a similar description (or point to
?INSTALL) in, say, "Writing R Extensions", and/or ?setMethod, etc.?
A line in the Release Notes may also be helpful?

Subject: R 1.6.0 beta
Message-ID: <3D7FA193.5050107@univie.ac.at>

I did a test run of compiling R 1.6.0
I got an error when compiling the recommended packages:

C:\devel\R-1.6.0\src\gnuwin32>make recommended
--- Unpacking recommended packages
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../library/VR/DESCRIPTION'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../library/KernSmooth/DESCRIPTION'. 
  Stop.
......................... some more lines for the other libraries
make: *** [unpack-recommended] Error 2

I noticed that the Makefile in gnuwin32 contains the following lines

../library/%/DESCRIPTION: ../library/RECOMMENDED/%_tgz
	@echo "---- $*"
	(cd ../library; tar zxf Recommended/$*_tgz; touch $@)

but the files in src/library/Recommended
have extensions .tar.gz

is that connected with the problem?

I compiled on win2k

Is this error my fault, did I overlook something?

A confirmation:
Now setting

options(htmlhelp=TRUE,browser="C:\\Program Files\\Internet 
Explorer\\IEXPLORE.EXE")

in etc\Rprofile
also controls which browser is used when help is called from the menu item.

In the tar file all the foo_tgz's are symbolic links to
foo_7.9-13.tar.gz etc. Now, Windows doesn't have symlinks...

You probably have a tar that ignores symbolic links. I believe Brian's 
creates an extra copy of the file. 

The symlinks offered a quick solution to the problem of keeping track
of dependencies on files that change not only their timestamps but
also their name.  (Relevant for the core developers and people who
build from the rsync snapshots.)  I suspect there's a better way, I
just didn't see it before feature freeze...

Subject: Startup/Initialization Memory Leak in R
Message-ID: <5.1.1.5.2.20020911210204.00ac4270@pop.prism.gatech.edu>

    Is it already known that R does not free the memory that it allocates 
during start-up (~10MB) when it exits?  If so, are there currently any 
plans to address this problem?  I noticed that the 1.6.0 beta leaks 
slightly more memory (~300k) than the 1.5.1 stable version.

    I am working on a project that links with the R library, and there is a 
question about unloading and later re-loading the R library, so this memory 
leak could become a real issue.

Thank you.

Hi,

I have updated the chapter on Compile R from Source in my R for Windows
Users guide.  I'm not planning on officially releasing it until R 1.6.0 is
officially released, but if you want a sneak preview of the chapter, you may
get it from http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/pub/R/WinBook/ch4.pdf .
It is targeted at the final official version of R 1.6.0, but should work for
the current beta version too.

A minor point, I just discovered that (while updating the guide) the
R-1.6.0/src/gnuwin32/INSTALL file, Line 56, has a spelling mistake.
prce-3.9.tar.bz2 should be pcre-3.9.tar.bz2 .

Cheers,

Ko-Kang Wang

Subject: gcc and g77 combos

Hi Kurt

I currently have on my Mac gcc 2.95.2, 3.1, and 3.3 and the
corresponding g77 versions as well. R builds fine with
the 2.95.2 combo, it also builds fine with gcc 2.95.2 and
g77 3.1. But using gcc 3.1 or gcc 3.3 gives the familiar
problem that I mentioned before (although the 3.1
combination does build scilab and octave fine).

checking for dummy main to link with Fortran 77 libraries... unknown
configure: error: linking to Fortran libraries from C fails

I include the config.log for the build with gcc 2.95.2 and g77 3.1
(which works) and for the one with gcc 3.1 and g77 3.1, which fails.

Is that configure test, the one that fails, really needed ?

By the way, gcc 3.1 with f2c also works -- but that fails to build
some packages such as splancs and subselect.

More by the way, gcc 3.1 and 2.95.2 come with OS X, g77 3.1
and 2.95.2 come from fink, gcc 3.3 and g77 3.3 come from Apple's
CVS. f2c also from fink.

Subject: R-1.6.0-beta compiling on Solaris with gcc-3.2
Message-ID: <3D80380E.6EDB0682@statistik.uni-dortmund.de>

Compiling R-1.6.0-beta (or any other) with gcc-3.2 just with

 ./configure
 make

 ... works - great!


But there are these annoying warning messages after *each* call to any
of the gcc tools, as in:

I am not really sure if there is something special with our system?
If not, is it possible to solve that in the configure script for a later

Working on a Linux box, I originally found the leak using a memory 
management program that I wrote.  I confirmed the leak using the Valgrind 
program (http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/), which produces a nice 
output.  If you would like, I can post a full or edited output from that 
program.  The majority of the memory is allocated using the GetNewPage 
function in memory.c and appears to still be in the table of allocated 
pages when R exits.

Note that this about initialisation of the R shared library R.so, not the
R executable.

This may need fixing -- with a standalone executable the operating system
will handle memory release when the program exits, but with an R library
dynamically loaded into another process it won't.

OTOH, why do you want to load and unload R lots of times?

I'm a little unclear on what you mean by "when R exits".  R currently
does not have a mechanism for explicitly releasing all its heap
memory.  That is fine when R is run as a process, the original design,
since the OS will release its memory when R exits (normally or
otherwise).  When R is used as a shared library then there is no way
at this point to tell R that you are done with its heap and make sure
it is released. You can build a customized cleanup function and
install it so R_CleanUp calls it, but we currently don't provide a
hook for releasing the heap from that function.  There are other
resources that we do not have convenient means of releasing explicitly
also, such as all loaded shared libraries.  Being able to have
separate R sessions within a single process is something some of us
have talked about and that will require getting a handle on these
issues, but we're not there yet.

process_site_Renviron() doesn't seem to be called anywhere in the
windows sources. Fix:

.../src/gnuwin32/system.c obviously needs (diff'ed to R-1.6.0 beta

In that case we have to change  .../src/unix/sys-common.c  (?) as well,
because R_Home seems to be empty at this point on Windows. I was not
able to figure out why, maybe Duncan has a better solution?

I misunderstood the context.  The same problem would likely occur in
Windows if your application uses R.dll.

I agree that this should be fixed in the long term:  one might want to
instantiate multiple copies of R's evaluator in some application (e.g.
a new front-end that ran multiple consoles), and there should be a way
to shut them down and clean up afterwards.  In the meantime, the
workaround is probably to just keep a list of the activated copies,
and when a new one is needed, check if there's an unused one in the
list.  If so, execute some code to clean up the environment, and
re-use it.

R : Copyright 2002, The R Development Core Team
Version 1.6.0 beta (2002-09-11)

Debian/gcc-3.2

Building and fullchecking caused no errors to talk about, but

$ R CMD check my.package

failed on the example. From my.package-Ex.Rout:
....
Error in match.call(definition, call, expand.dots) :
        NULL is not a logical
Execution halted

This does not happen in 1.5.1, and in 1.6.0, if I install my.package
and run the example, it works fine.

yes.
You are using "T" and "F" in your package instead of "TRUE" and "FALSE".
This is now tested a bit (by setting T <- F <- NULL).

NEWS of "R-1.6.0 beta" 
----		       (probably should be read by ``everyone'')	
has

||     o	R CMD check now tests for mis-use on an installed or binary
|| 	package, and sets 'T' and 'F' to 'NULL' when running the examples.

where I'm pretty sure you won't be the only one..

BTW, (not to Göran, but the publich), also in NEWS

||    o	The assignment operator `_' is deprecated: a warning is	given
||	once per R session.

which really suggests to everyone (you should finally listen ;-) ..
your R code might no longer run in the not so distant future (some time
next year probably) when you'll still be using "_" for assignment

Brian had already raised this some time ago---Brian, is there an obvious
fix?  If not, then we need a configure check for GCC version 3.2 or
better and inititialize CPPFLAGS accordingly?

Subject: [R] proposal: dotchart with xlim
Message-ID: <20020913104711.A2149@s1x.zimnet.ch>

A proposal: dotchart() should accept xlim.

Below my additions and changes (marked with "NEW") to the function.

Subject: [R] proposal: mosaicplot with sub and las
Message-ID: <20020913105944.A2318@s1x.zimnet.ch>


Two proposals for mosaicplot():

- The argument "sub" should not be ignored.
  Example: mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, sub = 'test of sub' )

- To be able to discern also longer axis labels
  the argument "las" or par(las=2) should not be ignored.
  Example: mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, las=2 )

Thanks

You have just to change three lines in mosaicplot.default(). 
Since you provided a very nice suggestion to improve dotchart()
(THANKS!), please, would you provide a suggestion for this one too?

That will be a bit more difficult than just using las, because
annotation is done by text(), not mtext() nor axis(). One have to
calculate with the las values in the srt argument of the text() calls.
I am sure you will provide a suggestion for the improvement soon. [If
you don't get it to work, just send a private e-mail.]

Well, to answer my own question:

You stupidly forgot to get rid of the directory created the day before,
and the date-stamp file is read only so tar cannot overwrite it. You
should know better. Have a good weekend.

Subject: missing data in stripchart (PR#2018)
Message-ID: <200209141735.TAA07686@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jonathan Baron
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (151.201.155.186)


The documentation of stripchart() says that "NA's are allowed in
the data."  I think this would imply that

stripchart(nprob[cancer==4] ~ probtype[cancer==4],meth="stack")

should work even if nprob has a missing datum in the relevant range.
I get the following error message:

Error in xy.coords(x, y) : x and y lengths differ
In addition: Warning message: 
longer object length
is not a multiple of shorter object length in: y + (unlist(xo, use.names =
FALSE) - 1) * offset * csize 

The following works.  There was one missing datum.

stripchart(nprob[cancer==4 & !is.na(nprob)] ~ probtype[cancer==4 &
!is.na(nprob)],meth="stack")

So, either the behavior or the documentation appears to need changing.
I would prefer to change the behavior so it matches the documentation.

In case you want this - and feel free to delete this - here are the
data for the bug I just reported concerning missing data in
stripchart.

You need to run hrp2.R.  Please excuse the extraneous junk.  This was
written mostly by a grad student who was learning R in the process
(Andrea Gurmankin).  She doesn't like to delete things.

Subject: Running Median and Mean
Message-ID: <15749.62506.473601.799299@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

R gurus,

On Aug 20, 2002, I asked in R-help about calculating a running 5-day median on
a large matrix.  Thanks to Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch> and Ray
Brownrigg <Ray.Brownrigg@mcs.vuw.ac.nz> for responding.

I ended up writing C code (and an R interface) to do it, which is about 1000x
faster than the naive method!  (72s became .09s on a 223 x 520 matrix).  I
added a running mean function too, which is very simple and is about 15x
faster than apply(..., filter, ...).  I've packaged the code as
  <http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Devel/runStat_1.1.tar.gz>

The key insight was that it *is* in fact a good idea to calculate the ranks of
the 5 data points, because then it is easy to calculate how those ranks
*change* as you step through the column.  For example, suppose the last few
points in a column look like:
   data=  20 25 18 14 78 55 29
   rank=      3  2  1  5  4
where I have ranked the 5 points prior to the last one.  The median is 25 (the
point with rank 3).  Stepping to the left:
   data=  20 25 18 14 78 55 29
   rank=   3  4  2  1  5
For the 4 points that overlap, their ranks remain the same, except they are
incremented by one for points >=20, and decremented by one for points >55.  The
rank of the new point (20) is just 5 minus the number of increments done.

The code is copied below for your amusement.  Suggestions welcome.  Note I have
not dealt with NA's, even values of N, row-wise medians, or non-lagged medians
(i.e. I put the median of points 1:5 into position 6, not position 5).  It
would be great if somebody (Martin?) wanted to incorporate these functions into
an existing package or even "base"; otherwise I'll post the final product on
CRAN/src/contrib.

I am willing to add these functions into the gregmisc package to complement
the already-existing 'running' function.

{David's a package too}

Note that I said originally,
that I have had code for years (available on request) and
planned to add these to "modreg" (one of the standard packages). 

Further note that I was talking about two algorithms
1) something along the lines David is using,
   where I got the original algorithm from Werner Stuetzle from
   in Fortran (from the 80's).
2) the optimal algorithm of Haerdle & Steiner (and Turlach)
   which can be another order of magnitude faster.

 --> Ref. @article{hae:stei:1995,
       Author = {H\"ardle, W. and Steiger, W.},
       Title = {{O}ptimal Median Smoothing [{Algorithm AS} 296]},
       Year = 1995,
       Journal = {Applied Statistics},
       Volume = 44,
       Pages = {258--264},
   }

I do agree I should have published the code much earlier...

Actually, layout() sets par(pin) only if you have not specified it
deliberately.  For example, the following respects the par(pin) setting
...

par(pin=c(1,1))
layout(matrix(c(1,1,0,2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
plot.new()
plot.window(range(1:10), range(1:10))
points(1:10)
box()

... does that do something like what you want?  (you have to do
something like par(pty="m") if you want to "remove" the par(pin)
setting)

yes.

The following seems a cautious solution:

t.ts <- function(x) {
    cl <- class(x)
    other <- !(cl %in% c("ts","mts"))
    class(x) <- if(any(other)) cl[other]
    attr(x, "tsp") <- NULL

}

It passes "make check" and I plan to commit as bug fix to

Subject: Documentation for passing character NAs to .C
Message-ID: <umgeoucmeciai57h9fb14p9sksaha3atrf@4ax.com>

I can't see any mention in the docs of what happens when a character
string NA is passed to an external function.  What appears to happen
is that it is converted to the two letter string 'NA'; I can't think
of anything better to do, but this should be mentioned somewhere (or
perhaps more prominently).  

The places I thought to look were the .C help file, and section 4.2 of
the Writing Extensions manual.

Full_Name: Ron Wehrens
Version: 1.5.0

Submission from: (NULL) (128.95.17.61)


Consider these two functions:
switchme <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(type,
         E = max(...),
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}
switchme2 <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(type,
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}
The bottom one does what I expect. The top one only gives one answer,
independent 
of the second argument.
> switchme2("V", 1:4)
[1] 4
> switchme2("X", 1:4)
[1] -100
> switchme2("EII", 1:4)
[1] 10
> switchme("V", 1:4)
[1] 24
> switchme("X", 1:4)
[1] 24
> switchme("EII", 1:4)
[1] 24
 
Is there something special about "E"?

Jan,

Thanks for the update, and the additional info.

The test that fails is AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN, one of the standard Autoconf
tests, required in particular to determine the kind of Fortran name
mangling.  So yes, it is necessary.

The failure seems to come from the fact that when trying to determine
the dummy main to link with the Fortran 77 libraries, all efforts fail
along the lines of

configure:14562: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -I/sw/include -I/usr/local/include -L/sw
/lib -L/usr/local/lib conftest.c -lreadline -ldl -lncurses -lm   -lcrtbegin.o -L

Yes. It matches the EXPR arg to switch using partial matching, so the
case selector becomes max(1:4) == 4 and the fourth case is used to gie
prod(1:4) == 24. Not a bug, although perhaps a feature regretted by
the inventor...

The workaround (except for avoiding case labels E, EX, EXP) is 

switchme <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(EXPR=type,
         E = max(...),
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}

Subject: problem with make fullcheck on Sparc Solaris 8
Message-ID: <3D88A9CB.6080105@stat.ohio-state.edu>

I have been trying out R-1.6.0 tarballs (2002-9-10 and 2002-9-17) on:

arch     sparc
os       solaris2.8
system   sparc, solaris2.8
status   beta
major    1
minor    6.0
year     2002
month    09
day      17
language R

As you see form above, R-1.6.0 compiles fine and works.  However, when I 
  "make fullcheck" I get the following error:

running code in 'tools-Ex.R' ... OK
running code in 'ts-Ex.R' ... OK
running code in 'survival-Ex.R' ...bash: survival-Ex.R: No such file or

See the full output from "make fullcheck" at the end of this message.

It seams that the test examples for the recommended packages are never 
created.

I have both used GNU-tools (gmake version 3.79.1) and Solaris tools, but 
with the same results.


Any feedback would be great,
Gardar

I've just had the same problem (with 2002-9-12) on Solaris 2.8 using GNU
tools.

Thanks, but the problem was supposedly fixed by this change

Thu Sep 12 17:15:43 UTC 2002, hornik
  Need 'R_LIBS=' when calling R CMD INSTALL.
  R/src/library/Recommended Makefile.in,1.10

so a build of 2002-9-12 is not very informative.

Could you two please

a) Retry with a clean build (just in case)
b) Tell us whether you have R_LIBS set
c) Tell us whether you build in the source directory or separately
d) Show the output of ls `bin/R RHOME`/library

(should be like this

[pd@butterfly BUILD]$ ls `bin/R RHOME`/library
base     ctest    grid        MASS     mva   R.css    stepfun   ts
boot     e1071    KernSmooth  methods  nlme  rpart    survival
class    eda      lattice     mgcv     nls   spatial  tcltk
cluster  foreign  lqs         modreg   nnet  splines  tools

)

and also check whether survival has the R-ex subdirectory with the
relevant contents.

Here is a test case:

# Some arbitrary data
#
v1<-1:12
v2<-cumsum(v1)
v3<-cumsum(v2)
f<-factor(rep(c("a","b","c"),4))
y<-c(1,4,2,7,5,8,7,9,6,10,12,10)
print(cbind(y,f,v1,v2,v3))
#
# Fit a regression model with no intercept, and different slopes
# for each value of the factor
#
ans<-lm( y ~ -1 + v1/f + v2/f + v3/f, contrasts=list(f=contr.sum))
print(as.matrix(ans$coefficients))

And its output:

> # Some arbitrary data

f2:v2  0.0328886311
f1:v3  0.0414907636
f2:v3  0.0003204578

Though I asked for "sum" contrasts, the v1 coefficients came back
with "treatment" contrasts.  I don't see any technical reason why
"sum" contrasts can't be computed.  Is it a bug?

Also, why should the order of the variables be reversed (f1:v2 where
I would have expected v2:f1, etc.)?

By the way, S-plus refuses to fit this model at all ("Problem in
model.matrix.default(Terms, m, contrasts): Internal error: predicted 2
columns for f %in% v1, got 3).

I've compiled again from the 17th September's source.  I've compiled it
with CHTML support (if anyone need it...).

It's at http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/rinfo.php and has about
20MB in size.

Dear R-Gang -
	Two questions for you:
	1)  I cannot figure out how to sort one column in an array, 
and drag the rest of the values that occupy the other columns along 
with the sorted values in the first column.  What I would like to end 
up with is an array that is the same size and dimensions as the first 
array.  When I try various configurations of sort, I keep getting 
vectors instead of the array I started with, and I have not found a 
way to make sort "bind" other values to the sorted values.
	2)  I used a PC version of R over the summer, and was able to 
use rowSum, colSum and similar functions.  These (and other things) 
do not seem to be enabled on the Mac OS9 version.  Are they enabled 
on the OS10 version?  If not, how can I enable them?  And how do I 
download the OS10 version?  My computer does not recognize the .gz 
files on the website http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/atlas/.
	Many thanks,
	Chris Wills

Do this:

	# example data matrix
	datamat <- matrix(rnorm(1000),ncol=20)

	ord <- order(x[,1])
	sortmat <- datamat[ord,]

Versions of R with the same version number generally doe the same
thing on all platforms, so you must have been using an older one.

I believe the one you want is this file

Subject: savehistory directories and quitting R (PR#2038)

######################################################

Because I work in different directories, but always want to save my
.Rhistory in the same place, I have changed the system function savehistory
to this:

function (file = "D:/R50/.Rhistory") 
invisible(.Internal(savehistory(file)))

When I use q() to quit R, and it asks me whether I want to "save current
workspace", a response of YES means that the .Rhistory is saved in the
current working directory, rather than D:/R50/.Rhistory. I take this to mean
that the quit-on-prompt sequence makes a direct call to .Internal(
savehistory...) rather than going via the actual savehistory() function. It
would be nicer if prompt-on-quit would honour the user's definition of
savehistory.

(Responding NO to the "save current..." prompt means that .Rhistory isn't
saved at all, which is reasonable.)

I admit that this is a very minor bug, because I can set .Last to call
savehistory directly. But I just thought you should know...

cheers
Mark

What happens on shutdown is specific to the platform you're working
on, but in both Windows and Unix versions, the filename is taken from
the R_HISTFILE environment variable.  I don't know if this works on
the Mac.

This would be more obvious if the R savehistory() function were
changed to check the R_HISTFILE environment variable too.

The problem with using the user's savehistory() function is that this
violates the idea of namespaces that we're working towards:  users
should be able to create their own function named "savehistory"
without worrying about changing important internal behaviour.

I get the same error with  R_LIBS not set, R_LIBS set to an empty
string, or set to my default location for libraries.

configure, make, and make fullcheck were done in the top level directory

I will be building and distributing the final release.  Kevin Wang has
been building snapshots and posting them at

 <http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/rinfo.php>

Since I'm going to be out of town from Sept 25 to Oct 1, and I'm busy
preparing for that trip, I haven't been posting snapshots.  If there's
a demand for them and Kevin has to stop, I could do so up to the 25th,
but not easily after that.

The final release will be posted in the usual place on CRAN.  It will
be called rw1060.exe rather than SetupR.exe, and the rw1060??.zip
files will no longer be posted.  The miniR files (which each fit on a
diskette) will be named as before, miniR.exe and miniR-1.bin up to
miniR-7.bin.

Subject: install.packages() together with pixmap package (PR#2042)
Message-ID: <200209191626.SAA21853@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Wolfgang Huber

OS: Windoof 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (193.174.62.11)


Hi,

Trying to install the binary distribution (zip file) for the "pixmap" package,
as downloaded today from CRAN, I get the following warning "error -1". The
package will not be installed. 
Installation of other packages (e.g. pinktoe, acepack) worked fine. The warning
or error seems to be thrown by .Internal(int.unzip).

I also tried with an external unzip programm, setting: options(unzip="pkunzip").
This eliminates the error message, and install.packages() terminates quietly
without warnings, however also without installing anything (for all of the above
packages).

So, possibly the package pixmap is corrupted in some strange way that only
int.unzip sees?

I can reproduce this (with a 1.5.0 prerelease, though). I can't get a
handle on what the reason might be, but it did seem to work simply to
unzip pixmap.zip into rw1050/library. The HTML help will not be quite
perfect, but hey, there are only two functions in the package...

pixmap.zip was built with 1.3.1, so maybe a repackaging would be in
order.

OK, I think I traced this to the fact that "test" on Solaris with the
Bourne shell will be the built-in one which doesn't understand the
-nt operator. Of course my own test builds used /bin/bash...

This is likely not a portable fix, but could you just for verification
try replacing test with /bin/test in the Makefile in tests/Examples?

I can keep doing this up until it is officially released.  But I will not
be doing this on a daily basis.  I'll post up snapshot every three or four
days.

To all,

Recently I created a version of barplot() to include some new features 
as follows:

1. Plot confidence intervals for each bar: The user can pass lower 
(ci.l) and upper (ci.u) bounds in the same vector/matrix format as 
"height".  The CI boundary lines will vary in width per bar, if a 
varying "width" argument is specified. CI line width, type and color can 
be defined.  Defaults to 1, "solid" and black, respectively. Works with 
horizontal or vertical plot. Will work with beside = TRUE. Will not work 
if stacked bar plot results at this time. Argument plot.ci = c("TRUE", 
"FALSE") defines whether these are drawn.

2. Color plot region separately from the background area, if desired. 
Argument "prcol" defaults to NULL.

3. Draw "height" axis grid lines *behind* the bars.  Grid line width, 
type and color can be specified. Defaults to 1, "dotted" and black 
respectively. Argument plot.grid = c("TRUE", "FALSE") defines if the 
grid is plotted.

I have made these modifications with the intent to not "break" any 
existing code, so that identical calls to this version should work the 
same as the current implementation.

The current full function argument list is as follows:

barplot2 <- function(height, ...) UseMethod("barplot2")

barplot2.default <-
function(height, width = 1, space = NULL, names.arg = NULL,
      legend.text = NULL, beside = FALSE, horiz = FALSE,
      density = NULL, angle = 45,
      col = heat.colors(NR), prcol = NULL, border = par("fg"),
      main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
      xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, xpd = TRUE, log = "",
      axes = TRUE, axisnames = TRUE,
      cex.axis = par("cex.axis"), cex.names = par("cex.axis"),
      inside = TRUE, plot = TRUE,
      plot.ci = FALSE, ci.l = NULL, ci.u = NULL,
      ci.color = "black", ci.lty = "solid", ci.lwd = 1,
      plot.grid = FALSE, grid.inc = 5,
      grid.lty = "dotted", grid.lwd = 1, grid.col = "black",
      ...)


In late August, there was a post from Rengie Chan with a query on using 
log axis scaling with barplot(), which is presently precluded as coded 
as per my reply to his post.  I also noted that Paul Murrell has a note 
about this on his to-do page at: 
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/graphicstodos.html

I have spent some time over the past couple of weeks or so (thinking 
that this was going to be easier than it turned out to be) working on 
this as time has permitted.

I now have barplot2() working with both x and/or y axis log scaling, for 
single bars, multiple bars ("beside = TRUE") and for stacked bars.

Some of the key issues are of course preventing log(<=0) related errors 
in the axis scaling, which I have done and incorporating the other 
features that I have added above to be compatible with log scaling. 
These include adjusting the par("usr") values as well as the bar 
baseline values when stacked for log scaling and so forth. Also, the 
"hatch" type bar shading does not work with a log scale, so an error 
check is included to catch this. 

I have attached the R code for this version, called barplot2(), for the 
time being.  I make this code available to R-Core if so desired, and to 
the community at large.  If anyone finds any bugs, let me know.

The areas that I am still a bit unsure of (and open to criticism on) are 
as follows:

1. When using log scaling, I have arbitrarily set the lower limit of the 
"height" related axis to 0.9 * min(height), to enable some of the 
smallest bar to actually be plotted. This figure is adjusted to include 
0.9 * min(ci.l) when plotting CI's.  This can be over-ridden by setting 
either ylim or xlim explicitly of course.  If anyone feels that this 
should be different, let me know.

2. When plotting grid lines, I have resorted to using pretty() to define 
the axis tick marks, labels and grid lines by default.  This took some 
time, after I noted posts to R-Help on the issues with par("xaxp") and 
par("yaxp") when log scaling is used. I also noted Ross Ihaka's 
sci.axis() function. I wrestled with trying to be consistent in the 
behavior of the grid lines for both linear and log scaling and differing 
approaches.

However, given that both barplot() and more significantly the axis() C 
code in plot.c forces "lty = 0" as presently coded, I wanted to give the 
user the ability to visually "de-emphasize" the gridlines with 
alternative line types, widths and colors. Thus I am using abline() with 
intervals set by pretty(), with the user able to specify how many 
intervals using "grid.inc", with a default of 5 as in pretty(). If 
anyone has any better thoughts on how to approach this, I am open.

I was trying to figure out a way to call the C code in plot.c that 
generates the default axis intervals (CreateAtVector), but would get 
errors indicating that the function is not in the load table.  This 
would seem to be a cleaner approach at first glance, since it would 
result in consistent default axis interval behavior when not plotting 
grid lines.  I am open to pointers or other thoughts on this.

Finally, there are two .NotYetUsed arguments in barplot().

First is "border", which defaults to par("fg").  I presume that this is 
simply meant to be the "border" argument to rect()?  If so, I can make 
that change easily.

Second is the "inside" argument.  If I read the help file correctly, 
this will draw a line between adjacent bars.  However, I am unsure if 
this is intended to be a "grouping" line that runs the full height or 
width of the plotting region such that it divides a group of bars (ie. 
beside = TRUE) or if it is simply a heavier line between each bar.  If 
someone can clarify this, I can work on this as well.

I appreciate any feedback from the group and hope that this work is of 
value to users of barplot().

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

The internal variable that holds the value is set at startup.  I don't
think this is a bug, because I don't know of any documentation that
suggests it would do anything else, but it probably would make sense
to read the environment at the time the save is requested, rather than
at startup.

I'm no expert on namespaces, but I think you can, similar to the way
that you now save things into specific environments rather than the
global one.

Well, 2 help pages doesn't mean only 2 functions ... unless you count
all methods for a generic only as one function.

There will be a new release of pixmap next week which contains a
complete rewrite of the code using the methods package, hence it
might not be worth the effort.

Argh.  Not listed under portable shell programming in the Autoconf
manual ...

Otoh, my SysV 7th ed man pages from 79 do not list '-nt' etc, so maybe
we should not use it.  Peter, can you perhaps try rewriting the simple

        if test $(top_builddir)/library/$${pkg} -nt "$@" ; then \

in tests/Examples/Makefile.in using find -newer (which is already in the
7th edition)?

This is something that I have not seen in earlier beta versions of 1.6.0:

That is, the recommened packages are not installed.

I traced this down to the solaris version of make (gmake works fine).

I think the solaris version has problem with the "_tgz" suffixes!

Subject: Install with 64-bit GCC 3.2 (PR#2048)
Message-ID: <200209201634.SAA01188@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Hi,

been trying to build R-1.5.1 for som eof our users here.

No probs with gcc-3.2 32-bit installtion, but thought we'd try it with
the 64-bit just for the crack.

Configuring thus

CC=gcc3 CFLAGS="-m64" CXX=g++3 CXXFLAGS="-m64" F77=g773 FFLAGS="-m64"
LDFLAGS="-m64 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9" ./configure
--prefix=/usr/local/packages/R-1.5.1-64bit

runs OK, however one of the tests (I assume it is a test anyway) fails thus

gcc3 -G  -o ctest.so ansari.o chisqsim.o d2x2xk.o fexact.o kendall.o ks.o  prho.o swilk.o init.o  -L/usr/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2 -L/usr/ccs/bin/sparcv9 -L/usr/ccs/bin -L/usr/ccs/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/ccs/lib -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/../../../sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/../../.. -L/lib/sparcv9 -ldl -ltermcap -lfrtbegin -lg2c -lm -lgcc_s_sparcv9   
ld: fatal: file ansari.o: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to ctest.so
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `ctest.so'
Current working directory /usr/local/packages/src/R-1.5.1/src/library/ctest/src


It appears the make process is not passing the "-m64" flag down from
the LDFLAGS variable as set when running configure.

I have tried a compilation by hand adding this flag to the link stage
and the above compilation goes completes.


Hoping this of use,

I was able to get it all to compile by altering the
src_dir/etc/Makeconf file so that the shared lib LD flags
variables contain -m64

SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS = -G -m64

SHLIB_LDFLAGS = -G -m64

these only had "-G" by default.

Dunno why they dont pick them up as part of the standard configure
though - one for you I guess !

I built it myself. I checked with my Debian system at home, and,
interestingly, there 'dtrmm_' is loaded. Then I reinstalled R-1.5.1, and
'dtrmm_' is still missing! So I get different results on different
_machines_, not different versions of R. I have different setups of atlas
on the two machines. Can that be the cause? Note that not all BLAS
routines are missing, only a selected few. I configure with

./configure --with-gnome --enable-R-shlib

Hmm. On Franz (alias cvs.r-project.org) I seem to be linking against
this guy

[pd@franz pd]$ file /usr/lib/3dnow/atlas/libblas.so.2.3
/usr/lib/3dnow/atlas/libblas.so.2.3: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object,
Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), stripped
                               ********

Could that have something to do with it? The corresponding .a file
does have various incarnations of dtrmm inside.

I'd think so.

I also use --with-blas=blas, but that has in part to do with the magic of
giving you Atlas when you have it installed, and blas if you don't. In other
word the Debian packages depends on a subset (default Blas) which can be
enhanced by installing either the default non-cpu-optimised atlas2-base, or
by installing a cpu-optimised atlas package like atlas2-3dnow for Athlons.
It is a fairly flexible scheme, which out Atlas maintainer developed.

But in short, yes, your Atlas setup on your machine will most likely govern
all of that. If you want a particular feature, I suspect it would help to be
explicit with configure.

I tried that, without success. In fact, no blas library is found, acording
to 'ldd R.bin'. I have

/usr/lib/sse/atlas
/usr/lib/sse

in ld.so.conf and I have run 'ldconfig'. I don't understand why atlas
isn't picked up.

One way for you to make your life easier would be to 

  a) simply install the existing 1.6.0.beta package(s), or 

  b) rebuild it locally as its Build-Depends ought to imply the same
     structure that works for me as well as for eleven build daemons on
     other architectures. 

I suggest we continue this in private mail. Let me know how I can help.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

--Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
--
--There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
--To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
--Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
--cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
--internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
--This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
--mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
--(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
--and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

Actually, I think the problem is already fixed for 1.6.0.  Can you pls
try a current R 1.6.0 beta snapshot?

Subject: socket bug ??? (PR#2056)
Message-ID: <200209231430.QAA16928@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Please help me,

I use R-1.4.1 and everything works fine. But with R-1.5.1 ist does'nt work:

I have this put into a file called "socket.R"

while(TRUE){
con1 <- socketConnection(host="localhost",port=6021,server=TRUE);
source(con1);
close(con1);
}


So I can use R with:

source("socket.R")

and R answers me when I send a command to it via socket 6021. But in version 
1.5.1 it does'nt work. Have you any idea?

Many thanks

I have installed R-1.5.1 using SetupR.exe on both my home laptop (Sony Vaio

they shared the same problem. Both worked for a while, but then Rgui.exe crashed
on the startup, complains:

The exception Floating-point invalid operation.

Despite repeated uninstalled-reboot-install, the crash still persists? Somehow R
remembers it was installed on the machine before, since I can find a new machine
and it will installed and work, but after a while (usually a reboot) it crashes

You may need to add blocking=TRUE to the call.  When I do that I can
connect by telnet and send commands (although they aren't run until I
close the connection.)

If you start it with the command line option "--vanilla", it will skip
a lot of automatically executed code at the beginning.  Could you try
that and see if it fixes the problem?

If so, then it might be worth narrowing down which part is
responsible, by adding the individual options one at a time:
--no-save, --no-restore, --no-site-file, --no-init-file
and --no-environ.

If --vanilla has no effect, then it might just be a coincidence that
it works at first.  The usual culprit for spurious floating point
exceptions is code that plays around with the floating point control
word, and doesn't restore it properly.  Many buggy video drivers do
this, for instance.  I could send you some code that detects this bug,
but it's hard to determine what software caused it.

Thanks, Duncan, for your help. I have tried each of the suggestions:

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --vanilla

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-save

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-restore

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-site-file

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-init-file

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-environ

Each case results in the same crash. By the way, how do I restore the
"floating point control word" ? I don't intentionally run video on my
desktop, but maybe something like in real player/ms media player...

Thanks again

Zhen

After starting R, when I give a graphic command (e.g. barplot, plot, etc.) R
crashes with the comment from Windows "Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be
closed by Windows. . . . "  I have tried reinstalling msvcrt.dll in the \bin

By the way, I have found the offending application: it is a virtual screen
manager called JSP2. As soon as deinstalled it, R works just fine.

Hopefully this will help other people may have similar problems.

Thanks again for your help,

Strange. Try to start R with --vanilla. Does the error persist?

Two bugs here, one trivial: The error message should say B, not A. The
(slightly) less trivial one is that b needs conversion to matrix for
the underlying Lapack routine to work:

Confirmed. The Problem is the wrong error message in the underlying C
code, file .../src/modules/lapack/Lapack.c, line 303:
    error("A must be a complex matrix");
must be changed to
    error("B must be a complex matrix");

Thanks, I can live with that, but for conformance with the man page and
with splus (3.4) it would be nice if B could be a (complex) vector.

Subject: split.screen problem (PR#2069)
Message-ID: <200209261737.TAA21302@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Chris Bodily
Version: 1.5.1
OS: W2K
Submission from: (NULL) (63.106.106.2)


I took the following code directly from the 'split.screen' help page in R and
modified one line to highlight the problem I encountered.  Basically, it appears
that when plotting in split screens and attempting to return to a particular
screen to add or update points, the axes from the original plot are not
remembered, causing the new points to plot incorrectly.
 
A workaround seem to be storing the original plot range and issuing
'plot(x,y,type="n")' where x and y are data vectors with ranges that match the
original plot in the screen of interest.  Then a 'points' command draws in the
correct locations.
 
I found this by moving working code from S-Plus 2000 into R v1.5.1 and noticed
that a particular interactive plot I use began drawing incorrectly.
 
Thanks,
 
Chris Bodily

Subject: rsync.r-project.org and cran.us.r-project.org
Message-ID: <6radm48jb1.fsf@bates3.stat.wisc.edu>

Around noon Wednesday, Sept 25, the machine that serves as
rsync.r-project.org and cran.us.r-project.org had a catastrophic disk
failure.  I came back to my office after a lecture and immediately
thought "I don't think disk drives are supposed to make grinding
noises".  :-)

It was the drive with the system files that failed.  Most user files
and the CRAN archive (not to mention the CVS archive) are on another
drive that is running fine.  However, we did have to build and install
the operating system from scratch then reinstall the files from the
backups.

Many people provided a great deal of help and we now have that
computer running.  I believe that rsync services and the CRAN mirror
are running as expected.  Be aware that they have not been updated
since early Wednesday morning (U.S. Central Time).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0209010823180.5400-100000@gannet.stats>

The help page is correct: please read it more carefully:

     `gc' returns a matrix with rows `"Ncells"' (cons cells, usually 28
     bytes each on 32-bit systems and 56 bytes on 64-bit systems, and
     `"Vcells"' (vector cells, 8 bytes each), and columns `"used"' and
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    `"gc trigger"', each also interpreted in megabytes (rounded up to
     the next 0.1Mb).

`30158416 bytes' is your invention: gc() actually reports `30158416
Vcells'.

It *is* matrix as stated, and not a list!

This looks like a problem with package dependencies.  Should be sending this to

An attempt to install lattice from the windows binary runs OK, but attempting to
load the library an error occurs:

> install.packages("D:/Software/R/lattice.zip", .lib.loc[1], CRAN = NULL)
updating HTML package descriptions
> library(lattice)
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : syntax error on line 2022

I then tried installing under linux with R 1.5.1

This installed OK, but loading the library gave another error:

> library(lattice)
Error in library(grid) : There is no package called `grid'

Installing grid on linux resulted in lattice loading and working properly

Installing grid also fixed the problem on windows.

It *is* package dependency, exactly.  lattice is wholly dependent upon grid,
so, in short,
no grid, no lattice.  On windows, I believe the installation of binary
packages simply unzip the package zip file(s) to the appropriate folder.  No
checks for dependency until loading time.

To R-devel:  Can package dependencies be checked at installed time, at least
for source packages?

Note the R version (1.3).

grid and lattice have been part of the Windows binary distribution since
1.4.0.  grid depends critically on the R version, so don't change it
unless you know exactly what you are doing.

library() in  1.6.0 will do a lot more checks of the package to be loaded.

Nope.  What packages are available depends on the current .libPaths(),
hence can only be known at load time.  There has been a long-term plan
that installing a package would also install its dependencies, but
the dynamic nature of R libraries (the dirs in which packages are
installed) makes this tricky.

Subject: Rwave installation problem (PR#1974)
Message-ID: <200209020727.JAA27891@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Linc Davis
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Mac OS 10.1.5
Submission from: (NULL) (68.4.90.94)


When running install.packages("Rwave") as root, I got this error:

In file included from compinteg.c:12:
kernel.h:22: malloc.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [compinteg.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'Rwave'

There are 3 header files 'malloc.h' in Mac OS X: one for generic C, one for
Objective-C, and a private one for the OS. The R installation script looks for C
headers in /usr/include, but the actual path to this one is

/usr/include/sys/malloc.h

I worked around the problem by copying the file as indicated, then I deleted the
copy after compiling the package. To fix the bug, the script should be changed
to look for C headers in both /usr/include and /usr/include/sys.

Thanks.

Subject: matrices and arrays loose dimension after multiplying with scalar (PR#1979)
Message-ID: <200209031545.RAA14954@pubhealth.ku.dk>

A matrix or array with one of its dimensions having zero elements looses its
dimension after multiplying with scalar.
Admittedly this is an extreme case, however it DOES make sense to retain an
objects formal structure after multiplying with a scalar, as e.g. a matrix
with zero rows IS a legal object in S. BTW, the prototype does retain the
dimension.

Danke, Jens!

o still happens in R-devel (aka 1.6.0 "unstable") of today.

o yes, it's a bug  though not a high-priority one {and we are
  approaching deep feature freeze real soon now...}

Subject: FIX for old and new problems with order(): order fails with na.last=NA (PR#1981)
Message-ID: <200209031913.VAA15648@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I recently reported order() to ignore decreasing=TRUE with na.last=NA.
Now I discovered two other problems and send corrected code.

# PROBLEM 1 see PR#1906


# PROBLEM 2
> order(1, na.last=NA)
Error in apply(sapply(z, is.na), 1, any) : 
        dim(X) must have a positive length

Error in order(c(NA, NA), na.last = NA) : all elements contain an NA
# The help file promises ordering indices to all non-NA elements. 
# Thus, if all elements are NA, consequently the result should be integer(0)

Hi,

the R News editors are looking for a volunteer to do a book
review. The book is

	"Statistical computing.  An introduction to data-analysis using
	S-Plus" by Michael J. Crawley (pub. John Wiley & Sons, 2002).

The usual deal for book reviews in journals applies: You do the review
and get a free copy of the book.

Subject: t(xmax)
Message-ID: <3D77613F.31B79516@bank-banque-canada.ca>

Extending a recent R help discussion:

> xmat2 <- ts(matrix(rnorm(100),ncol=2))
> end(t(xmat2))
 [1] 50  1
# this implies 50 periods of data
> dim(t(xmat2))
 [1]  2 50
# this implies 2 periods of data on 50 series

(In R 1.5.1 on Solaris.) I think this should be considered a bug in t(),
which probably should not preserve ts attributes. I will file it as a
bug unless there are other opinions. I guess there are other
possibilities (such as, the documentation for the structure of a ts
should be changed), but I think t() preserving the mts and ts class and
attributes will probably break lots of other things.

Hi,

 I am not sure if this is a bug in layout or I am doing something silly.
 If it is a bug I will file a proper report.

here goes:

plot.new()
old.pars<-par()

 #try to divide the device into a big and small component
 layout(matrix(c(1,2),1,2),widths=c(lcm((old.pars$pin[1]-1)*2.2),lcm(2.2)))
 lay.pars<-par()
 names(old.pars)[!old.pars%in%lay.pars]
 [1] "cxy"   "fig"   "mfcol" "mfg"   "mfrow" "pin"   "plt"
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] -0.2828187  5.2876886
 #Huh? should this be negative?
 dev.off()
 plot.new()
 layout(matrix(c(1,2),1,2),widths=c(5,1))
 lay.pars<-par()
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] 0.01610944 5.28768865
 plot.new()
 lay.pars<-par()
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] 4.676389 5.287689
 Reverse of what I would have thought.
 
 Thanks

Because the "current plot" at this point is the second (narrower) plot
(see below), which does not actually have room for a plot (the margins
are wider than the total width allocated so the plot region is
negative).  If at this point you type "plot.new()" twice, the second
call will give an error complaining about margins being too big.

R keeps an index of which plot it is up to.  The index runs from 1 to
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.  Whenever plot.new() is called,
this index is incremented by 1 and it wraps back to 1 when it exceeds
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.

When you call layout() it sets the "current" plot region to be
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.  Note that the first thing that
must happen before any drawing can occur is a call to plot.new().  Then
when you call plot.new() it tries to go to the "next plot" which adds 1
to the "current plot" counter, which wraps back around to 1.  

I think what is causing most confusion here is the fact that the call to
layout() is setting things up ready for the next call to plot.new(),
which in turn sets everything up ready for the actual graphical output
to occur (via axes(), lines(), ...).

The short answer:  no it is not a bug :)

Hope that helps.

Paul

Subject: explict sharing of symbols between packages
Message-ID: <3D786605.92B582FE@csiro.au>

Hi everyone,

I'm thinking about breaking up a large package I have to
avoid loading some of the more specialised parts when it
isn't necessary.

The package is dependent on shared libraries. The base one
will keep all of the core stuff like constructors etc and
the specialised parts will need to access these. It is
obviously possible to set the "local" flag to false, however
this becomes a dangerous, especially with the larger
package.

Is there any way to define a group of packages that share a
symbol table? That would seem to me to be a possible
solution.

Can anyone offer advice on this?

Thanks

Are you talking about the R symbol table, or the symbol table in the
dynamically linked libraries? 

If the former, then (until namespaces are implemented) they *always*
share symbol tables.  Every routine can see every other routine.

Your comment about a "local" flag makes me think you're talking about
an external library.  This may be system dependent.  In Windows it's
not possible to do what you want to do.  A DLL exports certain
symbols, and there's no way to merge that table with the table from
another DLL.  However, it is normal to import routines specifying both
the routine name and which DLL they come from, so name clashes don't
need to be a problem.

repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the

--Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.

--There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
--To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
--Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
--cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
--internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
--This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above

--(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy

 > a=strptime("2002-06-01 12:15:01","%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
 > a
[1] "2002-06-01 12:15:01"
 > a+0
[1] "2002-06-01 05:15:01"
 > a+3600
[1] "2002-06-01 06:15:01"
 > b=c(a)
 > b
[1] "2002-06-01 05:15:01"

TZ is set to +0100 dy default on the Carbon R.

Hi,
I think I am beginning to understand how this works, but obviously not
fully. layout changes the following pars
[1] "cxy"  "fig"  "fin"  "mfg"  "pin"  "plt"  "usr"  "xaxp" "yaxp"

and as you state below moves the counter to N so after layout is called
if par is called one gets the pars for the Nth plot. Now after a call to
plot.new() the counter is set to 1 and a call to par gets the pars() for
the current plot.

what if I have a call to layout in a function, and i want to alter the
parameter "pin" in the first plot? Advancing through using plot.new()
does not seem to work because pin gets set each time the frame advances.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Nicholas

Did you run tools/rsync-recommended? (See
http://developer.r-project.org/devel-guidelines.txt)

(Vince, I'd appreciate a slightly longer fuse before having *changes*
in the build procedure for the development version show up on the
public bug lists. You might have asked R-core.)

Subject: explict sharing of symbols between packages

Hi Richard.

 This issue arises reasonably often. Doug Bates has brought it up on a
few occassions, specifically related to packages that want to use
routines that are located in R modules (lapack). And many of the
Omegahat packages are naturally split into different packages that
share a set of common routines. 

As you point out, you can use 
   dyn.load("foo.so", local = FALSE)
to get the symbols in foo.so directly into 
the global symbol table and make them available
to other dynamically loaded code.
This can introduce a whole range of other problems

There are a few different approaches you can use.

a) Put the common code into a native library (e.g. libCommon.a or libCommon.so)
 and then arrange to have each of the packages that use these routines
 link against this. For Windows, you will explicitly export the symbols
 that are to be shared from this library.

 In this model, the library of common routines (libCommon.so) is not
 used dynamically loaded by R. Instead is one step removed, being
 linked into .so's or .dll's that are.

 This is probably the most practical approach. However, it will require
 that you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or PATH on Windows) variable
 to include the directory containing libCommon.so/dll so that the dynamic loader
 can find it at run time.

 Also, if you use global variables in the common library, some systems
 require coaxing to ensure that there is only one instance of those variables
 shared across all the different libraries.


b) If you really want to have 



I have some example packages that illustrate this.  If there is
interest, I will tidy them up and write up a more complete description
of the different approaches.

Kurt Hornik and I have agreed to implement a mechanism after R 1.6 is
released.  It will probably use one or more of these approaches and
make them much easier.

Oops. Thought I was postponing that mail and sent it instead.
So here is the alternative approach, i.e. b)

Rather than use the linker to connect the calls to the common routines
and their definitions in a secondary library (e.g. libCommon.so), you
can resolve and set the symbols yourself.  Specifically, you use
function pointers in the code that calls the shared routines and then
when you load the packages, you arrange to have these variables refer
to the actual routines that you want.

For example, suppose we have two packages - A and B and A has a
routine named foo() that we want to call in the routine bar() located
in B.

So A.c has
void
foo(void)  {
  ...
}

And B.c has

void (*foo_ptr)(void);

void 
bar()
{
  /* Want to call bar() */
 (*foo_ptr)();
}

Given this setup, you need to have an initialization
routine in B.c that sets the value of the variable foo_ptr.
There are two ways to do this.
You can call R_FindSymbol() within C code.

Using the initialization routine in package B
void R_init_B(DllInfo *dll)
{
   foo_ptr = R_FindSymbol("foo", "A", NULL);
}


Alternatively, you can do the lookup in R and pass
the address of foo() as an argument to a routine in B.

a <- getNativeSymbolInfo("foo", PACKAGE = "A")
.Call("setFoo", a,  PACKAGE = "B")

And the C routine setFoo()  looks something like

SEXP setFoo(SEXP address)
{
  foo_ptr = R_ExternalPtrAddr(address);
  return(R_NilValue);
}


This approach, compared to linking libraries, allows you to
dynamically change routines. This can be useful but is probably
overkill for your example. However, this approach does not rely 
on linkers idiosyncrasies.

 Hope this helps.

  D.

Subject: No reorder.factor in R
Message-ID: <C71CB7425639D311A7A40008C7286AB006A54FBF@carina.phibred.com>


I was using R 1.5.1 today with an old script from S-Plus and discovered that
R does not have reorder.factor.  

It's a very simple function, but very handy for re-arranging factors in
lattice graphics (among other places).  Would it make sense to add this
function to the base code
in order to increase compatability with S-Plus and add additional
functionality?

reorder.factor <- function(fac, y, fun=mean, ...){
  ordered(fac, levels=levels(fac)[order(tapply(y, fac, fun, ...))])
}

reorder.factor is part of Trellis and I believe little used elsewhere.
That makes it a prime candidate for lattice.

I always thought it should be called `order.factor' as factors are not
normally ordered (although Trellis assumes they are).

Forwarded to r-devel since it is a slight change of topic

 - it seems that it might be worth considering putting two special
 variables into the lapply/sapply environment,
   .currentIndex and .currentTag 

  - these are both hard to get right now, and the solutions that
 people are finding, seem to depend on the order in which the lapply
 is applied (that might change -- also, if we get some form of
 parallelism going this solution should be nicer).

Use

lapply(seq(along=lst).  function(i, vec, lst){body}, vec=vec, lst=lst)

using the index i in the body.

Or just use a for loop.

Subject: R 1.6.0 beta
Message-ID: <x2ptvlub4i.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>

R 1.6.0 has gone into final feature freeze as of today.

As a new feature, we'll make interim beta versions available via

ftp://cran.us.r-project.org/pub/R/src/base

alias 

http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base

(filename R-1.6.0beta_*.tar.gz, where * is the creation date). 

If you want to help ensure that the final 1.6.0 works satisfactorily
on *your* platform, it might be a good idea to make a test build of
the beta and report any errors back. 

The plan is to make versions daily, although some days might be
skipped if the build script fails.

We now bundle the recommended packages with the base sources.

--------------
The procedure for building and testing everything can be as simple as
 
<unpack sources> 
cd R-1.6.0 
./configure && make && make fullcheck 

(Make fullcheck can take a long time, especially in the boot and nlme
packages).

The current version in known to pass the checks for our Linux/x86
systems but has two known problems on Solaris/gcc: An optimizer bug in
gcc 3.0.3 causing "cluster" to fail in mona.f and a convergence issue
with the glns example in nlme.

Subject: Old-style classes: bug fix & request
Message-ID: <3D7E13E5.2002332@research.bell-labs.com>

Bug fix:

A bug introduced in version 1.6 failed to "initialize" some old-style
(aka "S3") classes, producing possible warning messages if those classes
were used in the signature of a method in the methods package.

The real bug, though, was that old-style inheritance could not be
included, until the setOldClass function was provided.  Initializing the
methods package now defines a number of old-style classes, some with
inheritance.

The bug & its fix are only relevant if you want to use old-style classes
in defining formal methods.

Request:

The request is for input on other classes that need to be included or
currently included classes not treated correctly.

Roughly, if there is an assignment of class in the base package that
does not break the consistency of classes, we should initialize that
class or classes via a call to setOldClass.  The discussion in
"Programming with Data", pp 449-451 covers some of the issues.

The list of old-style classes processed is in .OldClassesList in the
methods package.  Elements of the list are character vectors; each is
used in a call to setOldClass during initialization.  So elements of the
list with > 1 string define old-style inheritance.

There are a few known classes in the base package NOT currently
initialized:

- "noquote": The use of the "noquote" class breaks the class model
because it inserts a class name _after_ an arbitrary other class name,
changing the hierarchy from one object to another.  Can't be
consistently used in setOldClass.

- "listof" and "list.of".  It wasn't clear whether these are different
and if so, whether both should be included.

Ideally, we would like the call to setOldClass to be associated with the
package that uses the S3 class, but to do so requires using the methods
package in initializing the other package.

For the moment, the proposal is to handle in the methods package the
old-style classes in the base package.  For other packages, we need a
different solution.

Keeping with the practice of the last two full releases, I took the 20020910 
tarball, and the rec'ed packages, last night and made Debian packages for the
unstable distribution.  I intend to update these weekly before Oct. 1 to ensure
that they do not migrate into testing yet as Debian's unstable is the appropriate
environment for these packages.

The build daemons have already caught up. The page
   http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=r-base
has links to the full build logs on all arches.  As of right now, we already 
have  
   alpha, arm hppa, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, sparc, s390
With the exception of arm, all run (and pass) "make check". Arm has a long-
standing fpu bug which is triggered by one test.

I made a small blunder. I had previously used a naming scheme like e.g.
1.4.1.cvsYYYYMMDD for the 1.5.0 pre-release.  This time I wanted to signal the
1.6.0 nature of the release and picked 1.6.0.rc.20020910  -- but that sorts 
higher than 1.6.0, so I will need to use 1.6.0.rel or 1.6.0.release on October 1.
I hope you're not to offended by this deviation from the simpler "1.6.0" .

Subject: setGeneric(); R CMD check
Message-ID: <20020910150946.B2319@jessie.research.bell-labs.com>

1. Is it always the case that when defining generic functions in
   a package, the package needs to be installed as a binary package
   to avoid having the generic functions in the .GlobalEnv?

2. Defining a generic function in a "non-binary" package triggers 
   a check warning

     $ R CMD check ...
     ...
     * checking for code/documentation mismatches ... WARNING
     Objects with usage in documentation object 'dbApply' but missing from code:
     [1] "dbApply"

   It seems that the generic function dbApply lives in the .GlobalEnv when
   the package is attached (w. library), but not in the package's environment.
   I presume that's why check triggers the warning.

   Is this the case?

*If* this is the case (i.e., packages with setGeneric()s need to be installed
as binaries), perhaps it should be documented somewhere.

... or am I missing something very basic?

Hmm? Which "make" are you using? It's not supposed to start processing
recommended packages until after all the base ones and the specific
tests.

One should be made as part of the make process.


One thing that doesn't quite look right in the Makefile is the

Makedeps: Makefile
        @(for p in $(R_PKGS_BASE); do \
            dep="$${p}-Ex.Rout: $${p}-Ex.R"; \
            dep="$${dep} \$$(top_builddir)/library/$${p}/R/$${p}"; \
            tmp="library/$${p}/libs/$${p}" ; \

Maybe that should be 

        @(for p in $(R_PKGS_BASE) $(R_PKGS_RECOMMENDED_EXPANDED); do \
        <...etc...>

Could you try and see if it helps?

I have successfully compiled it under Windows XP.

Though, as a side track.  I compiled it under Inno Setup 3.0.3-beta.  In the
3.x version, "AlwaysCreateUninstallIcon" is no longer supported.  I had to
deleted the line (Line 12, I believe), added :
    Name: "{group}\R 1.6.0 beta"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"
into the [Icons] block..  I think one can compile without adding in this
line, but the "AlwaysCreateUninstallIcon" must be removed.  (I know this
version of Inno Setup is still at beta stage, but it seems this "feature" is
going to stay :-)).

The resulting installation file, rw1060.exe, is roughly 16.3MB, without
compiled HTML support (I didn't built it).

Thought this may interest some people :-)

Message-ID: <084F0DE2-C548-11D6-8A95-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

Mac OS X 10.2 comes with /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework,
which contains Altivec optimized versions of LAPACK, BLAS (and of
libraries for Digital Signal Processing and BigNums, and a vector
version of the scalar libm). All this is either 8, 16, or 32 bit signed  
and
unsigned integers, or single precision IEEE floating point.

Browse it:   <developer.apple.com/hardware/ve>

Code it:      /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/

Include it:  #include   <vecLib/vecLib.h>

Do it:         cc -faltivec -framework vecLib file.c

Although the use of single precision FP may be a problem for
building all of R, this framework could obviously be used to build
some wickedly fast DSP and linear algebra packages.

You might be a bit alone there, but on the other hand, cygwin and the
autotools are meant to play nicely with each other, so what happens if
you just try? I'd expect that you'll get a few hiccups from things
like #ifdef Win32 implying !Unix but most should compile cleanly. (I
believe I had configure+make working under Cygwin about 4 or 5 years
ago (no X11, obviously), but "lots of water has been passed under the
bridge" since then).

Actually it's not even true for Solaris. I got a sense of deja vu,
looked through my install logs, and found that I had *deleted*
libreadline.so because it conflicted with gcc 3.0.1 when building R
(this was almost exactly a year ago on Sep 10, 2001; the events of the
following day might have dislodged things from my memory!)

That is of course still a possible workaround... 
Or downgrading to gcc 2.95.3, which seems more and more attractive
given all the trouble with gcc 3.x.

I think we'll switch to Inno Setup 3 when it's released.  I'm
especially hoping for the "install from the net" option to be
implemented; that should allow us to include optional TCL/TK
installation, without increasing the size of the distributable by 9
Meg for everyone.

The change you suggested looks like it would be compatible with Inno
2; I'll take a look.

The R error message is:
"Fatal error: Unable to open base package"

The reason is:
getRHome() returns e.g. d:/r-project/R-1.5.1 if called within R (correct)

getRHome() returns e.g. D:/jdk1.3.1_01/jre if R is called from SJava (0.65),
hence
R tries to load the base library from D:/jdk1.3.1_01/jre/library/base/R/base
(very
bad)

I have modified $R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/rhome.c in this way:

char *getRHOME()
{
    char *RHome;

    RHome = getenv("R_HOME");
    if(!RHome)
    {
      RHome = getenv("RHOME");
    }
    if(!RHome)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "No R_HOME environment variable value\n");fflush(stderr);
      exit(1);
    }
    strcpy( rhomebuf, RHome);
    return (rhomebuf);
}

now it works fine!

By "binary", meaning "INSTALL --save" or equivalent?

Yes, and the symptom you mentioned is rather mild, compared to what will
often happen!  Any of the computations that default to assigning
metadata to the global environment will cause problems (setMethod,
setClass, ...) in a default installation, unless all such computations
are wrapped in a function call that can be re-directed from the
.First.lib function to the correct environment.

It's not likely to be worth the effort.

For the present version of R, the simplest approach is probably for the
programmer to arrange for an installation with a saved image, either
through the option to INSTALL or by putting a file "install.R" (an empty
file will do) in the top source directory of the package.

For the next version, we should try to make the process more automatic,
although the only way that would always work seems to be by making
--save the default to INSTALL.

As mentioned, the "CMD check"  problem may be the least of it!

The following snippet will _apparently_ install with or without --save:

### Dummy Package
require("methods")

foo <- function(x)x

setGeneric("foo")

setMethod("foo", "character", function(x) paste("++", x))
###

But in the default install, it fails (annoyingly) when the library is
attached, because the assignment of foo is not in the search list, so
setGeneric doesn't find any definition of "foo".


R> library(DummyPackage)
Loading required package: methods 
Error in setGeneric("foo") : Must supply a function skeleton, explicitly
or via an existing function


It's possible to work around most of the specific problems, but my
feeling is that the natural semantics for the programmer is that  the
same source code should work basically the same way, whether being
sourced into the global environment for initial testing or being
installed as a package.

Yes.  I'll add it to the online help for INSTALL (& the extensions
document?).

By the way, an additional annoyance is that even with --SAVE, this
doesn't quite work always, because the `require("methods")' is only
active at INSTALL time, not when the image is loaded.  It would be nice
to make this carry over automatically as well, but how?

For now, the programmer needs to include the require("methods") in a
First.lib function in the package.

Just to wrap up this thread, for now.

A section has been added to ?INSTALL with hints on installing packages
that use the methods package:

     Packages that require the methods package, and that use functions
     such as `setMethod' or `setClass', should be installed by creating
     a binary image.

     The package should require the methods package, both during
     installation and when the user attaches the package.  A good
     solution for most cases is to include the line
     `require("methods")' twice, once at the beginning of the package's
     R source, and once in the file `install.R' in the package
     directory (the top-level directory, not in the `R' directory below
     that).  The `install.R' file causes an image to be saved, and the
     contents will ensure that methods are available when the package
     is attached.

The suggestions seem to work, at least on some simple tests.  I'm not
aware of situations where this fails, but let me know otherwise.

The documentation should be in the next beta or rsync,  also in the
windows INSTALL help file (but I don't have a way to test that), plus a
pointer in the R-exts document to the online help page.

This doesn't work in the currently released version, because it
doesn't define {uninstallexe}.  I'll leave the install script as is;
once Inno Setup 3 is released, I'll look at the benefits of switching
over to it. Certainly there won't be any change before the 1.6.0
release.

John, 

Thanks for the solution.

Your suggestion seems to work quite nicely and the added paragraphs
to help(INSTALL) are clear.  However, it seems that most people will
not be aware of this issue, and if and when they stumble into it,
looking at ?INSTALL may not be their first thought.  I'm wondering
if it would be helpful to include a similar description (or point to
?INSTALL) in, say, "Writing R Extensions", and/or ?setMethod, etc.?
A line in the Release Notes may also be helpful?

Subject: R 1.6.0 beta
Message-ID: <3D7FA193.5050107@univie.ac.at>

I did a test run of compiling R 1.6.0
I got an error when compiling the recommended packages:

C:\devel\R-1.6.0\src\gnuwin32>make recommended
--- Unpacking recommended packages
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../library/VR/DESCRIPTION'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../library/KernSmooth/DESCRIPTION'. 
  Stop.
......................... some more lines for the other libraries
make: *** [unpack-recommended] Error 2

I noticed that the Makefile in gnuwin32 contains the following lines

../library/%/DESCRIPTION: ../library/RECOMMENDED/%_tgz
	@echo "---- $*"
	(cd ../library; tar zxf Recommended/$*_tgz; touch $@)

but the files in src/library/Recommended
have extensions .tar.gz

is that connected with the problem?

I compiled on win2k

Is this error my fault, did I overlook something?

A confirmation:
Now setting

options(htmlhelp=TRUE,browser="C:\\Program Files\\Internet 
Explorer\\IEXPLORE.EXE")

in etc\Rprofile
also controls which browser is used when help is called from the menu item.

In the tar file all the foo_tgz's are symbolic links to
foo_7.9-13.tar.gz etc. Now, Windows doesn't have symlinks...

You probably have a tar that ignores symbolic links. I believe Brian's 
creates an extra copy of the file. 

The symlinks offered a quick solution to the problem of keeping track
of dependencies on files that change not only their timestamps but
also their name.  (Relevant for the core developers and people who
build from the rsync snapshots.)  I suspect there's a better way, I
just didn't see it before feature freeze...

Message-ID: <5.1.1.5.2.20020911210204.00ac4270@pop.prism.gatech.edu>

    Is it already known that R does not free the memory that it allocates 
during start-up (~10MB) when it exits?  If so, are there currently any 
plans to address this problem?  I noticed that the 1.6.0 beta leaks 
slightly more memory (~300k) than the 1.5.1 stable version.

    I am working on a project that links with the R library, and there is a 
question about unloading and later re-loading the R library, so this memory 
leak could become a real issue.

Thank you.

Hi,

I have updated the chapter on Compile R from Source in my R for Windows
Users guide.  I'm not planning on officially releasing it until R 1.6.0 is
officially released, but if you want a sneak preview of the chapter, you may
get it from http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/pub/R/WinBook/ch4.pdf .
It is targeted at the final official version of R 1.6.0, but should work for
the current beta version too.

A minor point, I just discovered that (while updating the guide) the
R-1.6.0/src/gnuwin32/INSTALL file, Line 56, has a spelling mistake.
prce-3.9.tar.bz2 should be pcre-3.9.tar.bz2 .

Hi Kurt

I currently have on my Mac gcc 2.95.2, 3.1, and 3.3 and the
corresponding g77 versions as well. R builds fine with
the 2.95.2 combo, it also builds fine with gcc 2.95.2 and
g77 3.1. But using gcc 3.1 or gcc 3.3 gives the familiar
problem that I mentioned before (although the 3.1
combination does build scilab and octave fine).

checking for dummy main to link with Fortran 77 libraries... unknown
configure: error: linking to Fortran libraries from C fails

I include the config.log for the build with gcc 2.95.2 and g77 3.1
(which works) and for the one with gcc 3.1 and g77 3.1, which fails.

Is that configure test, the one that fails, really needed ?

By the way, gcc 3.1 with f2c also works -- but that fails to build
some packages such as splancs and subselect.

More by the way, gcc 3.1 and 2.95.2 come with OS X, g77 3.1
and 2.95.2 come from fink, gcc 3.3 and g77 3.3 come from Apple's
CVS. f2c also from fink.

Subject: R-1.6.0-beta compiling on Solaris with gcc-3.2
Message-ID: <3D80380E.6EDB0682@statistik.uni-dortmund.de>

Compiling R-1.6.0-beta (or any other) with gcc-3.2 just with

 ./configure
 make

 ... works - great!


But there are these annoying warning messages after *each* call to any
of the gcc tools, as in:

 gcc -I. -I../../src/include -I../../src/include -I/usr/local/include 
   -DHAVE_CONFIG_H   -g -O2 -c phyper.c -o phyper.o
 cc1: warning: changing search order for system directory 
   "/usr/local/include"
 cc1: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system 
   directory

I am not really sure if there is something special with our system?
If not, is it possible to solve that in the configure script for a later
version of R?

Working on a Linux box, I originally found the leak using a memory 
management program that I wrote.  I confirmed the leak using the Valgrind 
program (http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/), which produces a nice 
output.  If you would like, I can post a full or edited output from that 
program.  The majority of the memory is allocated using the GetNewPage 
function in memory.c and appears to still be in the table of allocated 
pages when R exits.

Note that this about initialisation of the R shared library R.so, not the
R executable.

This may need fixing -- with a standalone executable the operating system
will handle memory release when the program exits, but with an R library
dynamically loaded into another process it won't.

OTOH, why do you want to load and unload R lots of times?

I'm a little unclear on what you mean by "when R exits".  R currently
does not have a mechanism for explicitly releasing all its heap
memory.  That is fine when R is run as a process, the original design,
since the OS will release its memory when R exits (normally or
otherwise).  When R is used as a shared library then there is no way
at this point to tell R that you are done with its heap and make sure
it is released. You can build a customized cleanup function and
install it so R_CleanUp calls it, but we currently don't provide a
hook for releasing the heap from that function.  There are other
resources that we do not have convenient means of releasing explicitly
also, such as all loaded shared libraries.  Being able to have
separate R sessions within a single process is something some of us
have talked about and that will require getting a handle on these
issues, but we're not there yet.

process_site_Renviron() doesn't seem to be called anywhere in the
windows sources. Fix:

.../src/gnuwin32/system.c obviously needs (diff'ed to R-1.6.0 beta
(2002-09-10)):

In that case we have to change  .../src/unix/sys-common.c  (?) as well,
because R_Home seems to be empty at this point on Windows. I was not
able to figure out why, maybe Duncan has a better solution?
A quick hack:

I misunderstood the context.  The same problem would likely occur in
Windows if your application uses R.dll.

I agree that this should be fixed in the long term:  one might want to
instantiate multiple copies of R's evaluator in some application (e.g.
a new front-end that ran multiple consoles), and there should be a way
to shut them down and clean up afterwards.  In the meantime, the
workaround is probably to just keep a list of the activated copies,
and when a new one is needed, check if there's an unused one in the
list.  If so, execute some code to clean up the environment, and
re-use it.

R : Copyright 2002, The R Development Core Team
Version 1.6.0 beta (2002-09-11)

Debian/gcc-3.2

Building and fullchecking caused no errors to talk about, but

$ R CMD check my.package

failed on the example. From my.package-Ex.Rout:
....
Error in match.call(definition, call, expand.dots) :
        NULL is not a logical
Execution halted

This does not happen in 1.5.1, and in 1.6.0, if I install my.package
and run the example, it works fine.

yes.
You are using "T" and "F" in your package instead of "TRUE" and "FALSE".
This is now tested a bit (by setting T <- F <- NULL).

NEWS of "R-1.6.0 beta" 
----		       (probably should be read by ``everyone'')	
has

||     o	R CMD check now tests for mis-use on an installed or binary
|| 	package, and sets 'T' and 'F' to 'NULL' when running the examples.

where I'm pretty sure you won't be the only one..

BTW, (not to Göran, but the publich), also in NEWS

||    o	The assignment operator `_' is deprecated: a warning is	given
||	once per R session.

which really suggests to everyone (you should finally listen ;-) ..
your R code might no longer run in the not so distant future (some time
next year probably) when you'll still be using "_" for assignment

Is a file owner or something set wrong in the snapshot?

I tried yesterday's snapshot a few times but had trouble with an
unexpected EOF in the gunzip. This is usually a glitch in the download,
but it happened a couple of times, with both wget and Netscape, so I
suspect the source may have been corrupt.

Brian had already raised this some time ago---Brian, is there an obvious
fix?  If not, then we need a configure check for GCC version 3.2 or
better and inititialize CPPFLAGS accordingly?

Subject: [R] proposal: mosaicplot with sub and las
Message-ID: <20020913105944.A2318@s1x.zimnet.ch>


Two proposals for mosaicplot():

- The argument "sub" should not be ignored.
  Example: mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, sub = 'test of sub' )

- To be able to discern also longer axis labels
  the argument "las" or par(las=2) should not be ignored.
  Example: mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, las=2 )

Thanks

You have just to change three lines in mosaicplot.default(). 
Since you provided a very nice suggestion to improve dotchart()
(THANKS!), please, would you provide a suggestion for this one too?

That will be a bit more difficult than just using las, because
annotation is done by text(), not mtext() nor axis(). One have to
calculate with the las values in the srt argument of the text() calls.
I am sure you will provide a suggestion for the improvement soon. [If
you don't get it to work, just send a private e-mail.]

Well, to answer my own question:

You stupidly forgot to get rid of the directory created the day before,
and the date-stamp file is read only so tar cannot overwrite it. You
should know better. Have a good weekend.

Subject: missing data in stripchart (PR#2018)
Message-ID: <200209141735.TAA07686@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jonathan Baron
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (151.201.155.186)


The documentation of stripchart() says that "NA's are allowed in
the data."  I think this would imply that

stripchart(nprob[cancer==4] ~ probtype[cancer==4],meth="stack")

should work even if nprob has a missing datum in the relevant range.
I get the following error message:

Error in xy.coords(x, y) : x and y lengths differ
In addition: Warning message: 
longer object length
is not a multiple of shorter object length in: y + (unlist(xo, use.names =
FALSE) - 1) * offset * csize 

The following works.  There was one missing datum.

stripchart(nprob[cancer==4 & !is.na(nprob)] ~ probtype[cancer==4 &
!is.na(nprob)],meth="stack")

So, either the behavior or the documentation appears to need changing.
I would prefer to change the behavior so it matches the documentation.

Jon

In case you want this - and feel free to delete this - here are the
data for the bug I just reported concerning missing data in
stripchart.

You need to run hrp2.R.  Please excuse the extraneous junk.  This was
written mostly by a grad student who was learning R in the process
(Andrea Gurmankin).  She doesn't like to delete things.

Subject: Running Median and Mean
Message-ID: <15749.62506.473601.799299@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

R gurus,

On Aug 20, 2002, I asked in R-help about calculating a running 5-day median on
a large matrix.  Thanks to Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch> and Ray
Brownrigg <Ray.Brownrigg@mcs.vuw.ac.nz> for responding.

I ended up writing C code (and an R interface) to do it, which is about 1000x
faster than the naive method!  (72s became .09s on a 223 x 520 matrix).  I
added a running mean function too, which is very simple and is about 15x
faster than apply(..., filter, ...).  I've packaged the code as
  <http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Devel/runStat_1.1.tar.gz>

The key insight was that it *is* in fact a good idea to calculate the ranks of
the 5 data points, because then it is easy to calculate how those ranks
*change* as you step through the column.  For example, suppose the last few
points in a column look like:
   data=  20 25 18 14 78 55 29
   rank=      3  2  1  5  4
where I have ranked the 5 points prior to the last one.  The median is 25 (the
point with rank 3).  Stepping to the left:
   data=  20 25 18 14 78 55 29
   rank=   3  4  2  1  5
For the 4 points that overlap, their ranks remain the same, except they are
incremented by one for points >=20, and decremented by one for points >55.  The
rank of the new point (20) is just 5 minus the number of increments done.

The code is copied below for your amusement.  Suggestions welcome.  Note I have
not dealt with NA's, even values of N, row-wise medians, or non-lagged medians
(i.e. I put the median of points 1:5 into position 6, not position 5).  It
would be great if somebody (Martin?) wanted to incorporate these functions into
an existing package or even "base"; otherwise I'll post the final product on
CRAN/src/contrib.

{David's a package too}

Note that I said originally,
that I have had code for years (available on request) and
planned to add these to "modreg" (one of the standard packages). 

Further note that I was talking about two algorithms
1) something along the lines David is using,
   where I got the original algorithm from Werner Stuetzle from
   in Fortran (from the 80's).
2) the optimal algorithm of Haerdle & Steiner (and Turlach)
   which can be another order of magnitude faster.

 --> Ref. @article{hae:stei:1995,
       Author = {H\"ardle, W. and Steiger, W.},
       Title = {{O}ptimal Median Smoothing [{Algorithm AS} 296]},
       Year = 1995,
       Journal = {Applied Statistics},
       Volume = 44,
       Pages = {258--264},
   }

I do agree I should have published the code much earlier...

Actually, layout() sets par(pin) only if you have not specified it
deliberately.  For example, the following respects the par(pin) setting
...

par(pin=c(1,1))
layout(matrix(c(1,1,0,2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
plot.new()
plot.window(range(1:10), range(1:10))
points(1:10)
box()

... does that do something like what you want?  (you have to do
something like par(pty="m") if you want to "remove" the par(pin)
setting)

yes.

The following seems a cautious solution:

t.ts <- function(x) {
    cl <- class(x)
    other <- !(cl %in% c("ts","mts"))
    class(x) <- if(any(other)) cl[other]
    attr(x, "tsp") <- NULL
    t(x)
}

It passes "make check" and I plan to commit as bug fix to  
R (beta) 1.6.0.

Subject: Documentation for passing character NAs to .C
Message-ID: <umgeoucmeciai57h9fb14p9sksaha3atrf@4ax.com>

I can't see any mention in the docs of what happens when a character
string NA is passed to an external function.  What appears to happen
is that it is converted to the two letter string 'NA'; I can't think
of anything better to do, but this should be mentioned somewhere (or
perhaps more prominently).  

The places I thought to look were the .C help file, and section 4.2 of
the Writing Extensions manual.

Subject: switch (PR#2033)
Message-ID: <200209172125.XAA01381@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Ron Wehrens
Version: 1.5.0
OS: Linux, Solaris, OSF alpha
Submission from: (NULL) (128.95.17.61)


Consider these two functions:
switchme <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(type,
         E = max(...),
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}
switchme2 <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(type,
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}
The bottom one does what I expect. The top one only gives one answer,
independent 
of the second argument.
> switchme2("V", 1:4)
[1] 4
> switchme2("X", 1:4)
[1] -100
> switchme2("EII", 1:4)
[1] 10
> switchme("V", 1:4)
[1] 24
> switchme("X", 1:4)
[1] 24
> switchme("EII", 1:4)
[1] 24
 
Is there something special about "E"?

Jan,

Thanks for the update, and the additional info.

The test that fails is AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN, one of the standard Autoconf
tests, required in particular to determine the kind of Fortran name
mangling.  So yes, it is necessary.

The failure seems to come from the fact that when trying to determine
the dummy main to link with the Fortran 77 libraries, all efforts fail
along the lines of

configure:14562: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -I/sw/include -I/usr/local/include -L/sw
/lib -L/usr/local/lib conftest.c -lreadline -ldl -lncurses -lm   -lcrtbegin.o -L

> Is there something special about "E"?

Yes. It matches the EXPR arg to switch using partial matching, so the
case selector becomes max(1:4) == 4 and the fourth case is used to gie
prod(1:4) == 24. Not a bug, although perhaps a feature regretted by
the inventor...

The workaround (except for avoiding case labels E, EX, EXP) is 

switchme <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(EXPR=type,
         E = max(...),
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}

Subject: problem with make fullcheck on Sparc Solaris 8
Message-ID: <3D88A9CB.6080105@stat.ohio-state.edu>

I have been trying out R-1.6.0 tarballs (2002-9-10 and 2002-9-17) on:

arch     sparc
os       solaris2.8
system   sparc, solaris2.8
status   beta
major    1
minor    6.0
year     2002
month    09
day      17
language R

As you see form above, R-1.6.0 compiles fine and works.  However, when I 
  "make fullcheck" I get the following error:

running code in 'tools-Ex.R' ... OK
running code in 'ts-Ex.R' ... OK
running code in 'survival-Ex.R' ...bash: survival-Ex.R: No such file or 
directory
mv: cannot access survival-Ex.Rout

See the full output from "make fullcheck" at the end of this message.

It seams that the test examples for the recommended packages are never 
created.

I have both used GNU-tools (gmake version 3.79.1) and Solaris tools, but 
with the same results.


Any feedback would be great,
Gardar

I've just had the same problem (with 2002-9-12) on Solaris 2.8 using GNU
tools.

Thanks, but the problem was supposedly fixed by this change

Thu Sep 12 17:15:43 UTC 2002, hornik
  Need 'R_LIBS=' when calling R CMD INSTALL.
  R/src/library/Recommended Makefile.in,1.10

so a build of 2002-9-12 is not very informative.

Could you two please

a) Retry with a clean build (just in case)
b) Tell us whether you have R_LIBS set
c) Tell us whether you build in the source directory or separately
d) Show the output of ls `bin/R RHOME`/library

(should be like this

[pd@butterfly BUILD]$ ls `bin/R RHOME`/library
base     ctest    grid        MASS     mva   R.css    stepfun   ts
boot     e1071    KernSmooth  methods  nlme  rpart    survival
class    eda      lattice     mgcv     nls   spatial  tcltk
cluster  foreign  lqs         modreg   nnet  splines  tools

)

and also check whether survival has the R-ex subdirectory with the
relevant contents.

Here is a test case:

# Some arbitrary data
#
v1<-1:12
v2<-cumsum(v1)
v3<-cumsum(v2)
f<-factor(rep(c("a","b","c"),4))
y<-c(1,4,2,7,5,8,7,9,6,10,12,10)
print(cbind(y,f,v1,v2,v3))
#
# Fit a regression model with no intercept, and different slopes
# for each value of the factor
#
ans<-lm( y ~ -1 + v1/f + v2/f + v3/f, contrasts=list(f=contr.sum))
print(as.matrix(ans$coefficients))

And its output:

Though I asked for "sum" contrasts, the v1 coefficients came back
with "treatment" contrasts.  I don't see any technical reason why
"sum" contrasts can't be computed.  Is it a bug?

Also, why should the order of the variables be reversed (f1:v2 where
I would have expected v2:f1, etc.)?

By the way, S-plus refuses to fit this model at all ("Problem in
model.matrix.default(Terms, m, contrasts): Internal error: predicted 2
columns for f %in% v1, got 3).

Dear R-Gang -
	Two questions for you:
	1)  I cannot figure out how to sort one column in an array, 
and drag the rest of the values that occupy the other columns along 
with the sorted values in the first column.  What I would like to end 
up with is an array that is the same size and dimensions as the first 
array.  When I try various configurations of sort, I keep getting 
vectors instead of the array I started with, and I have not found a 
way to make sort "bind" other values to the sorted values.
	2)  I used a PC version of R over the summer, and was able to 
use rowSum, colSum and similar functions.  These (and other things) 
do not seem to be enabled on the Mac OS9 version.  Are they enabled 
on the OS10 version?  If not, how can I enable them?  And how do I 
download the OS10 version?  My computer does not recognize the .gz 
files on the website http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/atlas/.
	Many thanks,
	Chris Wills

Do this:

	# example data matrix
	datamat <- matrix(rnorm(1000),ncol=20)

	ord <- order(x[,1])
	sortmat <- datamat[ord,]

Versions of R with the same version number generally doe the same
thing on all platforms, so you must have been using an older one.

I believe the one you want is this file

Subject: savehistory directories and quitting R (PR#2038)
Message-ID: <200209190454.GAA13201@pubhealth.ku.dk>

#
#       r-bugs@r-project.org
#
######################################################

Because I work in different directories, but always want to save my
.Rhistory in the same place, I have changed the system function savehistory
to this:

function (file = "D:/R50/.Rhistory") 
invisible(.Internal(savehistory(file)))

When I use q() to quit R, and it asks me whether I want to "save current
workspace", a response of YES means that the .Rhistory is saved in the
current working directory, rather than D:/R50/.Rhistory. I take this to mean
that the quit-on-prompt sequence makes a direct call to .Internal(
savehistory...) rather than going via the actual savehistory() function. It
would be nicer if prompt-on-quit would honour the user's definition of
savehistory.

(Responding NO to the "save current..." prompt means that .Rhistory isn't
saved at all, which is reasonable.)

I admit that this is a very minor bug, because I can set .Last to call
savehistory directly. But I just thought you should know...

cheers
Mark

What happens on shutdown is specific to the platform you're working
on, but in both Windows and Unix versions, the filename is taken from
the R_HISTFILE environment variable.  I don't know if this works on
the Mac.

This would be more obvious if the R savehistory() function were
changed to check the R_HISTFILE environment variable too.

The problem with using the user's savehistory() function is that this
violates the idea of namespaces that we're working towards:  users
should be able to create their own function named "savehistory"
without worrying about changing important internal behaviour.

I will be building and distributing the final release.  Kevin Wang has
been building snapshots and posting them at

 <http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/rinfo.php>

Since I'm going to be out of town from Sept 25 to Oct 1, and I'm busy
preparing for that trip, I haven't been posting snapshots.  If there's
a demand for them and Kevin has to stop, I could do so up to the 25th,
but not easily after that.

The final release will be posted in the usual place on CRAN.  It will
be called rw1060.exe rather than SetupR.exe, and the rw1060??.zip
files will no longer be posted.  The miniR files (which each fit on a
diskette) will be named as before, miniR.exe and miniR-1.bin up to
miniR-7.bin.

Subject: install.packages() together with pixmap package (PR#2042)
Message-ID: <200209191626.SAA21853@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Wolfgang Huber
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Windoof 2000
Submission from: (NULL) (193.174.62.11)


Hi,

Trying to install the binary distribution (zip file) for the "pixmap" package,
as downloaded today from CRAN, I get the following warning "error -1". The
package will not be installed. 
Installation of other packages (e.g. pinktoe, acepack) worked fine. The warning
or error seems to be thrown by .Internal(int.unzip).

I also tried with an external unzip programm, setting: options(unzip="pkunzip").
This eliminates the error message, and install.packages() terminates quietly
without warnings, however also without installing anything (for all of the above
packages).

So, possibly the package pixmap is corrupted in some strange way that only
int.unzip sees?

I can reproduce this (with a 1.5.0 prerelease, though). I can't get a
handle on what the reason might be, but it did seem to work simply to
unzip pixmap.zip into rw1050/library. The HTML help will not be quite
perfect, but hey, there are only two functions in the package...

pixmap.zip was built with 1.3.1, so maybe a repackaging would be in
order.

OK, I think I traced this to the fact that "test" on Solaris with the
Bourne shell will be the built-in one which doesn't understand the
-nt operator. Of course my own test builds used /bin/bash...

This is likely not a portable fix, but could you just for verification
try replacing test with /bin/test in the Makefile in tests/Examples?

I can keep doing this up until it is officially released.  But I will not
be doing this on a daily basis.  I'll post up snapshot every three or four
days.

To all,

Recently I created a version of barplot() to include some new features 
as follows:

1. Plot confidence intervals for each bar: The user can pass lower 
(ci.l) and upper (ci.u) bounds in the same vector/matrix format as 
"height".  The CI boundary lines will vary in width per bar, if a 
varying "width" argument is specified. CI line width, type and color can 
be defined.  Defaults to 1, "solid" and black, respectively. Works with 
horizontal or vertical plot. Will work with beside = TRUE. Will not work 
if stacked bar plot results at this time. Argument plot.ci = c("TRUE", 
"FALSE") defines whether these are drawn.

2. Color plot region separately from the background area, if desired. 
Argument "prcol" defaults to NULL.

3. Draw "height" axis grid lines *behind* the bars.  Grid line width, 
type and color can be specified. Defaults to 1, "dotted" and black 
respectively. Argument plot.grid = c("TRUE", "FALSE") defines if the 
grid is plotted.

I have made these modifications with the intent to not "break" any 
existing code, so that identical calls to this version should work the 
same as the current implementation.

The current full function argument list is as follows:

barplot2 <- function(height, ...) UseMethod("barplot2")

barplot2.default <-
function(height, width = 1, space = NULL, names.arg = NULL,
      legend.text = NULL, beside = FALSE, horiz = FALSE,
      density = NULL, angle = 45,
      col = heat.colors(NR), prcol = NULL, border = par("fg"),
      main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
      xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, xpd = TRUE, log = "",
      axes = TRUE, axisnames = TRUE,
      cex.axis = par("cex.axis"), cex.names = par("cex.axis"),
      inside = TRUE, plot = TRUE,
      plot.ci = FALSE, ci.l = NULL, ci.u = NULL,
      ci.color = "black", ci.lty = "solid", ci.lwd = 1,
      plot.grid = FALSE, grid.inc = 5,
      grid.lty = "dotted", grid.lwd = 1, grid.col = "black",
      ...)


In late August, there was a post from Rengie Chan with a query on using 
log axis scaling with barplot(), which is presently precluded as coded 
as per my reply to his post.  I also noted that Paul Murrell has a note 
about this on his to-do page at: 
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/graphicstodos.html

I have spent some time over the past couple of weeks or so (thinking 
that this was going to be easier than it turned out to be) working on 
this as time has permitted.

I now have barplot2() working with both x and/or y axis log scaling, for 
single bars, multiple bars ("beside = TRUE") and for stacked bars.

Some of the key issues are of course preventing log(<=0) related errors 
in the axis scaling, which I have done and incorporating the other 
features that I have added above to be compatible with log scaling. 
These include adjusting the par("usr") values as well as the bar 
baseline values when stacked for log scaling and so forth. Also, the 
"hatch" type bar shading does not work with a log scale, so an error 
check is included to catch this. 

I have attached the R code for this version, called barplot2(), for the 
time being.  I make this code available to R-Core if so desired, and to 
the community at large.  If anyone finds any bugs, let me know.

The areas that I am still a bit unsure of (and open to criticism on) are 
as follows:

1. When using log scaling, I have arbitrarily set the lower limit of the 
"height" related axis to 0.9 * min(height), to enable some of the 
smallest bar to actually be plotted. This figure is adjusted to include 
0.9 * min(ci.l) when plotting CI's.  This can be over-ridden by setting 
either ylim or xlim explicitly of course.  If anyone feels that this 
should be different, let me know.

2. When plotting grid lines, I have resorted to using pretty() to define 
the axis tick marks, labels and grid lines by default.  This took some 
time, after I noted posts to R-Help on the issues with par("xaxp") and 
par("yaxp") when log scaling is used. I also noted Ross Ihaka's 
sci.axis() function. I wrestled with trying to be consistent in the 
behavior of the grid lines for both linear and log scaling and differing 
approaches.

However, given that both barplot() and more significantly the axis() C 
code in plot.c forces "lty = 0" as presently coded, I wanted to give the 
user the ability to visually "de-emphasize" the gridlines with 
alternative line types, widths and colors. Thus I am using abline() with 
intervals set by pretty(), with the user able to specify how many 
intervals using "grid.inc", with a default of 5 as in pretty(). If 
anyone has any better thoughts on how to approach this, I am open.

I was trying to figure out a way to call the C code in plot.c that 
generates the default axis intervals (CreateAtVector), but would get 
errors indicating that the function is not in the load table.  This 
would seem to be a cleaner approach at first glance, since it would 
result in consistent default axis interval behavior when not plotting 
grid lines.  I am open to pointers or other thoughts on this.

Finally, there are two .NotYetUsed arguments in barplot().

First is "border", which defaults to par("fg").  I presume that this is 
simply meant to be the "border" argument to rect()?  If so, I can make 
that change easily.

Second is the "inside" argument.  If I read the help file correctly, 
this will draw a line between adjacent bars.  However, I am unsure if 
this is intended to be a "grouping" line that runs the full height or 
width of the plotting region such that it divides a group of bars (ie. 
beside = TRUE) or if it is simply a heavier line between each bar.  If 
someone can clarify this, I can work on this as well.

I appreciate any feedback from the group and hope that this work is of 
value to users of barplot().

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

The internal variable that holds the value is set at startup.  I don't
think this is a bug, because I don't know of any documentation that
suggests it would do anything else, but it probably would make sense
to read the environment at the time the save is requested, rather than
at startup.

I'm no expert on namespaces, but I think you can, similar to the way
that you now save things into specific environments rather than the
global one.

Well, 2 help pages doesn't mean only 2 functions ... unless you count
all methods for a generic only as one function.

There will be a new release of pixmap next week which contains a
complete rewrite of the code using the methods package, hence it
might not be worth the effort.

Argh.  Not listed under portable shell programming in the Autoconf
manual ...

Otoh, my SysV 7th ed man pages from 79 do not list '-nt' etc, so maybe
we should not use it.  Peter, can you perhaps try rewriting the simple

        if test $(top_builddir)/library/$${pkg} -nt "$@" ; then \

in tests/Examples/Makefile.in using find -newer (which is already in the
7th edition)?

This is something that I have not seen in earlier beta versions of 1.6.0:

That is, the recommened packages are not installed.

I traced this down to the solaris version of make (gmake works fine).

I think the solaris version has problem with the "_tgz" suffixes!

Subject: Install with 64-bit GCC 3.2 (PR#2048)
Message-ID: <200209201634.SAA01188@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Hi,

been trying to build R-1.5.1 for som eof our users here.

No probs with gcc-3.2 32-bit installtion, but thought we'd try it with
the 64-bit just for the crack.

Configuring thus

CC=gcc3 CFLAGS="-m64" CXX=g++3 CXXFLAGS="-m64" F77=g773 FFLAGS="-m64"
LDFLAGS="-m64 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9" ./configure
--prefix=/usr/local/packages/R-1.5.1-64bit

runs OK, however one of the tests (I assume it is a test anyway) fails thus

gcc3 -G  -o ctest.so ansari.o chisqsim.o d2x2xk.o fexact.o kendall.o ks.o  prho.o swilk.o init.o  -L/usr/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2 -L/usr/ccs/bin/sparcv9 -L/usr/ccs/bin -L/usr/ccs/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/ccs/lib -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/../../../sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/../../.. -L/lib/sparcv9 -ldl -ltermcap -lfrtbegin -lg2c -lm -lgcc_s_sparcv9   
ld: fatal: file ansari.o: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to ctest.so
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `ctest.so'
Current working directory /usr/local/packages/src/R-1.5.1/src/library/ctest/src


It appears the make process is not passing the "-m64" flag down from
the LDFLAGS variable as set when running configure.

I have tried a compilation by hand adding this flag to the link stage
and the above compilation goes completes.


Hoping this of use,

I was able to get it all to compile by altering the
src_dir/etc/Makeconf file so that the shared lib LD flags
variables contain -m64

SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS = -G -m64

SHLIB_LDFLAGS = -G -m64

these only had "-G" by default.

Dunno why they dont pick them up as part of the standard configure
though - one for you I guess !

I built it myself. I checked with my Debian system at home, and,
interestingly, there 'dtrmm_' is loaded. Then I reinstalled R-1.5.1, and
'dtrmm_' is still missing! So I get different results on different
_machines_, not different versions of R. I have different setups of atlas
on the two machines. Can that be the cause? Note that not all BLAS
routines are missing, only a selected few. I configure with

./configure --with-gnome --enable-R-shlib

Hmm. On Franz (alias cvs.r-project.org) I seem to be linking against
this guy

[pd@franz pd]$ file /usr/lib/3dnow/atlas/libblas.so.2.3
/usr/lib/3dnow/atlas/libblas.so.2.3: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object,
Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), stripped
                               ********

Could that have something to do with it? The corresponding .a file
does have various incarnations of dtrmm inside.

I'd think so.

I also use --with-blas=blas, but that has in part to do with the magic of
giving you Atlas when you have it installed, and blas if you don't. In other
word the Debian packages depends on a subset (default Blas) which can be
enhanced by installing either the default non-cpu-optimised atlas2-base, or
by installing a cpu-optimised atlas package like atlas2-3dnow for Athlons.
It is a fairly flexible scheme, which out Atlas maintainer developed.

But in short, yes, your Atlas setup on your machine will most likely govern
all of that. If you want a particular feature, I suspect it would help to be
explicit with configure.

I tried that, without success. In fact, no blas library is found, acording
to 'ldd R.bin'. I have

/usr/lib/sse/atlas
/usr/lib/sse

in ld.so.conf and I have run 'ldconfig'. I don't understand why atlas
isn't picked up.

One way for you to make your life easier would be to 

  a) simply install the existing 1.6.0.beta package(s), or 

  b) rebuild it locally as its Build-Depends ought to imply the same
     structure that works for me as well as for eleven build daemons on
     other architectures. 

I suggest we continue this in private mail. Let me know how I can help.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Actually, I think the problem is already fixed for 1.6.0.  Can you pls
try a current R 1.6.0 beta snapshot?

Subject: socket bug ??? (PR#2056)
Message-ID: <200209231430.QAA16928@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Please help me,

I use R-1.4.1 and everything works fine. But with R-1.5.1 ist does'nt work:

I have this put into a file called "socket.R"

while(TRUE){
con1 <- socketConnection(host="localhost",port=6021,server=TRUE);
source(con1);
close(con1);
}


So I can use R with:

source("socket.R")

and R answers me when I send a command to it via socket 6021. But in version 
1.5.1 it does'nt work. Have you any idea?

Many thanks

Ralf Wieland

Subject: Rgui.exe crashes on startup (PR#2058)

I have installed R-1.5.1 using SetupR.exe on both my home laptop (Sony Vaio
running Window XP Home) and in office (Compaq AP550 running Window NT 4.0), but
they shared the same problem. Both worked for a while, but then Rgui.exe crashed
on the startup, complains:

The exception Floating-point invalid operation.
(0xc0000090) occurred in the application at location 0x00435c10.

Despite repeated uninstalled-reboot-install, the crash still persists? Somehow R
remembers it was installed on the machine before, since I can find a new machine
and it will installed and work, but after a while (usually a reboot) it crashes
on startup...

You may need to add blocking=TRUE to the call.  When I do that I can
connect by telnet and send commands (although they aren't run until I
close the connection.)

If you start it with the command line option "--vanilla", it will skip
a lot of automatically executed code at the beginning.  Could you try
that and see if it fixes the problem?

If so, then it might be worth narrowing down which part is
responsible, by adding the individual options one at a time:
--no-save, --no-restore, --no-site-file, --no-init-file
and --no-environ.

If --vanilla has no effect, then it might just be a coincidence that
it works at first.  The usual culprit for spurious floating point
exceptions is code that plays around with the floating point control
word, and doesn't restore it properly.  Many buggy video drivers do
this, for instance.  I could send you some code that detects this bug,
but it's hard to determine what software caused it.

Thanks, Duncan, for your help. I have tried each of the suggestions:

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --vanilla

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-save

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-restore

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-site-file

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-init-file

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-environ

Each case results in the same crash. By the way, how do I restore the
"floating point control word" ? I don't intentionally run video on my
desktop, but maybe something like in real player/ms media player...

Thanks again

Zhen

After starting R, when I give a graphic command (e.g. barplot, plot, etc.) R
crashes with the comment from Windows "Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be
closed by Windows. . . . "  I have tried reinstalling msvcrt.dll in the \bin
directory (FAQ 2.14) but to no avail.

Many thanks

By the way, I have found the offending application: it is a virtual screen
manager called JSP2. As soon as deinstalled it, R works just fine.

Hopefully this will help other people may have similar problems.

Thanks again for your help,

Strange. Try to start R with --vanilla. Does the error persist?

Two bugs here, one trivial: The error message should say B, not A. The
(slightly) less trivial one is that b needs conversion to matrix for
the underlying Lapack routine to work:

Confirmed. The Problem is the wrong error message in the underlying C
code, file .../src/modules/lapack/Lapack.c, line 303:
    error("A must be a complex matrix");
must be changed to
    error("B must be a complex matrix");

Thanks, I can live with that, but for conformance with the man page and
with splus (3.4) it would be nice if B could be a (complex) vector.

Subject: split.screen problem (PR#2069)
Message-ID: <200209261737.TAA21302@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Chris Bodily
Version: 1.5.1
OS: W2K
Submission from: (NULL) (63.106.106.2)


I took the following code directly from the 'split.screen' help page in R and
modified one line to highlight the problem I encountered.  Basically, it appears
that when plotting in split screens and attempting to return to a particular
screen to add or update points, the axes from the original plot are not
remembered, causing the new points to plot incorrectly.
 
A workaround seem to be storing the original plot range and issuing
'plot(x,y,type="n")' where x and y are data vectors with ranges that match the
original plot in the screen of interest.  Then a 'points' command draws in the
correct locations.
 
I found this by moving working code from S-Plus 2000 into R v1.5.1 and noticed
that a particular interactive plot I use began drawing incorrectly.
 
Thanks,
 
Chris Bodily

Subject: rsync.r-project.org and cran.us.r-project.org
Message-ID: <6radm48jb1.fsf@bates3.stat.wisc.edu>

Around noon Wednesday, Sept 25, the machine that serves as
rsync.r-project.org and cran.us.r-project.org had a catastrophic disk
failure.  I came back to my office after a lecture and immediately
thought "I don't think disk drives are supposed to make grinding
noises".  :-)

It was the drive with the system files that failed.  Most user files
and the CRAN archive (not to mention the CVS archive) are on another
drive that is running fine.  However, we did have to build and install
the operating system from scratch then reinstall the files from the
backups.

Many people provided a great deal of help and we now have that
computer running.  I believe that rsync services and the CRAN mirror
are running as expected.  Be aware that they have not been updated
since early Wednesday morning (U.S. Central Time).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0209010823180.5400-100000@gannet.stats>

The help page is correct: please read it more carefully:

     `gc' returns a matrix with rows `"Ncells"' (cons cells, usually 28
     bytes each on 32-bit systems and 56 bytes on 64-bit systems, and
     `"Vcells"' (vector cells, 8 bytes each), and columns `"used"' and
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    `"gc trigger"', each also interpreted in megabytes (rounded up to
     the next 0.1Mb).

`30158416 bytes' is your invention: gc() actually reports `30158416
Vcells'.

It *is* matrix as stated, and not a list!

This looks like a problem with package dependencies.  Should be sending this to
the 
package author, not r-bugs?


An attempt to install lattice from the windows binary runs OK, but attempting to
load the library an error occurs:

> install.packages("D:/Software/R/lattice.zip", .lib.loc[1], CRAN = NULL)
updating HTML package descriptions
> library(lattice)
Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt) : syntax error on line 2022

I then tried installing under linux with R 1.5.1

This installed OK, but loading the library gave another error:

> library(lattice)
Error in library(grid) : There is no package called `grid'

Installing grid on linux resulted in lattice loading and working properly

Installing grid also fixed the problem on windows.

It *is* package dependency, exactly.  lattice is wholly dependent upon grid,
so, in short,
no grid, no lattice.  On windows, I believe the installation of binary
packages simply unzip the package zip file(s) to the appropriate folder.  No
checks for dependency until loading time.

To R-devel:  Can package dependencies be checked at installed time, at least
for source packages?

1.4.0.  grid depends critically on the R version, so don't change it
unless you know exactly what you are doing.

library() in  1.6.0 will do a lot more checks of the package to be loaded.

Nope.  What packages are available depends on the current .libPaths(),
hence can only be known at load time.  There has been a long-term plan
that installing a package would also install its dependencies, but
the dynamic nature of R libraries (the dirs in which packages are
installed) makes this tricky.

Subject: Rwave installation problem (PR#1974)
Message-ID: <200209020727.JAA27891@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Linc Davis
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Mac OS 10.1.5
Submission from: (NULL) (68.4.90.94)


When running install.packages("Rwave") as root, I got this error:

In file included from compinteg.c:12:
kernel.h:22: malloc.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [compinteg.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'Rwave'

There are 3 header files 'malloc.h' in Mac OS X: one for generic C, one for
Objective-C, and a private one for the OS. The R installation script looks for C
headers in /usr/include, but the actual path to this one is

/usr/include/sys/malloc.h

I worked around the problem by copying the file as indicated, then I deleted the
copy after compiling the package. To fix the bug, the script should be changed
to look for C headers in both /usr/include and /usr/include/sys.

Thanks.

Subject: matrices and arrays loose dimension after multiplying with scalar (PR#1979)
Message-ID: <200209031545.RAA14954@pubhealth.ku.dk>

A matrix or array with one of its dimensions having zero elements looses its
dimension after multiplying with scalar.
Admittedly this is an extreme case, however it DOES make sense to retain an
objects formal structure after multiplying with a scalar, as e.g. a matrix
with zero rows IS a legal object in S. BTW, the prototype does retain the
dimension.

Danke, Jens!

o still happens in R-devel (aka 1.6.0 "unstable") of today.

o yes, it's a bug  though not a high-priority one {and we are
  approaching deep feature freeze real soon now...}

Subject: t(xmax)
Message-ID: <3D77613F.31B79516@bank-banque-canada.ca>

Extending a recent R help discussion:

> xmat2 <- ts(matrix(rnorm(100),ncol=2))
> end(t(xmat2))
 [1] 50  1
# this implies 50 periods of data
> dim(t(xmat2))
 [1]  2 50
# this implies 2 periods of data on 50 series

(In R 1.5.1 on Solaris.) I think this should be considered a bug in t(),
which probably should not preserve ts attributes. I will file it as a
bug unless there are other opinions. I guess there are other
possibilities (such as, the documentation for the structure of a ts
should be changed), but I think t() preserving the mts and ts class and
attributes will probably break lots of other things.

Hi,

 I am not sure if this is a bug in layout or I am doing something silly.
 If it is a bug I will file a proper report.

here goes:

plot.new()
old.pars<-par()

 #try to divide the device into a big and small component
 layout(matrix(c(1,2),1,2),widths=c(lcm((old.pars$pin[1]-1)*2.2),lcm(2.2)))
 lay.pars<-par()
 names(old.pars)[!old.pars%in%lay.pars]
 [1] "cxy"   "fig"   "mfcol" "mfg"   "mfrow" "pin"   "plt"
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] -0.2828187  5.2876886
 #Huh? should this be negative?
 dev.off()
 plot.new()
 layout(matrix(c(1,2),1,2),widths=c(5,1))
 lay.pars<-par()
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] 0.01610944 5.28768865
 plot.new()
 lay.pars<-par()
 lay.pars$pin
 [1] 4.676389 5.287689
 Reverse of what I would have thought.
 
 Thanks
 Nicholas

Because the "current plot" at this point is the second (narrower) plot
(see below), which does not actually have room for a plot (the margins
are wider than the total width allocated so the plot region is
negative).  If at this point you type "plot.new()" twice, the second
call will give an error complaining about margins being too big.

R keeps an index of which plot it is up to.  The index runs from 1 to
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.  Whenever plot.new() is called,
this index is incremented by 1 and it wraps back to 1 when it exceeds
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.

When you call layout() it sets the "current" plot region to be
number-of-plots-to-appear-on-the-page.  Note that the first thing that
must happen before any drawing can occur is a call to plot.new().  Then
when you call plot.new() it tries to go to the "next plot" which adds 1
to the "current plot" counter, which wraps back around to 1.  

I think what is causing most confusion here is the fact that the call to
layout() is setting things up ready for the next call to plot.new(),
which in turn sets everything up ready for the actual graphical output
to occur (via axes(), lines(), ...).

The short answer:  no it is not a bug :)

Hope that helps.

Paul

Subject: explict sharing of symbols between packages
Message-ID: <3D786605.92B582FE@csiro.au>

Hi everyone,

I'm thinking about breaking up a large package I have to
avoid loading some of the more specialised parts when it
isn't necessary.

The package is dependent on shared libraries. The base one
will keep all of the core stuff like constructors etc and
the specialised parts will need to access these. It is
obviously possible to set the "local" flag to false, however
this becomes a dangerous, especially with the larger
package.

Is there any way to define a group of packages that share a
symbol table? That would seem to me to be a possible
solution.

Can anyone offer advice on this?

Thanks

Are you talking about the R symbol table, or the symbol table in the
dynamically linked libraries? 

If the former, then (until namespaces are implemented) they *always*
share symbol tables.  Every routine can see every other routine.

Your comment about a "local" flag makes me think you're talking about
an external library.  This may be system dependent.  In Windows it's
not possible to do what you want to do.  A DLL exports certain
symbols, and there's no way to merge that table with the table from
another DLL.  However, it is normal to import routines specifying both
the routine name and which DLL they come from, so name clashes don't
need to be a problem.

This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

I have partially fixed this bug. Now arithmetic works fine but I still 
have problems with TZ, i.e.

 > a=strptime("2002-06-01 12:15:01","%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
 > a
[1] "2002-06-01 12:15:01"
 > a+0
[1] "2002-06-01 05:15:01"
 > a+3600
[1] "2002-06-01 06:15:01"
 > b=c(a)
 > b
[1] "2002-06-01 05:15:01"

TZ is set to +0100 dy default on the Carbon R.

if, e.g., libgnomeui.a is not present, the build for a --with-gnome
configuration will fail.  (for my plain RH 7.2 a number of *-devel-*

gnome-libs-devel,  gtk+-devel, glib-devel, libglade-devel.)

Subject: bug in layout?
In-Reply-To: <3D78061A.E99CC336@stat.auckland.ac.nz>

Hi,
I think I am beginning to understand how this works, but obviously not
fully. layout changes the following pars
[1] "cxy"  "fig"  "fin"  "mfg"  "pin"  "plt"  "usr"  "xaxp" "yaxp"

and as you state below moves the counter to N so after layout is called
if par is called one gets the pars for the Nth plot. Now after a call to
plot.new() the counter is set to 1 and a call to par gets the pars() for
the current plot.

what if I have a call to layout in a function, and i want to alter the
parameter "pin" in the first plot? Advancing through using plot.new()
does not seem to work because pin gets set each time the frame advances.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Nicholas

Did you run tools/rsync-recommended? (See

(Vince, I'd appreciate a slightly longer fuse before having *changes*
in the build procedure for the development version show up on the
public bug lists. You might have asked R-core.)

Subject: explict sharing of symbols between packages
In-Reply-To: <3D786605.92B582FE@csiro.au>; from Richard.Beare@csiro.au on Fri, Sep 06, 2002 at 06:23:33PM +1000

Hi Richard.

 This issue arises reasonably often. Doug Bates has brought it up on a
few occassions, specifically related to packages that want to use
routines that are located in R modules (lapack). And many of the
Omegahat packages are naturally split into different packages that
share a set of common routines. 

As you point out, you can use 
   dyn.load("foo.so", local = FALSE)
to get the symbols in foo.so directly into 
the global symbol table and make them available
to other dynamically loaded code.
This can introduce a whole range of other problems

There are a few different approaches you can use.

a) Put the common code into a native library (e.g. libCommon.a or libCommon.so)
 and then arrange to have each of the packages that use these routines
 link against this. For Windows, you will explicitly export the symbols
 that are to be shared from this library.

 In this model, the library of common routines (libCommon.so) is not
 used dynamically loaded by R. Instead is one step removed, being
 linked into .so's or .dll's that are.

 This is probably the most practical approach. However, it will require
 that you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or PATH on Windows) variable
 to include the directory containing libCommon.so/dll so that the dynamic loader
 can find it at run time.

 Also, if you use global variables in the common library, some systems
 require coaxing to ensure that there is only one instance of those variables
 shared across all the different libraries.


b) If you really want to have 



I have some example packages that illustrate this.  If there is
interest, I will tidy them up and write up a more complete description
of the different approaches.

Kurt Hornik and I have agreed to implement a mechanism after R 1.6 is
released.  It will probably use one or more of these approaches and
make them much easier.

Oops. Thought I was postponing that mail and sent it instead.
So here is the alternative approach, i.e. b)

Rather than use the linker to connect the calls to the common routines
and their definitions in a secondary library (e.g. libCommon.so), you
can resolve and set the symbols yourself.  Specifically, you use
function pointers in the code that calls the shared routines and then
when you load the packages, you arrange to have these variables refer
to the actual routines that you want.

For example, suppose we have two packages - A and B and A has a
routine named foo() that we want to call in the routine bar() located
in B.

So A.c has
void
foo(void)  {
  ...
}

And B.c has

void (*foo_ptr)(void);

void 
bar()
{
  /* Want to call bar() */
 (*foo_ptr)();
}

Given this setup, you need to have an initialization
routine in B.c that sets the value of the variable foo_ptr.
There are two ways to do this.
You can call R_FindSymbol() within C code.

Using the initialization routine in package B
void R_init_B(DllInfo *dll)
{
   foo_ptr = R_FindSymbol("foo", "A", NULL);
}


Alternatively, you can do the lookup in R and pass
the address of foo() as an argument to a routine in B.

a <- getNativeSymbolInfo("foo", PACKAGE = "A")
.Call("setFoo", a,  PACKAGE = "B")

And the C routine setFoo()  looks something like

SEXP setFoo(SEXP address)
{
  foo_ptr = R_ExternalPtrAddr(address);
  return(R_NilValue);
}


This approach, compared to linking libraries, allows you to
dynamically change routines. This can be useful but is probably
overkill for your example. However, this approach does not rely 
on linkers idiosyncrasies.

 Hope this helps.

  D.

Subject: No reorder.factor in R
Message-ID: <C71CB7425639D311A7A40008C7286AB006A54FBF@carina.phibred.com>


I was using R 1.5.1 today with an old script from S-Plus and discovered that
R does not have reorder.factor.  

It's a very simple function, but very handy for re-arranging factors in
lattice graphics (among other places).  Would it make sense to add this
function to the base code
in order to increase compatability with S-Plus and add additional
functionality?

reorder.factor <- function(fac, y, fun=mean, ...){
  ordered(fac, levels=levels(fac)[order(tapply(y, fac, fun, ...))])
}

reorder.factor is part of Trellis and I believe little used elsewhere.
That makes it a prime candidate for lattice.

I always thought it should be called `order.factor' as factors are not
normally ordered (although Trellis assumes they are).

Forwarded to r-devel since it is a slight change of topic

 - it seems that it might be worth considering putting two special
 variables into the lapply/sapply environment,
   .currentIndex and .currentTag 

  - these are both hard to get right now, and the solutions that
 people are finding, seem to depend on the order in which the lapply
 is applied (that might change -- also, if we get some form of
 parallelism going this solution should be nicer).

Use

lapply(seq(along=lst).  function(i, vec, lst){body}, vec=vec, lst=lst)

using the index i in the body.

Or just use a for loop.

Subject: R 1.6.0 beta
Message-ID: <x2ptvlub4i.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>

R 1.6.0 has gone into final feature freeze as of today.

As a new feature, we'll make interim beta versions available via

ftp://cran.us.r-project.org/pub/R/src/base

alias 

http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base

(filename R-1.6.0beta_*.tar.gz, where * is the creation date). 

If you want to help ensure that the final 1.6.0 works satisfactorily
on *your* platform, it might be a good idea to make a test build of
the beta and report any errors back. 

The plan is to make versions daily, although some days might be
skipped if the build script fails.

We now bundle the recommended packages with the base sources.

--------------
The procedure for building and testing everything can be as simple as
 
<unpack sources> 
cd R-1.6.0 
./configure && make && make fullcheck 

(Make fullcheck can take a long time, especially in the boot and nlme
packages).

The current version in known to pass the checks for our Linux/x86
systems but has two known problems on Solaris/gcc: An optimizer bug in
gcc 3.0.3 causing "cluster" to fail in mona.f and a convergence issue
with the glns example in nlme.

Subject: Old-style classes: bug fix & request
Message-ID: <3D7E13E5.2002332@research.bell-labs.com>

Bug fix:

A bug introduced in version 1.6 failed to "initialize" some old-style
(aka "S3") classes, producing possible warning messages if those classes
were used in the signature of a method in the methods package.

The real bug, though, was that old-style inheritance could not be
included, until the setOldClass function was provided.  Initializing the
methods package now defines a number of old-style classes, some with
inheritance.

The bug & its fix are only relevant if you want to use old-style classes
in defining formal methods.

Request:

The request is for input on other classes that need to be included or
currently included classes not treated correctly.

Roughly, if there is an assignment of class in the base package that
does not break the consistency of classes, we should initialize that
class or classes via a call to setOldClass.  The discussion in
"Programming with Data", pp 449-451 covers some of the issues.

The list of old-style classes processed is in .OldClassesList in the
methods package.  Elements of the list are character vectors; each is
used in a call to setOldClass during initialization.  So elements of the
list with > 1 string define old-style inheritance.

There are a few known classes in the base package NOT currently
initialized:

- "noquote": The use of the "noquote" class breaks the class model
because it inserts a class name _after_ an arbitrary other class name,
changing the hierarchy from one object to another.  Can't be
consistently used in setOldClass.

- "listof" and "list.of".  It wasn't clear whether these are different
and if so, whether both should be included.

Ideally, we would like the call to setOldClass to be associated with the
package that uses the S3 class, but to do so requires using the methods
package in initializing the other package.

For the moment, the proposal is to handle in the methods package the
old-style classes in the base package.  For other packages, we need a
different solution.

Keeping with the practice of the last two full releases, I took the 20020910 
tarball, and the rec'ed packages, last night and made Debian packages for the
unstable distribution.  I intend to update these weekly before Oct. 1 to ensure
that they do not migrate into testing yet as Debian's unstable is the appropriate
environment for these packages.

The build daemons have already caught up. The page
   http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=r-base
has links to the full build logs on all arches.  As of right now, we already 
have  
   alpha, arm hppa, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, sparc, s390
With the exception of arm, all run (and pass) "make check". Arm has a long-
standing fpu bug which is triggered by one test.

I made a small blunder. I had previously used a naming scheme like e.g.
1.4.1.cvsYYYYMMDD for the 1.5.0 pre-release.  This time I wanted to signal the
1.6.0 nature of the release and picked 1.6.0.rc.20020910  -- but that sorts 
higher than 1.6.0, so I will need to use 1.6.0.rel or 1.6.0.release on October 1.
I hope you're not to offended by this deviation from the simpler "1.6.0" .

Subject: setGeneric(); R CMD check
Message-ID: <20020910150946.B2319@jessie.research.bell-labs.com>

1. Is it always the case that when defining generic functions in
   a package, the package needs to be installed as a binary package
   to avoid having the generic functions in the .GlobalEnv?

2. Defining a generic function in a "non-binary" package triggers 
   a check warning

     $ R CMD check ...
     ...
     * checking for code/documentation mismatches ... WARNING
     Objects with usage in documentation object 'dbApply' but missing from code:
     [1] "dbApply"

   It seems that the generic function dbApply lives in the .GlobalEnv when
   the package is attached (w. library), but not in the package's environment.
   I presume that's why check triggers the warning.

   Is this the case?

*If* this is the case (i.e., packages with setGeneric()s need to be installed
as binaries), perhaps it should be documented somewhere.

... or am I missing something very basic?

Hmm? Which "make" are you using? It's not supposed to start processing
recommended packages until after all the base ones and the specific
tests.

One should be made as part of the make process.


One thing that doesn't quite look right in the Makefile is the

Makedeps: Makefile
        @(for p in $(R_PKGS_BASE); do \
            dep="$${p}-Ex.Rout: $${p}-Ex.R"; \
            dep="$${dep} \$$(top_builddir)/library/$${p}/R/$${p}"; \
            tmp="library/$${p}/libs/$${p}" ; \

Maybe that should be 

        @(for p in $(R_PKGS_BASE) $(R_PKGS_RECOMMENDED_EXPANDED); do \
        <...etc...>

Could you try and see if it helps?

I have successfully compiled it under Windows XP.

Though, as a side track.  I compiled it under Inno Setup 3.0.3-beta.  In the
3.x version, "AlwaysCreateUninstallIcon" is no longer supported.  I had to
deleted the line (Line 12, I believe), added :
    Name: "{group}\R 1.6.0 beta"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"
into the [Icons] block..  I think one can compile without adding in this
line, but the "AlwaysCreateUninstallIcon" must be removed.  (I know this
version of Inno Setup is still at beta stage, but it seems this "feature" is
going to stay :-)).

The resulting installation file, rw1060.exe, is roughly 16.3MB, without
compiled HTML support (I didn't built it).

Thought this may interest some people :-)

Subject: vecLib
Message-ID: <084F0DE2-C548-11D6-8A95-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

Mac OS X 10.2 comes with /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework,
which contains Altivec optimized versions of LAPACK, BLAS (and of
libraries for Digital Signal Processing and BigNums, and a vector
version of the scalar libm). All this is either 8, 16, or 32 bit signed  
and
unsigned integers, or single precision IEEE floating point.

Browse it:   <developer.apple.com/hardware/ve>

Code it:      /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/

Include it:  #include   <vecLib/vecLib.h>

Do it:         cc -faltivec -framework vecLib file.c

Although the use of single precision FP may be a problem for
building all of R, this framework could obviously be used to build
some wickedly fast DSP and linear algebra packages.

You might be a bit alone there, but on the other hand, cygwin and the
autotools are meant to play nicely with each other, so what happens if
you just try? I'd expect that you'll get a few hiccups from things
like #ifdef Win32 implying !Unix but most should compile cleanly. (I
believe I had configure+make working under Cygwin about 4 or 5 years
ago (no X11, obviously), but "lots of water has been passed under the
bridge" since then).

Actually it's not even true for Solaris. I got a sense of deja vu,
looked through my install logs, and found that I had *deleted*
libreadline.so because it conflicted with gcc 3.0.1 when building R
(this was almost exactly a year ago on Sep 10, 2001; the events of the
following day might have dislodged things from my memory!)

That is of course still a possible workaround... 
Or downgrading to gcc 2.95.3, which seems more and more attractive
given all the trouble with gcc 3.x.

I think we'll switch to Inno Setup 3 when it's released.  I'm
especially hoping for the "install from the net" option to be
implemented; that should allow us to include optional TCL/TK
installation, without increasing the size of the distributable by 9
Meg for everyone.

The change you suggested looks like it would be compatible with Inno
2; I'll take a look.

Subject: rhome.c: getRHOME() fails, if R is called from SJava (PR#2003)
Message-ID: <200209111317.PAA14882@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Heinz Grimm
Version: R1.5.1
OS: Windows NT 4.0
Submission from: (NULL) (195.65.178.178)


The R error message is:
"Fatal error: Unable to open base package"

The reason is:
getRHome() returns e.g. d:/r-project/R-1.5.1 if called within R (correct)

getRHome() returns e.g. D:/jdk1.3.1_01/jre if R is called from SJava (0.65),
hence
R tries to load the base library from D:/jdk1.3.1_01/jre/library/base/R/base
(very
bad)

I have modified $R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/rhome.c in this way:

char *getRHOME()
{
    char *RHome;

    RHome = getenv("R_HOME");
    if(!RHome)
    {
      RHome = getenv("RHOME");
    }
    if(!RHome)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "No R_HOME environment variable value\n");fflush(stderr);
      exit(1);
    }
    strcpy( rhomebuf, RHome);
    return (rhomebuf);
}

now it works fine!

By "binary", meaning "INSTALL --save" or equivalent?

Yes, and the symptom you mentioned is rather mild, compared to what will
often happen!  Any of the computations that default to assigning
metadata to the global environment will cause problems (setMethod,
setClass, ...) in a default installation, unless all such computations
are wrapped in a function call that can be re-directed from the
.First.lib function to the correct environment.

It's not likely to be worth the effort.

For the present version of R, the simplest approach is probably for the
programmer to arrange for an installation with a saved image, either
through the option to INSTALL or by putting a file "install.R" (an empty
file will do) in the top source directory of the package.

For the next version, we should try to make the process more automatic,
although the only way that would always work seems to be by making
--save the default to INSTALL.

...................

As mentioned, the "CMD check"  problem may be the least of it!

The following snippet will _apparently_ install with or without --save:

### Dummy Package
require("methods")

foo <- function(x)x

setGeneric("foo")

setMethod("foo", "character", function(x) paste("++", x))
###

But in the default install, it fails (annoyingly) when the library is
attached, because the assignment of foo is not in the search list, so
setGeneric doesn't find any definition of "foo".


R> library(DummyPackage)
Loading required package: methods 
Error in setGeneric("foo") : Must supply a function skeleton, explicitly
or via an existing function


It's possible to work around most of the specific problems, but my
feeling is that the natural semantics for the programmer is that  the
same source code should work basically the same way, whether being
sourced into the global environment for initial testing or being
installed as a package.

Yes.  I'll add it to the online help for INSTALL (& the extensions
document?).

By the way, an additional annoyance is that even with --SAVE, this
doesn't quite work always, because the `require("methods")' is only
active at INSTALL time, not when the image is loaded.  It would be nice
to make this carry over automatically as well, but how?

For now, the programmer needs to include the require("methods") in a
First.lib function in the package.

Just to wrap up this thread, for now.

A section has been added to ?INSTALL with hints on installing packages
that use the methods package:

     Packages that require the methods package, and that use functions
     such as `setMethod' or `setClass', should be installed by creating
     a binary image.

     The package should require the methods package, both during
     installation and when the user attaches the package.  A good
     solution for most cases is to include the line
     `require("methods")' twice, once at the beginning of the package's
     R source, and once in the file `install.R' in the package
     directory (the top-level directory, not in the `R' directory below
     that).  The `install.R' file causes an image to be saved, and the
     contents will ensure that methods are available when the package
     is attached.

The suggestions seem to work, at least on some simple tests.  I'm not
aware of situations where this fails, but let me know otherwise.

The documentation should be in the next beta or rsync,  also in the
windows INSTALL help file (but I don't have a way to test that), plus a
pointer in the R-exts document to the online help page.

This doesn't work in the currently released version, because it
doesn't define {uninstallexe}.  I'll leave the install script as is;
once Inno Setup 3 is released, I'll look at the benefits of switching
over to it. Certainly there won't be any change before the 1.6.0
release.

John, 

Thanks for the solution.

Your suggestion seems to work quite nicely and the added paragraphs
to help(INSTALL) are clear.  However, it seems that most people will
not be aware of this issue, and if and when they stumble into it,
looking at ?INSTALL may not be their first thought.  I'm wondering
if it would be helpful to include a similar description (or point to
?INSTALL) in, say, "Writing R Extensions", and/or ?setMethod, etc.?
A line in the Release Notes may also be helpful?

Subject: R 1.6.0 beta
Message-ID: <3D7FA193.5050107@univie.ac.at>

I did a test run of compiling R 1.6.0
I got an error when compiling the recommended packages:

C:\devel\R-1.6.0\src\gnuwin32>make recommended
--- Unpacking recommended packages
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../library/VR/DESCRIPTION'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../library/KernSmooth/DESCRIPTION'. 
  Stop.
......................... some more lines for the other libraries
make: *** [unpack-recommended] Error 2

I noticed that the Makefile in gnuwin32 contains the following lines

../library/%/DESCRIPTION: ../library/RECOMMENDED/%_tgz
	@echo "---- $*"
	(cd ../library; tar zxf Recommended/$*_tgz; touch $@)

but the files in src/library/Recommended
have extensions .tar.gz

is that connected with the problem?

I compiled on win2k

Is this error my fault, did I overlook something?

A confirmation:
Now setting

options(htmlhelp=TRUE,browser="C:\\Program Files\\Internet 
Explorer\\IEXPLORE.EXE")

in etc\Rprofile
also controls which browser is used when help is called from the menu item.

In the tar file all the foo_tgz's are symbolic links to
foo_7.9-13.tar.gz etc. Now, Windows doesn't have symlinks...

You probably have a tar that ignores symbolic links. I believe Brian's 
creates an extra copy of the file. 

The symlinks offered a quick solution to the problem of keeping track
of dependencies on files that change not only their timestamps but
also their name.  (Relevant for the core developers and people who
build from the rsync snapshots.)  I suspect there's a better way, I
just didn't see it before feature freeze...

Subject: Startup/Initialization Memory Leak in R
Message-ID: <5.1.1.5.2.20020911210204.00ac4270@pop.prism.gatech.edu>

    Is it already known that R does not free the memory that it allocates 
during start-up (~10MB) when it exits?  If so, are there currently any 
plans to address this problem?  I noticed that the 1.6.0 beta leaks 
slightly more memory (~300k) than the 1.5.1 stable version.

    I am working on a project that links with the R library, and there is a 
question about unloading and later re-loading the R library, so this memory 
leak could become a real issue.

Thank you.

Hi,

I have updated the chapter on Compile R from Source in my R for Windows
Users guide.  I'm not planning on officially releasing it until R 1.6.0 is
officially released, but if you want a sneak preview of the chapter, you may
get it from http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/pub/R/WinBook/ch4.pdf .
It is targeted at the final official version of R 1.6.0, but should work for
the current beta version too.

A minor point, I just discovered that (while updating the guide) the
R-1.6.0/src/gnuwin32/INSTALL file, Line 56, has a spelling mistake.
prce-3.9.tar.bz2 should be pcre-3.9.tar.bz2 .

Cheers,

Ko-Kang Wang

Hi Kurt

I currently have on my Mac gcc 2.95.2, 3.1, and 3.3 and the
corresponding g77 versions as well. R builds fine with
the 2.95.2 combo, it also builds fine with gcc 2.95.2 and
g77 3.1. But using gcc 3.1 or gcc 3.3 gives the familiar
problem that I mentioned before (although the 3.1
combination does build scilab and octave fine).

checking for dummy main to link with Fortran 77 libraries... unknown
configure: error: linking to Fortran libraries from C fails

I include the config.log for the build with gcc 2.95.2 and g77 3.1
(which works) and for the one with gcc 3.1 and g77 3.1, which fails.

Is that configure test, the one that fails, really needed ?

By the way, gcc 3.1 with f2c also works -- but that fails to build
some packages such as splancs and subselect.

More by the way, gcc 3.1 and 2.95.2 come with OS X, g77 3.1
and 2.95.2 come from fink, gcc 3.3 and g77 3.3 come from Apple's
CVS. f2c also from fink.

Subject: R-1.6.0-beta compiling on Solaris with gcc-3.2
Message-ID: <3D80380E.6EDB0682@statistik.uni-dortmund.de>

Compiling R-1.6.0-beta (or any other) with gcc-3.2 just with

 ./configure
 make

 ... works - great!


But there are these annoying warning messages after *each* call to any
of the gcc tools, as in:

 gcc -I. -I../../src/include -I../../src/include -I/usr/local/include 
   -DHAVE_CONFIG_H   -g -O2 -c phyper.c -o phyper.o
 cc1: warning: changing search order for system directory 
   "/usr/local/include"
 cc1: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system 
   directory

I am not really sure if there is something special with our system?
If not, is it possible to solve that in the configure script for a later
version of R?

Working on a Linux box, I originally found the leak using a memory 
management program that I wrote.  I confirmed the leak using the Valgrind 
program (http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/), which produces a nice 
output.  If you would like, I can post a full or edited output from that 
program.  The majority of the memory is allocated using the GetNewPage 
function in memory.c and appears to still be in the table of allocated 
pages when R exits.

Note that this about initialisation of the R shared library R.so, not the
R executable.

This may need fixing -- with a standalone executable the operating system
will handle memory release when the program exits, but with an R library
dynamically loaded into another process it won't.

OTOH, why do you want to load and unload R lots of times?

I'm a little unclear on what you mean by "when R exits".  R currently
does not have a mechanism for explicitly releasing all its heap
memory.  That is fine when R is run as a process, the original design,
since the OS will release its memory when R exits (normally or
otherwise).  When R is used as a shared library then there is no way
at this point to tell R that you are done with its heap and make sure
it is released. You can build a customized cleanup function and
install it so R_CleanUp calls it, but we currently don't provide a
hook for releasing the heap from that function.  There are other
resources that we do not have convenient means of releasing explicitly
also, such as all loaded shared libraries.  Being able to have
separate R sessions within a single process is something some of us
have talked about and that will require getting a handle on these
issues, but we're not there yet.

process_site_Renviron() doesn't seem to be called anywhere in the
windows sources. Fix:

.../src/gnuwin32/system.c obviously needs (diff'ed to R-1.6.0 beta
(2002-09-10)):

In that case we have to change  .../src/unix/sys-common.c  (?) as well,
because R_Home seems to be empty at this point on Windows. I was not
able to figure out why, maybe Duncan has a better solution?
A quick hack:

I misunderstood the context.  The same problem would likely occur in
Windows if your application uses R.dll.

I agree that this should be fixed in the long term:  one might want to
instantiate multiple copies of R's evaluator in some application (e.g.
a new front-end that ran multiple consoles), and there should be a way
to shut them down and clean up afterwards.  In the meantime, the
workaround is probably to just keep a list of the activated copies,
and when a new one is needed, check if there's an unused one in the
list.  If so, execute some code to clean up the environment, and
re-use it.

R : Copyright 2002, The R Development Core Team
Version 1.6.0 beta (2002-09-11)

Debian/gcc-3.2

Building and fullchecking caused no errors to talk about, but

$ R CMD check my.package

failed on the example. From my.package-Ex.Rout:
....
Error in match.call(definition, call, expand.dots) :
        NULL is not a logical
Execution halted

This does not happen in 1.5.1, and in 1.6.0, if I install my.package
and run the example, it works fine.

yes.
You are using "T" and "F" in your package instead of "TRUE" and "FALSE".
This is now tested a bit (by setting T <- F <- NULL).

NEWS of "R-1.6.0 beta" 
----		       (probably should be read by ``everyone'')	
has

||     o	R CMD check now tests for mis-use on an installed or binary
|| 	package, and sets 'T' and 'F' to 'NULL' when running the examples.

where I'm pretty sure you won't be the only one..

BTW, (not to Göran, but the publich), also in NEWS

||    o	The assignment operator `_' is deprecated: a warning is	given
||	once per R session.

which really suggests to everyone (you should finally listen ;-) ..
your R code might no longer run in the not so distant future (some time
next year probably) when you'll still be using "_" for assignment

Is a file owner or something set wrong in the snapshot?

I tried yesterday's snapshot a few times but had trouble with an
unexpected EOF in the gunzip. This is usually a glitch in the download,
but it happened a couple of times, with both wget and Netscape, so I
suspect the source may have been corrupt.

Brian had already raised this some time ago---Brian, is there an obvious
fix?  If not, then we need a configure check for GCC version 3.2 or
better and inititialize CPPFLAGS accordingly?

Subject: [R] proposal: mosaicplot with sub and las
Message-ID: <20020913105944.A2318@s1x.zimnet.ch>


Two proposals for mosaicplot():

- The argument "sub" should not be ignored.
  Example: mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, sub = 'test of sub' )

- To be able to discern also longer axis labels
  the argument "las" or par(las=2) should not be ignored.
  Example: mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, las=2 )

Thanks

You have just to change three lines in mosaicplot.default(). 
Since you provided a very nice suggestion to improve dotchart()
(THANKS!), please, would you provide a suggestion for this one too?

That will be a bit more difficult than just using las, because
annotation is done by text(), not mtext() nor axis(). One have to
calculate with the las values in the srt argument of the text() calls.
I am sure you will provide a suggestion for the improvement soon. [If
you don't get it to work, just send a private e-mail.]

Well, to answer my own question:

You stupidly forgot to get rid of the directory created the day before,
and the date-stamp file is read only so tar cannot overwrite it. You
should know better. Have a good weekend.

Subject: missing data in stripchart (PR#2018)
Message-ID: <200209141735.TAA07686@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jonathan Baron
Version: 1.5.1
OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (151.201.155.186)


The documentation of stripchart() says that "NA's are allowed in
the data."  I think this would imply that

stripchart(nprob[cancer==4] ~ probtype[cancer==4],meth="stack")

should work even if nprob has a missing datum in the relevant range.
I get the following error message:

Error in xy.coords(x, y) : x and y lengths differ
In addition: Warning message: 
longer object length
is not a multiple of shorter object length in: y + (unlist(xo, use.names =
FALSE) - 1) * offset * csize 

The following works.  There was one missing datum.

stripchart(nprob[cancer==4 & !is.na(nprob)] ~ probtype[cancer==4 &
!is.na(nprob)],meth="stack")

So, either the behavior or the documentation appears to need changing.
I would prefer to change the behavior so it matches the documentation.

In case you want this - and feel free to delete this - here are the
data for the bug I just reported concerning missing data in
stripchart.

You need to run hrp2.R.  Please excuse the extraneous junk.  This was
written mostly by a grad student who was learning R in the process
(Andrea Gurmankin).  She doesn't like to delete things.

Subject: Running Median and Mean
Message-ID: <15749.62506.473601.799299@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

R gurus,

On Aug 20, 2002, I asked in R-help about calculating a running 5-day median on
a large matrix.  Thanks to Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch> and Ray
Brownrigg <Ray.Brownrigg@mcs.vuw.ac.nz> for responding.

I ended up writing C code (and an R interface) to do it, which is about 1000x
faster than the naive method!  (72s became .09s on a 223 x 520 matrix).  I
added a running mean function too, which is very simple and is about 15x
faster than apply(..., filter, ...).  I've packaged the code as
  <http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Devel/runStat_1.1.tar.gz>

The key insight was that it *is* in fact a good idea to calculate the ranks of
the 5 data points, because then it is easy to calculate how those ranks
*change* as you step through the column.  For example, suppose the last few
points in a column look like:
   data=  20 25 18 14 78 55 29
   rank=      3  2  1  5  4
where I have ranked the 5 points prior to the last one.  The median is 25 (the
point with rank 3).  Stepping to the left:
   data=  20 25 18 14 78 55 29
   rank=   3  4  2  1  5
For the 4 points that overlap, their ranks remain the same, except they are
incremented by one for points >=20, and decremented by one for points >55.  The
rank of the new point (20) is just 5 minus the number of increments done.

The code is copied below for your amusement.  Suggestions welcome.  Note I have
not dealt with NA's, even values of N, row-wise medians, or non-lagged medians
(i.e. I put the median of points 1:5 into position 6, not position 5).  It
would be great if somebody (Martin?) wanted to incorporate these functions into
an existing package or even "base"; otherwise I'll post the final product on
CRAN/src/contrib.

I am willing to add these functions into the gregmisc package to complement
the already-existing 'running' function.

{David's a package too}

Note that I said originally,
that I have had code for years (available on request) and
planned to add these to "modreg" (one of the standard packages). 

Further note that I was talking about two algorithms
1) something along the lines David is using,
   where I got the original algorithm from Werner Stuetzle from
   in Fortran (from the 80's).
2) the optimal algorithm of Haerdle & Steiner (and Turlach)
   which can be another order of magnitude faster.

 --> Ref. @article{hae:stei:1995,
       Author = {H\"ardle, W. and Steiger, W.},
       Title = {{O}ptimal Median Smoothing [{Algorithm AS} 296]},
       Year = 1995,
       Journal = {Applied Statistics},
       Volume = 44,
       Pages = {258--264},
   }

I do agree I should have published the code much earlier...

Download CarbonLib from

and put it in your extensions folder and reboot.

Actually, layout() sets par(pin) only if you have not specified it
deliberately.  For example, the following respects the par(pin) setting
...

par(pin=c(1,1))
layout(matrix(c(1,1,0,2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
plot.new()
plot.window(range(1:10), range(1:10))
points(1:10)
box()

... does that do something like what you want?  (you have to do
something like par(pty="m") if you want to "remove" the par(pin)
setting)

yes.

The following seems a cautious solution:

t.ts <- function(x) {
    cl <- class(x)
    other <- !(cl %in% c("ts","mts"))
    class(x) <- if(any(other)) cl[other]
    attr(x, "tsp") <- NULL
    t(x)
}

It passes "make check" and I plan to commit as bug fix to  
R (beta) 1.6.0.

Subject: Documentation for passing character NAs to .C
Message-ID: <umgeoucmeciai57h9fb14p9sksaha3atrf@4ax.com>

I can't see any mention in the docs of what happens when a character
string NA is passed to an external function.  What appears to happen
is that it is converted to the two letter string 'NA'; I can't think
of anything better to do, but this should be mentioned somewhere (or
perhaps more prominently).  

The places I thought to look were the .C help file, and section 4.2 of
the Writing Extensions manual.

Message-ID: <200209172125.XAA01381@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Ron Wehrens
Version: 1.5.0

Submission from: (NULL) (128.95.17.61)


Consider these two functions:
switchme <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(type,
         E = max(...),
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}
switchme2 <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(type,
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}
The bottom one does what I expect. The top one only gives one answer,
independent 
of the second argument.
> switchme2("V", 1:4)
[1] 4
> switchme2("X", 1:4)
[1] -100
> switchme2("EII", 1:4)
[1] 10
> switchme("V", 1:4)
[1] 24
> switchme("X", 1:4)
[1] 24
> switchme("EII", 1:4)
[1] 24
 
Is there something special about "E"?

Jan,

Thanks for the update, and the additional info.

The test that fails is AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN, one of the standard Autoconf
tests, required in particular to determine the kind of Fortran name
mangling.  So yes, it is necessary.

The failure seems to come from the fact that when trying to determine
the dummy main to link with the Fortran 77 libraries, all efforts fail
along the lines of

configure:14562: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -I/sw/include -I/usr/local/include -L/sw
/lib -L/usr/local/lib conftest.c -lreadline -ldl -lncurses -lm   -lcrtbegin.o -L

> Is there something special about "E"?

Yes. It matches the EXPR arg to switch using partial matching, so the
case selector becomes max(1:4) == 4 and the fourth case is used to gie
prod(1:4) == 24. Not a bug, although perhaps a feature regretted by
the inventor...

The workaround (except for avoiding case labels E, EX, EXP) is 

switchme <- function(type, ...) {
  switch(EXPR=type,
         E = max(...),
         V = length(...),
         EII = sum(...),
         VII = prod(...),
         -100)
}

Subject: problem with make fullcheck on Sparc Solaris 8
Message-ID: <3D88A9CB.6080105@stat.ohio-state.edu>

I have been trying out R-1.6.0 tarballs (2002-9-10 and 2002-9-17) on:

arch     sparc
os       solaris2.8
system   sparc, solaris2.8
status   beta
major    1
minor    6.0
year     2002
month    09
day      17
language R

As you see form above, R-1.6.0 compiles fine and works.  However, when I 
  "make fullcheck" I get the following error:

running code in 'tools-Ex.R' ... OK
running code in 'ts-Ex.R' ... OK
running code in 'survival-Ex.R' ...bash: survival-Ex.R: No such file or 
directory
mv: cannot access survival-Ex.Rout
*** Error code 2

*** Error code 1

See the full output from "make fullcheck" at the end of this message.

It seams that the test examples for the recommended packages are never 
created.

I have both used GNU-tools (gmake version 3.79.1) and Solaris tools, but 
with the same results.


Any feedback would be great,
Gardar

I've just had the same problem (with 2002-9-12) on Solaris 2.8 using GNU

Thanks, but the problem was supposedly fixed by this change

Thu Sep 12 17:15:43 UTC 2002, hornik
  Need 'R_LIBS=' when calling R CMD INSTALL.
  R/src/library/Recommended Makefile.in,1.10

so a build of 2002-9-12 is not very informative.

Could you two please

a) Retry with a clean build (just in case)
b) Tell us whether you have R_LIBS set
c) Tell us whether you build in the source directory or separately
d) Show the output of ls `bin/R RHOME`/library

(should be like this

[pd@butterfly BUILD]$ ls `bin/R RHOME`/library
base     ctest    grid        MASS     mva   R.css    stepfun   ts
boot     e1071    KernSmooth  methods  nlme  rpart    survival
class    eda      lattice     mgcv     nls   spatial  tcltk
cluster  foreign  lqs         modreg   nnet  splines  tools

)

and also check whether survival has the R-ex subdirectory with the
relevant contents.

Though I asked for "sum" contrasts, the v1 coefficients came back
with "treatment" contrasts.  I don't see any technical reason why
"sum" contrasts can't be computed.  Is it a bug?

Also, why should the order of the variables be reversed (f1:v2 where
I would have expected v2:f1, etc.)?

By the way, S-plus refuses to fit this model at all ("Problem in

Dear R-Gang -
	Two questions for you:
	1)  I cannot figure out how to sort one column in an array, 
and drag the rest of the values that occupy the other columns along 
with the sorted values in the first column.  What I would like to end 
up with is an array that is the same size and dimensions as the first 
array.  When I try various configurations of sort, I keep getting 
vectors instead of the array I started with, and I have not found a 
way to make sort "bind" other values to the sorted values.
	2)  I used a PC version of R over the summer, and was able to 
use rowSum, colSum and similar functions.  These (and other things) 
do not seem to be enabled on the Mac OS9 version.  Are they enabled 
on the OS10 version?  If not, how can I enable them?  And how do I 
download the OS10 version?  My computer does not recognize the .gz 
files on the website http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/atlas/.
	Many thanks,
	Chris Wills

Do this:

	# example data matrix
	datamat <- matrix(rnorm(1000),ncol=20)

	ord <- order(x[,1])
	sortmat <- datamat[ord,]

Versions of R with the same version number generally doe the same
thing on all platforms, so you must have been using an older one.

I believe the one you want is this file

Subject: savehistory directories and quitting R (PR#2038)
Message-ID: <200209190454.GAA13201@pubhealth.ku.dk>

#

######################################################

Because I work in different directories, but always want to save my
.Rhistory in the same place, I have changed the system function savehistory
to this:

function (file = "D:/R50/.Rhistory") 
invisible(.Internal(savehistory(file)))

When I use q() to quit R, and it asks me whether I want to "save current
workspace", a response of YES means that the .Rhistory is saved in the
current working directory, rather than D:/R50/.Rhistory. I take this to mean
that the quit-on-prompt sequence makes a direct call to .Internal(
savehistory...) rather than going via the actual savehistory() function. It
would be nicer if prompt-on-quit would honour the user's definition of
savehistory.

(Responding NO to the "save current..." prompt means that .Rhistory isn't
saved at all, which is reasonable.)

I admit that this is a very minor bug, because I can set .Last to call
savehistory directly. But I just thought you should know...

cheers
Mark

What happens on shutdown is specific to the platform you're working
on, but in both Windows and Unix versions, the filename is taken from
the R_HISTFILE environment variable.  I don't know if this works on
the Mac.

This would be more obvious if the R savehistory() function were
changed to check the R_HISTFILE environment variable too.

The problem with using the user's savehistory() function is that this
violates the idea of namespaces that we're working towards:  users
should be able to create their own function named "savehistory"
without worrying about changing important internal behaviour.

No I don't think it does (and near as I can tell they are missing from
the tarball).

I will be building and distributing the final release.  Kevin Wang has
been building snapshots and posting them at

 <http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~kwan022/rinfo.php>

Since I'm going to be out of town from Sept 25 to Oct 1, and I'm busy
preparing for that trip, I haven't been posting snapshots.  If there's
a demand for them and Kevin has to stop, I could do so up to the 25th,
but not easily after that.

The final release will be posted in the usual place on CRAN.  It will
be called rw1060.exe rather than SetupR.exe, and the rw1060??.zip
files will no longer be posted.  The miniR files (which each fit on a
diskette) will be named as before, miniR.exe and miniR-1.bin up to
miniR-7.bin.

Hi,

Trying to install the binary distribution (zip file) for the "pixmap" package,
as downloaded today from CRAN, I get the following warning "error -1". The
package will not be installed. 
Installation of other packages (e.g. pinktoe, acepack) worked fine. The warning
or error seems to be thrown by .Internal(int.unzip).

I also tried with an external unzip programm, setting: options(unzip="pkunzip").
This eliminates the error message, and install.packages() terminates quietly
without warnings, however also without installing anything (for all of the above
packages).

So, possibly the package pixmap is corrupted in some strange way that only
int.unzip sees?

I can reproduce this (with a 1.5.0 prerelease, though). I can't get a
handle on what the reason might be, but it did seem to work simply to
unzip pixmap.zip into rw1050/library. The HTML help will not be quite
perfect, but hey, there are only two functions in the package...

pixmap.zip was built with 1.3.1, so maybe a repackaging would be in
order.

OK, I think I traced this to the fact that "test" on Solaris with the
Bourne shell will be the built-in one which doesn't understand the
-nt operator. Of course my own test builds used /bin/bash...

This is likely not a portable fix, but could you just for verification
try replacing test with /bin/test in the Makefile in tests/Examples?

I can keep doing this up until it is officially released.  But I will not
be doing this on a daily basis.  I'll post up snapshot every three or four
days.

Kevin

To all,

Recently I created a version of barplot() to include some new features 
as follows:

1. Plot confidence intervals for each bar: The user can pass lower 
(ci.l) and upper (ci.u) bounds in the same vector/matrix format as 
"height".  The CI boundary lines will vary in width per bar, if a 
varying "width" argument is specified. CI line width, type and color can 
be defined.  Defaults to 1, "solid" and black, respectively. Works with 
horizontal or vertical plot. Will work with beside = TRUE. Will not work 
if stacked bar plot results at this time. Argument plot.ci = c("TRUE", 
"FALSE") defines whether these are drawn.

2. Color plot region separately from the background area, if desired. 
Argument "prcol" defaults to NULL.

3. Draw "height" axis grid lines *behind* the bars.  Grid line width, 
type and color can be specified. Defaults to 1, "dotted" and black 
respectively. Argument plot.grid = c("TRUE", "FALSE") defines if the 
grid is plotted.

I have made these modifications with the intent to not "break" any 
existing code, so that identical calls to this version should work the 
same as the current implementation.

The current full function argument list is as follows:

barplot2 <- function(height, ...) UseMethod("barplot2")

barplot2.default <-
function(height, width = 1, space = NULL, names.arg = NULL,
      legend.text = NULL, beside = FALSE, horiz = FALSE,
      density = NULL, angle = 45,
      col = heat.colors(NR), prcol = NULL, border = par("fg"),
      main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
      xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, xpd = TRUE, log = "",
      axes = TRUE, axisnames = TRUE,
      cex.axis = par("cex.axis"), cex.names = par("cex.axis"),
      inside = TRUE, plot = TRUE,
      plot.ci = FALSE, ci.l = NULL, ci.u = NULL,
      ci.color = "black", ci.lty = "solid", ci.lwd = 1,
      plot.grid = FALSE, grid.inc = 5,
      grid.lty = "dotted", grid.lwd = 1, grid.col = "black",
      ...)


In late August, there was a post from Rengie Chan with a query on using 
log axis scaling with barplot(), which is presently precluded as coded 
as per my reply to his post.  I also noted that Paul Murrell has a note 
about this on his to-do page at: 
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/graphicstodos.html

I have spent some time over the past couple of weeks or so (thinking 
that this was going to be easier than it turned out to be) working on 
this as time has permitted.

I now have barplot2() working with both x and/or y axis log scaling, for 
single bars, multiple bars ("beside = TRUE") and for stacked bars.

Some of the key issues are of course preventing log(<=0) related errors 
in the axis scaling, which I have done and incorporating the other 
features that I have added above to be compatible with log scaling. 
These include adjusting the par("usr") values as well as the bar 
baseline values when stacked for log scaling and so forth. Also, the 
"hatch" type bar shading does not work with a log scale, so an error 
check is included to catch this. 

I have attached the R code for this version, called barplot2(), for the 
time being.  I make this code available to R-Core if so desired, and to 
the community at large.  If anyone finds any bugs, let me know.

The areas that I am still a bit unsure of (and open to criticism on) are 
as follows:

1. When using log scaling, I have arbitrarily set the lower limit of the 
"height" related axis to 0.9 * min(height), to enable some of the 
smallest bar to actually be plotted. This figure is adjusted to include 
0.9 * min(ci.l) when plotting CI's.  This can be over-ridden by setting 
either ylim or xlim explicitly of course.  If anyone feels that this 
should be different, let me know.

2. When plotting grid lines, I have resorted to using pretty() to define 
the axis tick marks, labels and grid lines by default.  This took some 
time, after I noted posts to R-Help on the issues with par("xaxp") and 
par("yaxp") when log scaling is used. I also noted Ross Ihaka's 
sci.axis() function. I wrestled with trying to be consistent in the 
behavior of the grid lines for both linear and log scaling and differing 
approaches.

However, given that both barplot() and more significantly the axis() C 
code in plot.c forces "lty = 0" as presently coded, I wanted to give the 
user the ability to visually "de-emphasize" the gridlines with 
alternative line types, widths and colors. Thus I am using abline() with 
intervals set by pretty(), with the user able to specify how many 
intervals using "grid.inc", with a default of 5 as in pretty(). If 
anyone has any better thoughts on how to approach this, I am open.

I was trying to figure out a way to call the C code in plot.c that 
generates the default axis intervals (CreateAtVector), but would get 
errors indicating that the function is not in the load table.  This 
would seem to be a cleaner approach at first glance, since it would 
result in consistent default axis interval behavior when not plotting 
grid lines.  I am open to pointers or other thoughts on this.

Finally, there are two .NotYetUsed arguments in barplot().

First is "border", which defaults to par("fg").  I presume that this is 
simply meant to be the "border" argument to rect()?  If so, I can make 
that change easily.

Second is the "inside" argument.  If I read the help file correctly, 
this will draw a line between adjacent bars.  However, I am unsure if 
this is intended to be a "grouping" line that runs the full height or 
width of the plotting region such that it divides a group of bars (ie. 
beside = TRUE) or if it is simply a heavier line between each bar.  If 
someone can clarify this, I can work on this as well.

I appreciate any feedback from the group and hope that this work is of 
value to users of barplot().

Best regards,

Marc Schwartz

The internal variable that holds the value is set at startup.  I don't
think this is a bug, because I don't know of any documentation that
suggests it would do anything else, but it probably would make sense
to read the environment at the time the save is requested, rather than
at startup.

I'm no expert on namespaces, but I think you can, similar to the way
that you now save things into specific environments rather than the
global one.

Well, 2 help pages doesn't mean only 2 functions ... unless you count
all methods for a generic only as one function.

There will be a new release of pixmap next week which contains a
complete rewrite of the code using the methods package, hence it
might not be worth the effort.

Argh.  Not listed under portable shell programming in the Autoconf
manual ...

Otoh, my SysV 7th ed man pages from 79 do not list '-nt' etc, so maybe
we should not use it.  Peter, can you perhaps try rewriting the simple

        if test $(top_builddir)/library/$${pkg} -nt "$@" ; then \

in tests/Examples/Makefile.in using find -newer (which is already in the
7th edition)?

That is, the recommened packages are not installed.

I traced this down to the solaris version of make (gmake works fine).

I think the solaris version has problem with the "_tgz" suffixes!

Subject: Install with 64-bit GCC 3.2 (PR#2048)
Message-ID: <200209201634.SAA01188@pubhealth.ku.dk>


Hi,

been trying to build R-1.5.1 for som eof our users here.

No probs with gcc-3.2 32-bit installtion, but thought we'd try it with
the 64-bit just for the crack.

Configuring thus

CC=gcc3 CFLAGS="-m64" CXX=g++3 CXXFLAGS="-m64" F77=g773 FFLAGS="-m64"
LDFLAGS="-m64 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9" ./configure
--prefix=/usr/local/packages/R-1.5.1-64bit

runs OK, however one of the tests (I assume it is a test anyway) fails thus

gcc3 -G  -o ctest.so ansari.o chisqsim.o d2x2xk.o fexact.o kendall.o ks.o  prho.o swilk.o init.o  -L/usr/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2 -L/usr/ccs/bin/sparcv9 -L/usr/ccs/bin -L/usr/ccs/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/ccs/lib -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/../../../sparcv9 -L/usr/local/packages/gcc-3.2/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/3.2/../../.. -L/lib/sparcv9 -ldl -ltermcap -lfrtbegin -lg2c -lm -lgcc_s_sparcv9   
ld: fatal: file ansari.o: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to ctest.so
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `ctest.so'
Current working directory /usr/local/packages/src/R-1.5.1/src/library/ctest/src


It appears the make process is not passing the "-m64" flag down from
the LDFLAGS variable as set when running configure.

I have tried a compilation by hand adding this flag to the link stage
and the above compilation goes completes.


Hoping this of use,

I was able to get it all to compile by altering the
src_dir/etc/Makeconf file so that the shared lib LD flags
variables contain -m64

SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS = -G -m64

SHLIB_LDFLAGS = -G -m64

these only had "-G" by default.

Dunno why they dont pick them up as part of the standard configure
though - one for you I guess !

but not on Debian. On Solaris, I get FALSE with both 1.5.1 and 1.6.0beta.

I built it myself. I checked with my Debian system at home, and,
interestingly, there 'dtrmm_' is loaded. Then I reinstalled R-1.5.1, and
'dtrmm_' is still missing! So I get different results on different
_machines_, not different versions of R. I have different setups of atlas
on the two machines. Can that be the cause? Note that not all BLAS
routines are missing, only a selected few. I configure with

./configure --with-gnome --enable-R-shlib

Hmm. On Franz (alias cvs.r-project.org) I seem to be linking against
this guy

[pd@franz pd]$ file /usr/lib/3dnow/atlas/libblas.so.2.3

Could that have something to do with it? The corresponding .a file
does have various incarnations of dtrmm inside.

I'd think so.

I also use --with-blas=blas, but that has in part to do with the magic of
giving you Atlas when you have it installed, and blas if you don't. In other
word the Debian packages depends on a subset (default Blas) which can be
enhanced by installing either the default non-cpu-optimised atlas2-base, or
by installing a cpu-optimised atlas package like atlas2-3dnow for Athlons.
It is a fairly flexible scheme, which out Atlas maintainer developed.

But in short, yes, your Atlas setup on your machine will most likely govern
all of that. If you want a particular feature, I suspect it would help to be
explicit with configure.

I tried that, without success. In fact, no blas library is found, acording
to 'ldd R.bin'. I have

/usr/lib/sse/atlas
/usr/lib/sse

in ld.so.conf and I have run 'ldconfig'. I don't understand why atlas
isn't picked up.

One way for you to make your life easier would be to 

  a) simply install the existing 1.6.0.beta package(s), or 

  b) rebuild it locally as its Build-Depends ought to imply the same
     structure that works for me as well as for eleven build daemons on
     other architectures. 

I suggest we continue this in private mail. Let me know how I can help.

Dirk

Message-ID: <200209210515.g8L5F5C31655@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Actually, I think the problem is already fixed for 1.6.0.  Can you pls
try a current R 1.6.0 beta snapshot?

Subject: socket bug ??? (PR#2056)
Message-ID: <200209231430.QAA16928@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Please help me,

I use R-1.4.1 and everything works fine. But with R-1.5.1 ist does'nt work:

I have this put into a file called "socket.R"

while(TRUE){
con1 <- socketConnection(host="localhost",port=6021,server=TRUE);
source(con1);
close(con1);
}


So I can use R with:

source("socket.R")

and R answers me when I send a command to it via socket 6021. But in version 
1.5.1 it does'nt work. Have you any idea?

Many thanks

I have installed R-1.5.1 using SetupR.exe on both my home laptop (Sony Vaio

they shared the same problem. Both worked for a while, but then Rgui.exe crashed
on the startup, complains:

The exception Floating-point invalid operation.
(0xc0000090) occurred in the application at location 0x00435c10.

Despite repeated uninstalled-reboot-install, the crash still persists? Somehow R
remembers it was installed on the machine before, since I can find a new machine
and it will installed and work, but after a while (usually a reboot) it crashes
on startup...

You may need to add blocking=TRUE to the call.  When I do that I can
connect by telnet and send commands (although they aren't run until I
close the connection.)

If you start it with the command line option "--vanilla", it will skip
a lot of automatically executed code at the beginning.  Could you try
that and see if it fixes the problem?

If so, then it might be worth narrowing down which part is
responsible, by adding the individual options one at a time:
--no-save, --no-restore, --no-site-file, --no-init-file
and --no-environ.

If --vanilla has no effect, then it might just be a coincidence that
it works at first.  The usual culprit for spurious floating point
exceptions is code that plays around with the floating point control
word, and doesn't restore it properly.  Many buggy video drivers do
this, for instance.  I could send you some code that detects this bug,
but it's hard to determine what software caused it.

Thanks, Duncan, for your help. I have tried each of the suggestions:

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --vanilla

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-save

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-restore

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-site-file

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-init-file

C:\Program Files\R\rw1051\bin>Rgui.exe --no-environ

Each case results in the same crash. By the way, how do I restore the
"floating point control word" ? I don't intentionally run video on my
desktop, but maybe something like in real player/ms media player...

Thanks again

Zhen

After starting R, when I give a graphic command (e.g. barplot, plot, etc.) R
crashes with the comment from Windows "Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be
closed by Windows. . . . "  I have tried reinstalling msvcrt.dll in the \bin

By the way, I have found the offending application: it is a virtual screen
manager called JSP2. As soon as deinstalled it, R works just fine.

Hopefully this will help other people may have similar problems.

Thanks again for your help,

Strange. Try to start R with --vanilla. Does the error persist?

Two bugs here, one trivial: The error message should say B, not A. The
(slightly) less trivial one is that b needs conversion to matrix for
the underlying Lapack routine to work:

Confirmed. The Problem is the wrong error message in the underlying C
code, file .../src/modules/lapack/Lapack.c, line 303:
    error("A must be a complex matrix");
must be changed to
    error("B must be a complex matrix");

Thanks, I can live with that, but for conformance with the man page and
with splus (3.4) it would be nice if B could be a (complex) vector.

Subject: split.screen problem (PR#2069)
Message-ID: <200209261737.TAA21302@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Chris Bodily
Version: 1.5.1
OS: W2K
Submission from: (NULL) (63.106.106.2)


I took the following code directly from the 'split.screen' help page in R and
modified one line to highlight the problem I encountered.  Basically, it appears
that when plotting in split screens and attempting to return to a particular
screen to add or update points, the axes from the original plot are not
remembered, causing the new points to plot incorrectly.
 
A workaround seem to be storing the original plot range and issuing
'plot(x,y,type="n")' where x and y are data vectors with ranges that match the
original plot in the screen of interest.  Then a 'points' command draws in the
correct locations.
 
I found this by moving working code from S-Plus 2000 into R v1.5.1 and noticed
that a particular interactive plot I use began drawing incorrectly.
 
Thanks,
 
Chris Bodily

Subject: rsync.r-project.org and cran.us.r-project.org
Message-ID: <6radm48jb1.fsf@bates3.stat.wisc.edu>

Around noon Wednesday, Sept 25, the machine that serves as
rsync.r-project.org and cran.us.r-project.org had a catastrophic disk
failure.  I came back to my office after a lecture and immediately
thought "I don't think disk drives are supposed to make grinding
noises".  :-)

It was the drive with the system files that failed.  Most user files
and the CRAN archive (not to mention the CVS archive) are on another
drive that is running fine.  However, we did have to build and install
the operating system from scratch then reinstall the files from the
backups.

Many people provided a great deal of help and we now have that
computer running.  I believe that rsync services and the CRAN mirror
are running as expected.  Be aware that they have not been updated
since early Wednesday morning (U.S. Central Time).
