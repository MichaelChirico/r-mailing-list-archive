Subject: odd result of length() with factor arguments with NA (PR#354)
Message-ID: <199912010217.DAA03249@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following looks odd to me, but it may well be that I'm doing
something I shouldn't:

x <- c(rep("a",5),NA,rep("b",7))
X <- as.factor(x)
length(X)
# [1] 13
length(X[X=="a"])  
# [1] 6              I expected 5
length(X[X=="b"])
# [1] 8              I expected 7 
length(X[is.na(X)])
# [1] 1              yes
length(X[X=="d"])  
# [1] 1              but there is no "d"

Thank you.

This is correct: it is your expectations that are wrong. It helps to
look at the result.

> X=="a"
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
FALSE
[13] FALSE
> X=="d"
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
FALSE
[13] FALSE
> X[X=="a"]
[1] a  a  a  a  a  NA
Levels:  a b


What is going on is that the NA results are regarded as genuinely unknown.
So the sixth entry may or may not be "a": we just don't know. So the
only thing we can do is to record NA.  And that applies when we subset too.
It might also be "d".

Now if you may meant NA to be a _level_ of the factor, use

> X <- factor(x, exclude="")
> X[X=="a"]
[1] a a a a a
Levels:  a b NA 

which might be what you expected. That treats NA as missing and known not
to be "a" nor "b".

Subject: density(kernel = "cosine") .. the `wrong cosine' ..
Message-ID: <14404.61675.357953.94472@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

I'm in teaching mode,  kernel densities.

{History:  density() was newly introduced in version 0.15,  19 Dec 1996;
	   most probably by Ross or Robert
}

When I was telling the students about different kernels (and why their
choice is not so important, and "equivalent bandwidths" etc,etc)
I wondered about the "Cosine" in my teaching notes which 
is defined there as

   k(x) = pi/4 * cos(pi/2 * x) *  I{ |x| <= 1 }
i.e. in R
  Kcos <- function(x) ifelse(abs(x) <= 1, pi/4 * cos(pi/2 * x), 0)

Now, R has instead (for bandwidth  h <- bw/1.135724  which makes the bandwidth
		    Gaussian equivalent;	     
		    here just h == 1/pi to be similar to above)
  
  Kcosine <- function(x) ifelse(abs(x) < 1, (1+cos(x*pi))/2 , 0)

I've looked in Dave Scott's (and Haerdle's "Smoothing... in S") book,
(Silverman doesn't mention any cosine kernel)
and both define the cosine kernel as I have it in my notes.

With above R code, look at

   x <- seq(-1.2,1.2,len=501)
   matplot(x, cbind(Kcos(x),Kcosine(x)), type='l', lty=1)

The big difference :

  - R's version is smooth (differentiable at the border of support)
  - Scott's (not really "his", of course!) version is not differentiable
    but looks much closer to the Epanechnikov kernel and is hence almost
    as `good' (less than half a percent of MSE loss w.r.t Epanechnikov).


Problem:

 - An average user knowing some statistics literature will most probably
   assume that a "cosine" kernel means the one in the literature, 
   *NOT* the one we have in R now.

Proposition / Possibilities / RFC [= Request For Comments] :

 - We CHANGE the behavior of  density(* , kernel="cosine")
   to use the cosine from the litterature.

 - provide the current "cosine" as  kernel = "smoothcosine"
   {I'd like to keep the possibility of 1-initial-letter abbreviation}


Enhancement (easy, I'll do that):

  - We further provide both
    Epanechnikov and "quartic" aka "biweight" additionally
    in any case.

Or they have know what is in S (or what V&R say it is). (Yes, we knew of
the discrepancy, so defined it.)

I am against that. S compatibility and all that.

OK, or

3) As it is confusing and never used(?), drop it altogether.

You may find it hard to get agreement on what those are (the problem
being the scale factors).

After peeking at Octave, I think I'd prefer reverting to something close
to the orginal suggestion.  Would

#ifdef const
# define yyconst const
#else
# define yyconst
#endif

SEXP            mkString(yyconst char *);

...

work?

-k

(The #ifdef part would go in after the #include statements in gram.y.)

I've looked in MASS 3rd ed., before my post; but didn't find that remark...
(now I did : middle of p.134).

But then, our density() is not S compatible 
(and the help page has always said so) anyway,
and doesn't want to copy
some of that sillynesses (default bandwidth; gaussian factor of 2 [or 4?]),..

that's against S compatibility as well.
*AND* we make it `impossible' to do what was possible earlier.

That shouldn't matter as long as I provide an `equivalent bandwidth'
factor, should it?
I think nobody can assume that something like
   ``density with Epanechnikov kernel & bandwidth 2'' is universally well
defined.  But one should be able to easily compute an Epanechnikov kernel
estimate -- automatically using "equivalent bandwidths".

I'll change that.

BTW, there are good reasons for them to be "messed up" in the master
CVS archive.  What I will do is modify the script that updates the
copies of the archive that are visible through rsync.

Not cleaned up from last time, rather. It seems to affect files
modified between Nov 9 and 22. Files are owned by bates, group bates,
so we have to wait for Doug to fix this. The R-0.90-PATCHES directory
is also affected, BTW.

Interesting. There is no plot.aov on my system: this is using plot.lm.  
And I get no error.  It could be random, except this has nothing to do with
the data, only the labelling.

The error message means that ylab23 in NULL. I don't see how that can
happen with the system version of plot.lm.

My guess is masking. Do you have a local plot.lm?  Does this happen if
you start R with --vanilla?

I don't see it either. Is this completely reproducible? What is even
more confusing is that ylab23 was used to label the preceding plot,
just ca. 15 lines before. Did that give a normal y label?

>3a) 3b) 4) ... S compatibility

Well, since I'm often the one asking for S compatibility, I thought I should say
that, over the years, I have had so much trouble with S plotting that I am sure
there is a better way. My graphs are not very demanding and have always worked
fairly well in R. I'll wait on the new changes before I do any fine tuning.

One thing I would like to see is a clear separation between the parameters one
should use in programs and the ones that should be tweaked to get things right
on a particular platform/monitor/graphics card.  I think this is mostly done
already and perhaps I just need to find the documentation, but it is not clear
to me which catagory pointsize fits into.

You are quite right.  I had an experimental version of plot.lm()
lying around.  I should have thought of that.

0.99.0 *unreleased* you mean (snapshot). Actually this lags 0.90.0
Patched (the release branch snapshot) at the moment, since the
bugfixes have not been merged into the development version. 

Your problem is due to this line in the filled.contour function

layout(matrix(c(2, 1), nc = 2), widths = c(1, lcm(3)))

Works better if you set it to lcm(4). We'll be changing the default
font sizes in the next patch release due to common demand, so this may
go away all by itself, but it is a bit nasty to have a fixed width
in there.

In S 3 or 4 this works because functions are lists, in R they are not
lists. 

More worrying is 

	a<-list(one=sin,two=lm)
	a[[2]]<-sort  #fails
	a$two<-sort     #succeeds

Nope. Didn't know about that one. Works in S3 as well (and should
work in R, obviously). Thanks for pointing it out.

Subject: Inconsistent messages with [[ list indexing (PR#359)
Message-ID: <199912041416.PAA12018@pubhealth.ku.dk>

R 0.90.0:

> Empl <- list(aa=1, b=2, c=3)
> Empl[[as.numeric(NA)]]
Error in Empl[[as.numeric(NA)]] : subscript out of bounds
> Empl[[as.integer(NA)]]
Error: attempt to select more than one element
> Empl[[as.logical(NA)]]
Error: attempt to select more than one element

Now,

(a) None of those messages is appropriate.

(b) At least the first two should be the same.

(c) S gives NULL in each case.

Is there any reason not to follow S here?  If so, I would prefer a
specific error message (`NA cannot be used to select a list element').

The usage

Empl[[ match("a", names(Empl)) ]]

is a very convenient one to defeat partial matching, but the current
behaviour of R defeats it. OK,

Empl[ match("a", names(Empl)) ] [[1]]

works, but this is an ugly hack (and the answer should I believe be the
same as [[ ]]).

I keep getting the message that they are too big.  Is there some

gunzip followed by bzip2, I think. (Checks: 1241Kb) Do you actually mean an
MS-DOS floppy? Most people use VFAT file systems on floppies these days,
including Windows. You can't write those file names to an MS-DOS floppy.
(Our computing officer did manage to set up RH6 Linux to use msdos,
though.)

I assume that the script used needs adjusting.  I have never bothered with
this: I just split a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) into 1400Kb chunks and
concatenate on the target machine.

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

A 'bt' command to make gdb show where *in R* you get into that kind of
trouble... iofflush.c is probably inside glibc somewhere and you don't
have the source. Looks like a configuration/build/install kind of
error, so what did you do to deserve the above?

Original:

    ok <- grep("^[ \t]+$", text)
    if (length(ok) > 0) {
        text <- text[!ok]
    }

Fixed:

    notok <- grep("^[ \t]+", text)

        text <- text[-notok]
    }

 Subject: plot math - segfault and "frac", "^" bug(s)..

This is in R versions 0.65, 0.90.0, and the current "pre-release",
both on Linux and Solaris
[with x11() , but most probably not device dependent].

The following shows it all :

    plot(1,type='n')

    ## Frac doesn't shrink properly...
    text(.7,1.3,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=1)
    text(.7,1.2,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=3)

    ## Bug in precedency rule of  "^" :
    text(.7, 1,   expression( Phi^{-1}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)
    text(1.1,1,   expression( {Phi^{-1}}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)

    ## This segfaults :
    text(.9, 1,   expression( Phi^ -1 (frac(3,4))),cex=3)

Message-ID: <199912081733.SAA22746@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Try this:

plot(1:3,pch=c(1,2,NA))

The 3rd point is plotted as if pch were 1. This seems completely wrong
to me. Similar issue with cex= (you get the minimum size plotting dot
for the NA case there). With col= the point disappears, as I tend it
should in the other cases as well.

 Dear R-developers,

 recently I sent a bug report about plot(aov()) crashing R (resp. the
 X Windows part of R) without reporting the data I used.

 In the meantime, I discovered, that the problem is due to a .RData
 file -- without it, there is no crash, with that .RData loaded, the
 following small sequence of commands crashes R 0.90, too, on my
 machine. R had been started with "--vsize 16M --nsize 4000k":

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prof. Ripley suggested that it might be a XFree86 error, so I'll give
 you my X version, too (from X -showconfig):
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System
 (protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6300)
 Release Date: January 4 1999
         If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is newer
	         than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting
		         problems.  (see http://www.XFree86.Org/FAQ)
			 Operating System: Linux 2.0.36 i686 [ELF]
			 Configured drivers:
			   Mach64: accelerated server for ATI Mach64 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ... maybe I should upgrade my X windows system :-|

 I'll include the base64-encoded .RData file in gzipped form below. For
 me, the "problem" is solved, but maybe there is somebody in the
 development team who is interested in more details ...

Reproduce without the .RData file with

 X11(point=16,h=5,w=5)
 x <- data.frame(id=rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 100), val=rnorm(1:300))
 plot(aov(val ~ id, data=x))

(The X11 thing was in .First)

Message-ID: <384F73D5.6AB242FD@wu-wien.ac.at>

Fritz,

I have slightly adapted (didn't work before) "tsboot" from the "boot"
library to the current time series conventions of R. The following patch
will do that. I suggest to apply this patch to the file
"boot/R/bootfuns.q" of the "boot" library at CRAN.

Adrian

Adrian,

Thank you for the patches.

You need to send such things to the package maintainer, as mentioned in the
DESCRIPTION, in this case me. I knew tsboot would not work: it is by no
means the only thing in boot that does not work (yet): see PORTING.
I have delayed a serious attempt on those until the optimizer problems
are sorted out.

Most examples with \testonly in are partially or completely repeated:

?cat

<...>

Examples:

     ## print an informative message
     cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

     ## print an informative message
     cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

The drop_full_command processing in Rdconvlib.pl seems flawed.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.9912090944170.646-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  Can we add a note to the documentation that setting par(fig) resets
par(mfrow) and par(mfcol) to c(1,1)?
  Or are mfrow and mfcol now deprecated in favor of all the split screen
stuff?  (I was spending the morning trying to write some code that plotted
multiple subplots within whatever plot region was active at the moment; I
was able to set and reset fig successfully, but got very confused as to
why par(mfg) was no longer advancing ...  I know that in principle
 
  opar <- par(no.readonly=TRUE)
   ...
  par(opar)

should have reset everything, but [for reasons I'm too lazy to analyze] it
didn't seem to be working.)

The documentation does not *promise* that names will survive, but in
Splus3.4, they do. This broke a function that worked under S+ that used
the names attribute of elements in the components returned by split.

I don't think that names in x should be preserved here.  The names of
the returned list are obtained from the levels of the split factor f
(which, in your case, are "1" and "2").

Paul:

This simply is not supported.  Look at parse.format() in the chron pkg.
What it does is

* if format has 5 chars, parse as "a/b/c"

* if format has 3 chars, parse as "abc"

* else parse as "a b c" (and do not abbreviate month names if "month" is
given.

In you example, we get

R> unlist(parse.format("yy/m/d"))
    abb     sep periods mon.abb 
"FALSE"     " "     "y"  "TRUE" 

and hence we only get the years.

Hope this helps.

Subject: SAS XPORT Transport Format
Message-ID: <m11woG0-000ZSxC@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

A colleague pointed out that the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has adopted a transport format defined by SAS
Institute as a standard for electronic submissions of data.  As a
result, this format has been openly documented.

The URL for the documentation on the format is
       http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/technote/ts140.html

Information on the FDA standards for Electronic submissions is given at
       http://www.sas.com/software/industry/pht/fda/index.html

Has anyone written code to import data stored in this format into R?

Saikat DebRoy and I started reverse-engineering the format before our
colleague pointed out that it was openly documented.  It was a rather
interesting exercise because floating point format is _not_ an IEEE
format, it is an old format with a base 16 exponent, no hidden bit,
etc.  It takes me back to the days of punched cards, IBM mainframes,
JCL, ...

Well I've *thought* about doing it... And the SPSS format as well. And
DB3. And...

http://www.wotsit.org has tons of information on this sort of stuff.
(Although on SAS, it's just the TS140 again.) It's mentioned on the
Ideas list at developer.r-project.org (on a machine near you...), but
perhaps some elaboration would be in order there.

If you use the horiz= option with hist() you get the message:

Warning:
parameter "horiz" couldn't be set in high-level plot() function.

and the plot comes out vertical.  The documentation says this option comes from

barplot() and it does work correctly in barplot().

This message comes whether horiz= is set to FALSE or TRUE.

I have started a read.dbf routine, as part of the map manipulation

have C code to manipulate dbf, just need to adapt it for R

The warning message you are getting is just telling you that "horiz" is not
a valid argument to hist() (and that it is not a valid par() either).
"horiz" is quite specific to barplot().

what was the documentation that lead you to try "horiz" with hist() ?

paul

p.s.  you can "fake" a horizontal histogram using barplot.  for example, try
...

x<-rnorm(20)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), pty="s")
hist.info <- hist(x, breaks=-3:3)
barplot(hist.info$counts, space=0, horiz=T)
axis(2, labels=-3:3)

... but perhaps you would prefer it if we made it so that you could use
"horiz" with hist() ?

Subject: t.test inside function (PR#373)
Message-ID: <199912130906.KAA02783@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Try this code as separate lines entered interactively, then try doit()

doit<-function()
{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE)
t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE)
}

doit() apparently executes only the last of a series of t.test()s.

Maybe this is no bug, but I can't see why this behaviour is shown.

You need to print the answer: the last is printed by auto-printing.
More generally, if you want something printed in a function, you
need to print it explicitly. This applies to braced expressions too,
so

{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE)
t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE)
}

shows the effect.

What happens inside a function is not printed unless you ask for it.
You probably want something like

doit<-function()
{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
print(t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE))
print(t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE))
}

instead.

Message-ID: <199912131833.KAA12807@dvorak.Berkeley.EDU>

Paul,

Thank you for your quick reply.  The reason I thought horiz= would work with
hist() is that it does in Splus.  (I was converting an S script to R.)  In
Splus, help(hist) syntax denotes by ... "additional arguments to barplot".
However, I just noticed that in R, help(hist) denotes by ...  "further
graphical parameters to 'title' and 'axis'".

Please consider adding this functionality to hist().  In the mean time, I'll
try out your barplot() example as a possible replacement for my hist() command.
Thank you for providing it.

Fran Rizzardi

P.S. Please say hello to Ross for me if you see him.  He was a housemate of
mine in graduate school.

I think it quite likely that we could do pick up that code for use by
the R project.  Ben, could you point us to the part of PSPP where you
parse the SPSS .sav format (or whatever they call it)?

Saikat DebRoy and I are currently working on code to parse the SAS
XPORT data format and incorportate those files into R.  We can
certainly share that with you when it is complete.

You have a few choices here:

	1. Grab sfm-read.c, sfm-write.c, sfm.h, and sfmP.h in
           src/ in the PSPP distribution.

	2. Read through the comprehensive documentation on the
           format, also in the PSPP distribution.  See pspp.info
           or pspp.texi in doc/.

	3. I originally found the information on the format
           somewhere on spss.com.  You could probably find it
           there too.

PSPP also reads and write SPSS portable files.  You have the same
three choices here.

Dear Sirs,

Try the following simple r-program

a<-data.frame(1:10)
b<-matrix(NA,3,1)
z<-rbind(b,as.matrix(a))

While it works well i R0.64.1, it appears to be deleterious for R0.90.0.
When I run it, R crashes. I'm using Windows NT on a Pentium II system.

Please let me know if you need some other details.

    o   `Rcomplex' is preferred to `complex' (a future reserved word
        in C) for R complex objects passed to C.

I'm a bit confused here. Is "complex" or "Rcomplex" the future reserved
word in C (I thought "complex" already was, but I'm not a C programmer)
and is this because R storage modes should or should not have names
corresponding to C reserved words?  I presume this means I should use
something like

storage.mode(z) <- if (is.R()) "Rcomplex" else "complex"

Is that right?

yes.  As a matter of fact, I think  machine() should become deprecated...

complex is not currently reserved, but it is in the draft stanadrd
revision.  (I might see the confusion. It does not say `to be passed to C',
and it means after passing to C.)

No! Use complex in interpreted R code and Rcomplex in C.

We will shortly have compatibility headers for the C code that covers this.

Foreign.Rd has not yet been updated to reflect this change, but
the Writing R Extensions manual has.

Saikat DebRoy and I have created a "foreign" package to read data in
formats stored by various well-known statistical packages.  The
read.stata function is already available in another package.
Saikat is currently working on a function to read SAS XPORT format.
I have created a read.mtp function for Minitab Portable Worksheet
format.  We will upload this package to CRAN by next week.

I think we will change all of these to read.foreign before uploading
and make it so the file name extension indicates the type of file.

I recently took "." off my PATH for security reasons and now find
that R does not work in my home directory where the .Renviron
file resides.

The fix is simple.  In the R shell startup section replace
". .Renviron" by ". ./.Renviron".  The relevant section is:

# Startup
if ${USE_R_ENVIRON}; then # use the one in current dir, or default
  if [ -r .Renviron ]
  then . ./.Renviron      # <<-- change
  else [ -r ${R_ENVIRON} ] && . ${R_ENVIRON}

Subject: aggregate.ts (PR#376)
Message-ID: <199912161315.OAA18954@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I'm having some problems with aggregate.ts, e.g.

R> x <- ts(1:20)
R> frequency(x)
[1] 1

R> aggregate(x, nfreq=1/3)
Error in aggregate.ts(x, nfreq = 1/3) : cannot change frequency from 1 to
0.333333333333333

In fact aggregate.ts only accepts a new frequency that is a negative
power of two in this example. 

The problem with the current test for compatible frequencies

    if ((ofrequency%%nfrequency) != 0)
        stop(paste("cannot change frequency from", ofrequency,
            "to", nfrequency))

is that numerical errors may cause it to fail.  I suggest

     if (abs(ofrequency%%nfrequency) < ts.eps)

instead.

It's been like that since January, and is OK on my machine. This is yet
another example in which the Linux run-time libraries are not
taking account that extended precision calculations are probably
inappropriate:
Browse[1]> ofrequency%%nfrequency
[1] 5.551115e-17
is half or one quarter the machine precision (depending on how you define it).
(We fixed 10 or so such examples a few releases ago where Linux was
differing from Solaris and also from Windows.)

I'll put in the test you suggest (with > not < !)  Should we be fixing
%%, that is if  y%%x is less than 5*machine precision times abs(x),
returning zero?  (I see S-PLUS does not.)

Could easily be changed, but I'd like to understand it first.  I cannot
reproduce the problem.  I never have `.' in my PATH and when I do

	cat > foo
	echo I am here
	CTRL-D
	. foo

I get "I am here".

Of course, this happens on Debian GNU/Linux.  Is this a system-specific
problem or feature?

Same as Clive Loaders #358 (Darn! I think we almost had a fix for that
one, but forgot to apply it. Thomas?)

This example from the INSTALL help seems to be broken in R 0.90.1 (on Solaris):

gilp/dse : R CMD check --help
Usage: R CMD check [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n


I'm trying to figure out how to request more nsize and vsize when using R CMD
check.

In a Bourne shell or derivative thereof use a sequence like

R_VSIZE=10M
R_NSIZE=800K
export R_NSIZE R_VSIZE
R CMD check ...

In csh or tcsh use setenv instead.

Subject: plot()  after split.screen() on postscript() Device produces inconsistent PostScript file (PR#378)
Message-ID: <199912172032.VAA05044@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Boris Leykekhman
Version: 0.90.0
OS: Red Hat Linux 6.1
Submission from: (NULL) (131.136.242.1)


Problem:
Plot()  after split.screen() on postscript() Device produces PostScript file,
which crashes PS interpretter with error message: 
Error: /undefined in fg
To reproduce:
#----- Start R code
postscript("test.ps")
split.screen(c(2,2))
screen(1)
plot(c(1,2,3,4))
dev.off()
#----- End R code
Workaround:
Inserting the line with definition of  fg, taken from the correct PS file,
solved my problem.
The line is: 
/fg {0.0000 0.0000 0.0000} def fg rgb
It was inserted after:
%%EndProlog2

Description:

Apparently, it will 

Split the Strings in `x' into substrings according to the presence of
ANY CHARACTER FOUND IN substring `split'.

-------------------

Was this intended? I expected, as the documentation implies that the
result from above would be:

"acbdefg"   "higkilmnSpPqrst"

Yes it was intended. Strsplit interfaces to the strtok() C routine,

       char *strtok(char *s, const char *delim);

DESCRIPTION
       A `token' is a nonempty string of characters not occurring
       in the string delim, followed by  \0  or  by  a  character
       occurring in delim.

and `split' gets passed as `delim'. The documentation is bad, though.

Or put this in your ~/.Renviron file.  (You still need the export,
although this should be eliminated before 1.0.)

check runs R --vanilla, and that skips .Renviron and ~/.Renviron, so that
idea does not work (at least for me on 0.90.1).

The two tcl things by Guido are actually quite nice, at least as
proofs of concepts. With the right intro text, I'd say that they could
move to contrib.

I'd expect the ts things to be superseded by later events. Brian?

What a surprise! I had no idea anyone was interested in this stuff or had bothered even to put it forward...

This was originally my S-PLUS front end to some work of Miller & Nguyen on finding D-optimal designs with blocking.  Had I known someone was interested in porting it to R I may have found some time to work on it.  As it is I will not.  If the contributor (Halvorsen) does nothing more with it I think it should be just dropped.  There are problems with the Fortran and it would take some work to get it going.  The S code is unnecessarily complicated as well.  (I did it some time ago when I was younger and more ambitious...)

That's for their authors to say. I would regard bats as superseded by ts.
timeslab is a port to R of a port to S of some routines in a DOS package
accompanying a book by Newton, and so might be useful for users of that
book. My understanding is that the copyright had not been resolved: the
porter had not sought the author's permission. If there has been no
progress within a year I suggest we drop this.

I see ratetables is in Devel. This is part of survival4, separated
out to save space, so I think it should really be in Old.

The "bats" library is obsoleted by ts. I'm not doing any further

You are right.  Should we change that?  (The reason we have --vanilla is
because the R distribution uses the same, but this is probably a bad
idea for add-ons which may be KNOWN to need more memory.)

And, tcltk should take advantage of the configure/cleanup mechanism to

Subject: concatenating dataframes (PR#381)
Message-ID: <199912202244.XAA25245@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following work if y is an ordinary matrix but not a dataframe:

tt <- NULL
y <- data.frame(1:20,1:20)
rbind(tt,y)

gives "incompatible types" error (if the dataframe contains only factor
variables, it gives warnings but works)

if I initialize instead with

tt <- list()

it gives a "missing value where logical needed" error.

Message-ID: <199912202243.XAA25231@pubhealth.ku.dk>



-- Happy holidays! --


Dear R Development Core Team,

I want to thank you *very much* for the new "Writing R Extensions" manual
published with RW0.901 and hope this is the right place to report some
possible typos.


page 17, example given in the middle of the page, I think it should read

REAL(version) = 3.0;
          ^^^^^^^


page 23, second example, I think the parameter definition should read

SEXP lapply2(SEXP list, SEXP fn, SEXP rho)
                                              ^^

and the last line of the function I guess should be

VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
                                  ^^^^^^^^

If my understanding is wrong or you discover another typo in the lapply2
example, please give me a short note.

Regards

Message-ID: <199912210615.HAA05627@biostat.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

It's not really new: it is a merge of the old Manual.tex and
R-external.texi that was distributed with 0.90.0. As 1.0 approaches we
are beginning to work hard on documentation.

The intention here was that the parameter be`expr' (it is an expression not
a function) and I have changed all uses of fn to expr. Unfortunately,
I tested it using `fn'.

Hi,
   As a precaution against all the computers here (Griffith University,
Australia) going down with the Y2K bug, all the computers are going down.
The site that the R archives are on will be down for a number of days over
the new year, and the machine which actually creates the HTML archive
files will be down for longer.

Apologies for the disruption.

Message-ID: <199912211639.RAA02470@pubhealth.ku.dk>



In RW0.651 and RW0.901,
I discovered some unexpected behaviour when I used as.matrix.data.frame()

> matrix('"', 2, 2)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,] "\"" "\""
[2,] "\"" "\""
> unclass(as.data.frame(matrix('"', 2, 2)))

$V2
[1] "\"" "\""

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2"
> as.matrix(as.data.frame(matrix('"', 2, 2)))
  V1     V2
1 "\\\"" "\\\""
2 "\\\"" "\\\""


I traced it back to a call to format (probably .Internal(format, ...))

> format('"')
[1] "\\\""

> format('\\')
[1] "\\\\"

Same in format.char() but not in formatC()

This behaviour of format() is not intended, is it?

I think the problem was S-PLUS 5.0r[123]: 5.1's [ltr]apply seem fast again.

The key is to write a fast internal lapply and use that for the others.

No, but as the .Call introduction has a cut-down version, I might as
well take a look.

Actually, I misread: outer is quite slow but it does not use apply!

Now that is unexpected. The components should be factors. The code
converting matrices to data frames is not behaving as the prototype,
and that explains the rest, as the prototype gets the answer you would
expect. The rule is supposed to be that adding a matrix is equivalent to
adding each column in turn (White Book, page 59, and the S code).

I am not aware of any documentation of an R difference here (but I may be
wrong, although I checked the FAQ), and we need to fix either
as.data.frame.matrix or as.matrix.data.frame.  I will argue for the first.

I suspect it is.  What is going on here is that you are not expected to
feed the results of format to print, but to cat etc. formatC both formats
and prints.  Compare

> zz <- '"'
> zzz <- format(zz)
> print(zz)
[1] "\""
> print(zzz)
[1] "\\\""
> cat(zz, "\n")
" 
> cat(zzz, "\n")
\" 

The prototype does the same.  One can argue that the conventions
are sub-optimal, but that is what R-like languages do.

I would be happy to try a re-write of apply based around a fast lapply if
that was helpful.

Thank you for the bug report!

It also crashes on our Solaris platform, and with the newest "developers"
version.  
However, *only* when no device has been created previously in the current R
session, i.e., PREpending 

	par("usr") ; dev.off()

to your three commands gives the correct error message
  >>> Error in par(args) : parameter "tck" has the wrong length

Remark / Question :

 I think I would rather not have my students use low-level functions such
 as   plot.new()  and  plot.window()...

 Is there a reason they need these instead of  plot()/lines()/.... etc ?

Definitely.  The docs say that it (in fact, as.data.frame()) will do
type conversion, but it simply does not.

While fiddling with apply I noticed that there appears to be an error in
the dimnames, which actually show in the example.

     x <- cbind(x1 = 3, x2 = c(4:1, 2:5))
     dimnames(x)[[1]] <- letters[1:8]

First:

     apply(x, 2, sort)

I don't think the row names should not be retained here as they are not
common to all columns.

Second:

     cave <- function(x, c1,c2) c(mean(x[c1]),mean(x[c2]))
     apply(x,1, cave,  c1="x1", c2=c("x1","x2"))

I don't think the row names should be c("x1", "x2") which are left over
from the object x, but should be determined by the function cave, even to
the extent of not being present at all (the fact that cave returns a
vector of length 2 is just a coincidence).

I've attached a new apply (Apply) which takes care of these two problems,
at the cost of an extra lapply, anticipating an internal lapply shortly to
speed everything up.  Basically if FUN returns a vector and that vector
has common names across the columns (or, more generally, across MARGIN)
then these names are used to label the first extent; otherwise no names
are used.

Cheers, Jonathan.

Progress report!

1) This is nothing specific to aov. It can be repoduced by

response <- rnorm(60)
dag <- gl(3,2,60) 
model.matrix(formula = response ~ dag/response)

2) The crash occurs because a 60x3 (rather than 60x6) matrix is allocated,
so lots of writing outside the matrix occurs.

3) model.matrix(~ dag + response:dag) works, but has a slightly different
terms structure.

4) S generates a 60x5 matrix, which looks wrong to me.

Subject: BUG in format()? (PR#383)
Message-ID: <199912221332.OAA10020@pubhealth.ku.dk>



Dear Prof. Brian Ripley,

Thank you for your quick reply. It might be that we have two problems here.

(1) BUG in as.data.frame.matrix()
I must admit I was not aware that of the not-converting-to-factor
inconsistence here
(at the end of this mail more on this).

(2) BUG in as.matrix.data.frame()
My problem was that as.matrix.data.frame REALLY CHANGES THE DATA which
DEFINITTELY IS A BUG
It is totally legal to have a character column in a dataframe

> x <- as.data.frame(x=I(rep('"', 3)))

as expected it is
> unclass(x)
$x
[1] "\"" "\"" "\""
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2" "3"

here a first problem, well this is only printing
> x
     x
1 \\\"
2 \\\"
3 \\\"


but now look at this
correct:
> x[1,1]
[1] "\""

wrong:
> as.matrix(x)[1,1]
[1] "\\\""

this is not only a printing problem
correct:
> cat(x[1,1], "\n")
"

wrong:
> cat(as.matrix(x)[1,1], "\n")
\"

but DEFINITELY WRONG as can be seen in

> as.matrix(x)[1,1] == x[1,1]
[1] FALSE

It is caused, because as.matrix.data.frame makes use of format, and format
behaves as it does.
If, "that is what R-like languages do", then

(either) this convention about what format() does is not sub-optimal but
wrong
(or)     format MUST NEVER be used within R routines EXCEPT FOR PRINTING,
         i.e. formatting something and storing it or returning it from a
function is dangerous.
         Even the use for cat() may be dangerous, as cat() as a side effect
may store data,
         as in write() or write.table(). This deserves a BIG warning in the
documentation of format.

Here is a list of functions of package:base making use of format

> collect <- character()
> for (i in ls("package:base")){
+   if (   any(grep("format[(]", deparse(get(i, pos="package:base"))))
+       || any(grep("format.default[(]", deparse(get(i,
pos="package:base"))))
+      )collect <- c(collect, i)
+ }
> collect
 [1] "add1.default"          "add1.glm"              "add1.lm"
"all.equal.numeric"
 [5] "anovalist.lm"          "as.matrix.data.frame"  "drop1.default"
"drop1.glm"
 [9] "drop1.lm"              "format.char"           "format.default"
"format.pval"
[13] "help.search"           "hist.default"          "legend"
"ls.print"
[17] "print.aov"             "print.aovlist"         "print.coefmat"
"print.dummy.coef"
[21] "print.glm"             "print.glm.null"        "print.htest"
"print.lm"
[25] "print.mtable"          "print.summary.glm"     "print.summary.lm"
"print.summary.lm.null"
[29] "print.tables.aov"      "print.ts"              "quantile.default"
"step"
[33] "str.default"           "summary.aov"           "summary.data.frame"
"summary.default"
[37] "summary.infl"          "symnum"


To my understanding, at least as.matrix.data.frame() needs a fix.


Back to automatic conversion of characters to factors.

After fixing as.data.frame.matrix(), the following comparisions will be TRUE
or FALSE, depending whether mat is a numeric matrix or a character matrix:

  all( unclass(as.data.frame(mat)) == unclass(mat) )
  all( mat == sapply(as.data.frame(mat), FUN=function(x)x) )

Obviously automatic conversion to factors is a design decision long ago, but
I am not convinced yet, however.
The need to maintain attribute "AsIs" just to grant that a basic data type
(character) remains unchanged, appears to be somewhat dangerous. So both,
character data and factors need maintaining, in EACH FUNCTION that might
work on dataframes. Uff! It is easy to predict that errors will happen:

Some systematic testing ...

> char <- letters[1:2]
> fac <- factor(char)
> dd <- data.frame(char=I(char), fac=fac)

reveals that

> dd[,"char"] <- char
> dd[,"char"]
[1] a b
Levels:  a b

but
> dd$char <- char
> dd$char
[1] "a" "b"

So .Primitive("$<-") is inconsistent with automatically converting chars to
factors, as it allows to insert a pure character column into a dataframe,
which neither has attribute "AsIs" nor class "factor".

Handling I() is risky as well:

> mat <- matrix(letters, 2, 2)
> dimnames(mat) <- list(c(1:2), c("x","y"))
> mat
  x   y
1 "a" "c"
2 "b" "d"

> dd <- data.frame(I(mat))
> ddd
  I.mat..x I.mat..y
1        a        a
2        b        b
3        c        c

doesn't look too bad,
but
> dimnames(dd)
[[1]]
[1] "1" "2"

[[2]]
[1] "I.mat."

> str(ddd)
`data.frame':     3 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ I.mat.: chr [1:3, 1:2] "a" "b" "c" "a" "b" "c"
  ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  .. ..$ : NULL
  .. ..$ : chr  "x" "y"
  ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "AsIs"
>

So this dataframe is no longer a simple list with each element representing
one column, and thus

> sapply(ddd, FUN=function(x)x)
     I.mat.
[1,] "a"
[2,] "b"
[3,] "c"
[4,] "a"
[5,] "b"
[6,] "c"

is no longer a matrix.

Back to "AsIs":

> ddd[,1]
     x   y
[1,] "a" "a"
[2,] "b" "b"
[3,] "c" "c"
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

So here the whole matrix is "AsIs", and since matrix subscribting probably
doesn't  maintain "AsIs"
> ddd[[1]][, 1]
[1] "a" "b" "c"

"AsIs" is gone.

Jens,

I think we have established that format probably works as intended, and
that there is a bug in as.matrix.data.frame that I have just corrected.

Personally, I suspect that is you want to use " and \ in character strings
it is too much to expect consistent handling over all conversions.
That S has similar inconsistencies and yet I have never heard a complaint
suggests that it is a very rare requirement.

Right, nailed it.  The problem is the do_modelmatrix attempts to remove the
response if it occurs on the rhs by declaring it to generate zero columns.
Thus all interactions including the response were declared to have zero
columns too, but they were being generated.

As far as I can see the prototype drops the response if it occurs on its
own as a main effect, but keeps in all interactions.  I've altered
R's code to do the same. The results are not the same in this example
as they interpret the interaction differently: I think R's is probably
right, but as this is not a real example the important thing is to
self-consistent.

Subject: as.matrix.data.frame() modifies content of character columns (PR#386)
Message-ID: <199912221523.QAA12780@pubhealth.ku.dk>



If you have the following dataframe:

> x <- data.frame(x=I(rep('"', 3)))

then

> as.matrix(x)[1,1] == x[1,1]
[1] FALSE

which seems to be WRONG to me.

Also I don't understand
> x
     x
1 \\\"
2 \\\"
3 \\\"


Details
=======

As expected
> unclass(x)
$x
[1] "\"" "\"" "\""
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2" "3"


but now look at this
correct:
> x[1,1]
[1] "\""

wrong:
> as.matrix(x)[1,1]
[1] "\\\""

this is not only a printing problem
correct:
> cat(x[1,1], "\n")
"

wrong:
> cat(as.matrix(x)[1,1], "\n")
\"


Interpretation
==============

To my understanding, this is caused, because as.matrix.data.frame makes use
of format, and format does

> cat(format('"'), "\n")
\"

If this is the cause and format() does right, then consequently

         format MUST NEVER be used within R routines EXCEPT FOR PRINTING,
         i.e. formatting something and storing it or returning it from a

         Even the use for cat() may be dangerous, as cat() as a side effect

Simply drop it, without any replacement/improvement on its way?

Not that I would need it, but we certainly lack functionality in
experimental design ...

I'm copying this to R-devel because I think the warning messages might
be improved a bit (and I'm not sure what the problem is but there may
also be a bug). I think the install.packages() and update.packages()
mechanism is very exciting. It speeds and simplifies updates, which is
very important when things are changing as rapidly as they are now
changing, but it still has a few rough edges.

First of all, you might try install.packages(c("tseries", "VR")) or some
other packages directly from CRAN to see if you get a similar error.
Installing from my server by setting contriburl is still somewhat
experimental (and perhaps unorthodox).  Syskern and tframe are standard
packages, but dse is a bundle of two packages together. This is
something new in R 0.90.1 which I don't think was supported in 0.90.0.

Also, I think install.packages is only supported in Unix so far, and it
depends on another utility which you may have to install. My Linux
distribution had wget installed, but I had to install it on my Solaris
system. (I got it from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu.) There can be
additional problems with firewalls and proxy servers. If you do not want
to install this way yet, you can download the three tar.gz files from by
web site and install them in the standard way, but I think you will be
impressed with install.packages() when it works.

Install.packages uses download.file() which by default tries to
determine if you have cp, wget, or lynx for getting a file from a server
on the Internet. The message "sh: wget: command not found" suggests you
do not have wget and, if I understand things correctly, download.files
has already not found cp and will next try lynx. If it does not find
lynx it returns the message "No download method found", and since you
did not get that message I think lynx must have been found. I get the
"argument 'lib' is missing ..." warning, but it does not seem to be a
problem. It may be a problem if you do not have write permission in the
directory where R is installed.

I can't tell what program cannot find the object x. If you can generate
the error again and then do traceback() it would be helpful. I tried to
generate the error this morning running Linux from home, and have
generated some other problems you may watch out for, but not that one.
On the first attempted my Internet connection stalled on dse, but the
first two packages installed ok. On my second attempt everything worked
ok, except I was running on a machine which did not have a fortran
compiler. The warning about this was very hard to see with all the other
output that is generated. (R-devel: I think --quiet to wget would be a
better default and it would be nice if the output from R INSTALL could
be surpressed except for error and warning messages. Possibly this can
be accomplished simply by redirecting the output to a scatch file and
grepping for warnings and errors.) On the third attempt, as with my
attempts yesterday, everything worked ok.

I will be out of the office for the next two weeks. I'm sorry to leave
you without better suggestions about the problem. If there are not other
suggestions from R-devel you may want to try the more traditional
install (downloading the files gunzip and un-tar, then R INSTALL ...)

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Right.

Also fully supported on Windows, but you need wget.exe (which we put on
CRAN) or lynx.exe.

It is a warning. You are supposed to specify where you want the files
put (in which local library).   If you do not, it will pick the first in 
the list (.lib.loc) and tell you what it has done, in case it surprises
you. As Paul G says. you may need to specify an alternative. (The help
file does point out that you will get a warning: it always helps to read
the help, if only so you can tell us it is not good enough!)

I just sent a message to the r-help list with some advice on using
install.packages.  I said

 Note that as of version 0.90.1 you can get the MASS, nnet, spatial,
 and class libraries in a single bundle with
  install.packages("VR")   # packages from the Venables and Ripley bundle
 You do need to set the CRAN option to a legitimate CRAN archive site,
 have access to the Internet, and have either the wget or lynx programs
 on your search path.

 The default for options("CRAN") is cran.r-project.org.  You may want
 to use cran.dk.r-project.org, the Danish mirror, instead.

(The message was to a Danish user of R.  Other CRAN mirror locations
are listed at http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

To use this system you must have either wget or lynx installed so the
package file can be automatically downloaded via http.  (If people
know of other programs that will do a batch download of a file via
http, please tell us.)  You should ensure that options("CRAN") is set
to a nearby CRAN archive.  Because I am in the United States my
~/.Rprofile file contains
 ### $Id:$
 ### .Rprofile for Douglas Bates

 options(CRAN="http://cran.us.r-project.org/")

All of this applies to the Unix/Linux versions of R.  As I understand
it, the Windows version can use install.packages() but only after you
have manually transferred the .zip file for the package to the local
filesystem.  At that point you could use the rwinst.exe installer
instead.  Brian Ripley or Guido Masarotto may want to give the
definitive word on what can be done in the Windows version.

Subject: different subscripting behaviour using  $<-  or  [<-  for data.frames (PR#387)

I observe if

then

and

> dd$char <- char
> dd$char
[1] "a" "b"

are different.

After the latter operation the data.frame contains a character column, which
neither has attribute "AsIs" nor has been converted to class factor. Is this
intended?

doesn't look too bad,
but,
has only one column name:

This dataframe is not a simple list with each element representing one

Consequently, e.g.

This is the Right Thing:  we use the fact that multicolumn things can be a
single column of a data frame in logistic regression and extensively in
the survival analysis functions (and probably other places).  However, it
does make it hard to turn a character matrix into a data frame.  Perhaps
there should be an option of some sort?

  I will try to add something of this sort during next XMax holidays.
  Kurt, I am pretty sure that I will need your help for this and also for 
  the base distribution since I want to try to port the 
  png, jpeg and bmp devices now working under Windows (and
  so I need some compiler switch to know if libpng, jpeg...
  are installed). More after the attempt.

Works fine here... 

Which flavour of linux is doing that to you? Did you install from
prepackaged binaries or compile R yourself? (I've had one report
saying that demo(graphics) crashed in RH6.0 when installing from .rpm)

Could you please try debugging a little further?

Try /path/to/R -d gdb, run, recreate the crash, and tell us what gdb
says at that that point and the first couple of line of "bt" output
might also be useful.

I've added a line in rbind.data.frame() which removes all length 0
arguments.  This solves the problems you describe and passes make check,
but I am not sure if we really want it ...

I think I agree that we don't want it!

or does the following still work after your fix?

Well, my computer is not connected to my alarm clock (yet...). Bad
habit, but it's so nice and quiet at that time and I had some stuff I
wanted to get written down. (You stand a much worse chance of catching
me early in the morning.)

"bt" (backtrace) is just a gdb command which you type at the (gdb)
prompt, but never mind. The output below suffices in this case (but if
it were inside a utility routine called from multiple places, I would
have wanted to know where it was called from).

Obviously, this shouldn't crash R, but the only reason I can see that
it might happen is if the scalable fonts are absent *and* the Adobe
fonts are not present in both 75dpi and 100dpi versions. I seem to
recall that RH6.0 had a bug in the font server setup somewhat to that
effect (causing Netscape to crash all over the place). So what is in
your /etc/X11/fs/config ? Mine (RH6.1+modif.) has:

catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc,

        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,

Message-ID: <199912281346.OAA08271@pubhealth.ku.dk>


If you plot a vector of numbers which are all very similar
(i.e. within the range of some eps), the y-axis is not drawn
correctly. Either it is completely missing and there is an additional
horizontal line (1st example below) or it is longer than the plotting
region (2nd example).


x <- c(0.12345678912345678,0.12345678912345679,0.12345678912345676)
plot(x)

y <- c(0.9999563255363383973418, 0.9999563255363389524533, 0.9999563255363382863194)

Nice to know that you got it working, but it still puzzles me that it
broke. Unless, perhaps, you happen not to have the 100dpi fonts
installed...

(BTW: Things look much nicer with the urw fonts in RH6.1...)

This one works for me on Solaris and Linux (though with Linux the label

On Solaris (with a somewhat old version of R) this causes an infinite loop
(interruptable by C-c) in pretty0

(It's not too high priority to fix, but confusing data.entry and

Subject: dataframes in glm (PR#392)
Message-ID: <199912291322.OAA04095@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the glm documentation, an optional dataframe can be
supplied in data=. It would be nice if any object that can be coerced
to a dataframe (as.data.frame) were accepted. I am thinking of my data
objects. As it stands, I have to use data=as.data.frame(object) in
glm.
  As far as I can see, the only change required is to add a line in
models.R. After l.216:

if(missing(data))
	data <- sys.frame(sys.parent())

add

else if(!is.data.frame(data)&&!is.environment(data))
	data <- as.data.frame(data)

I don't think this should have adverse effects elsewhere and would
make life easier for the users of my libraries.
  Thanks. Jim

Subject: network outage for omegahat.org, r-project.org, and madisonlinux.org
Message-ID: <6r7lhwdu9g.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

As described below, external network connections to the campus of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison will be either inaccessible or slow
from 20:00 CST 2000/01/03 until 01:00 CST 2000/01/04.  CST is our
local time zone: Central Standard Time in North America.  These local
times correspond to 04:00 - 07:00 GMT Tuesday 2000/01/04.

This planned outage will affect the r-project.org, omegahat.org, and
madisonlinux.org domains because the name servers for those domains
and some of the primary http servers for those domains are here.

Those of us on this campus hope to be so occupied with celebrating a
victory by the Wisconsin Badgers football team in the Rose Bowl game
(to be played on January 1) that we won't notice this outage. :-)

DoIT Network Engineering will be changing the UW's autonomous system

disabling all off-campus connectivity.  Internal network traffic will
not be affected.  Off-campus connectivity will be re-established in
stages, so throughput to some sites may appear slow at first, and should
increase with time.  Full throughput should be re-established by 1am.

There's a not-so-short  "stop.list" of functions which are *NOT* tested for
segfaults.   dataentry (w/ and w/o ".") is among them.
all the interactive ones are, actually.
[[remember:   The list was quite a bit shorter, and there were R core

Look in  ..../tests/make-no-segfault.R for the statements starting with

 edit.int <- c("fix", "edit", "vi", "emacs", "pico", "xemacs", "xedit")
 misc.int <- c("browser", "bug.report", "menu")
 stop.list[["base"]] <-
    ..

to find all the functions which are *not* tested for seg.faults.

Maybe we (R-core) we should really always have
      R_TESTLOTS=yes
in our environments?

# [1] 1              yes

This is correct: it is your expectations that are wrong. It helps to
look at the result.

> X=="a"
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
FALSE
[13] FALSE
> X=="d"
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
FALSE
[13] FALSE
> X[X=="a"]
[1] a  a  a  a  a  NA
Levels:  a b


What is going on is that the NA results are regarded as genuinely unknown.
So the sixth entry may or may not be "a": we just don't know. So the
only thing we can do is to record NA.  And that applies when we subset too.
It might also be "d".

Now if you may meant NA to be a _level_ of the factor, use

> X <- factor(x, exclude="")
> X[X=="a"]
[1] a a a a a
Levels:  a b NA 

which might be what you expected. That treats NA as missing and known not
to be "a" nor "b".

Subject: density(kernel = "cosine") .. the `wrong cosine' ..
Message-ID: <14404.61675.357953.94472@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

I'm in teaching mode,  kernel densities.

{History:  density() was newly introduced in version 0.15,  19 Dec 1996;
	   most probably by Ross or Robert
}

When I was telling the students about different kernels (and why their
choice is not so important, and "equivalent bandwidths" etc,etc)
I wondered about the "Cosine" in my teaching notes which 
is defined there as

   k(x) = pi/4 * cos(pi/2 * x) *  I{ |x| <= 1 }
i.e. in R
  Kcos <- function(x) ifelse(abs(x) <= 1, pi/4 * cos(pi/2 * x), 0)

Now, R has instead (for bandwidth  h <- bw/1.135724  which makes the bandwidth
		    Gaussian equivalent;	     
		    here just h == 1/pi to be similar to above)
  
  Kcosine <- function(x) ifelse(abs(x) < 1, (1+cos(x*pi))/2 , 0)

I've looked in Dave Scott's (and Haerdle's "Smoothing... in S") book,
(Silverman doesn't mention any cosine kernel)
and both define the cosine kernel as I have it in my notes.

With above R code, look at

   x <- seq(-1.2,1.2,len=501)
   matplot(x, cbind(Kcos(x),Kcosine(x)), type='l', lty=1)

The big difference :

  - R's version is smooth (differentiable at the border of support)
  - Scott's (not really "his", of course!) version is not differentiable
    but looks much closer to the Epanechnikov kernel and is hence almost
    as `good' (less than half a percent of MSE loss w.r.t Epanechnikov).


Problem:

 - An average user knowing some statistics literature will most probably
   assume that a "cosine" kernel means the one in the literature, 
   *NOT* the one we have in R now.

Proposition / Possibilities / RFC [= Request For Comments] :

 - We CHANGE the behavior of  density(* , kernel="cosine")
   to use the cosine from the litterature.

 - provide the current "cosine" as  kernel = "smoothcosine"
   {I'd like to keep the possibility of 1-initial-letter abbreviation}


Enhancement (easy, I'll do that):

  - We further provide both
    Epanechnikov and "quartic" aka "biweight" additionally
    in any case.

Or they have know what is in S (or what V&R say it is). (Yes, we knew of
the discrepancy, so defined it.)

I am against that. S compatibility and all that.

OK, or

3) As it is confusing and never used(?), drop it altogether.

You may find it hard to get agreement on what those are (the problem
being the scale factors).

After peeking at Octave, I think I'd prefer reverting to something close
to the orginal suggestion.  Would

#ifdef const
# define yyconst const
#else
# define yyconst
#endif

SEXP            mkString(yyconst char *);

...

work?

-k

(The #ifdef part would go in after the #include statements in gram.y.)

I've looked in MASS 3rd ed., before my post; but didn't find that remark...
(now I did : middle of p.134).

But then, our density() is not S compatible 
(and the help page has always said so) anyway,
and doesn't want to copy
some of that sillynesses (default bandwidth; gaussian factor of 2 [or 4?]),..

that's against S compatibility as well.

That shouldn't matter as long as I provide an `equivalent bandwidth'
factor, should it?
I think nobody can assume that something like
   ``density with Epanechnikov kernel & bandwidth 2'' is universally well
defined.  But one should be able to easily compute an Epanechnikov kernel
estimate -- automatically using "equivalent bandwidths".

I'll change that.

BTW, there are good reasons for them to be "messed up" in the master
CVS archive.  What I will do is modify the script that updates the
copies of the archive that are visible through rsync.

Not cleaned up from last time, rather. It seems to affect files
modified between Nov 9 and 22. Files are owned by bates, group bates,
so we have to wait for Doug to fix this. The R-0.90-PATCHES directory
is also affected, BTW.

Interesting. There is no plot.aov on my system: this is using plot.lm.  
And I get no error.  It could be random, except this has nothing to do with
the data, only the labelling.

The error message means that ylab23 in NULL. I don't see how that can
happen with the system version of plot.lm.

My guess is masking. Do you have a local plot.lm?  Does this happen if
you start R with --vanilla?

I don't see it either. Is this completely reproducible? What is even
more confusing is that ylab23 was used to label the preceding plot,
just ca. 15 lines before. Did that give a normal y label?

Well, since I'm often the one asking for S compatibility, I thought I should say
that, over the years, I have had so much trouble with S plotting that I am sure
there is a better way. My graphs are not very demanding and have always worked
fairly well in R. I'll wait on the new changes before I do any fine tuning.

One thing I would like to see is a clear separation between the parameters one
should use in programs and the ones that should be tweaked to get things right
on a particular platform/monitor/graphics card.  I think this is mostly done
already and perhaps I just need to find the documentation, but it is not clear
to me which catagory pointsize fits into.

You are quite right.  I had an experimental version of plot.lm()
lying around.  I should have thought of that.

You are quite right.  I had an experimental version of plot.lm()
lying around.  I should have thought of that.

0.99.0 *unreleased* you mean (snapshot). Actually this lags 0.90.0
Patched (the release branch snapshot) at the moment, since the
bugfixes have not been merged into the development version. 

Your problem is due to this line in the filled.contour function

layout(matrix(c(2, 1), nc = 2), widths = c(1, lcm(3)))

Works better if you set it to lcm(4). We'll be changing the default
font sizes in the next patch release due to common demand, so this may
go away all by itself, but it is a bit nasty to have a fixed width
in there.

In S 3 or 4 this works because functions are lists, in R they are not
lists. 

More worrying is 

	a<-list(one=sin,two=lm)
	a[[2]]<-sort  #fails
	a$two<-sort     #succeeds

Nope. Didn't know about that one. Works in S3 as well (and should
work in R, obviously). Thanks for pointing it out.

Subject: Inconsistent messages with [[ list indexing (PR#359)
Message-ID: <199912041416.PAA12018@pubhealth.ku.dk>

R 0.90.0:

> Empl <- list(aa=1, b=2, c=3)
> Empl[[as.numeric(NA)]]
Error in Empl[[as.numeric(NA)]] : subscript out of bounds
> Empl[[as.integer(NA)]]
Error: attempt to select more than one element
> Empl[[as.logical(NA)]]
Error: attempt to select more than one element

Now,

(a) None of those messages is appropriate.

(b) At least the first two should be the same.

(c) S gives NULL in each case.

Is there any reason not to follow S here?  If so, I would prefer a
specific error message (`NA cannot be used to select a list element').

The usage

Empl[[ match("a", names(Empl)) ]]

is a very convenient one to defeat partial matching, but the current
behaviour of R defeats it. OK,

Empl[ match("a", names(Empl)) ] [[1]]

works, but this is an ugly hack (and the answer should I believe be the
same as [[ ]]).

gunzip followed by bzip2, I think. (Checks: 1241Kb) Do you actually mean an
MS-DOS floppy? Most people use VFAT file systems on floppies these days,
including Windows. You can't write those file names to an MS-DOS floppy.
(Our computing officer did manage to set up RH6 Linux to use msdos,
though.)

I assume that the script used needs adjusting.  I have never bothered with
this: I just split a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) into 1400Kb chunks and
concatenate on the target machine.

This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

A 'bt' command to make gdb show where *in R* you get into that kind of
trouble... iofflush.c is probably inside glibc somewhere and you don't
have the source. Looks like a configuration/build/install kind of
error, so what did you do to deserve the above?

Well, actually only one [the other went to R-core alone]
Here it is :

 To: R-bugs
 Subject: plot math - segfault and "frac", "^" bug(s)..
 Date: 8 Dec 1999 12:50:44 +0100

This is in R versions 0.65, 0.90.0, and the current "pre-release",
both on Linux and Solaris
[with x11() , but most probably not device dependent].

The following shows it all :

    plot(1,type='n')

    ## Frac doesn't shrink properly...
    text(.7,1.3,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=1)
    text(.7,1.2,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=3)

    ## Bug in precedency rule of  "^" :
    text(.7, 1,   expression( Phi^{-1}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)
    text(1.1,1,   expression( {Phi^{-1}}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)

    ## This segfaults :
    text(.9, 1,   expression( Phi^ -1 (frac(3,4))),cex=3)

Subject: pch==NA (PR#366)
Message-ID: <199912081733.SAA22746@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Try this:

plot(1:3,pch=c(1,2,NA))

The 3rd point is plotted as if pch were 1. This seems completely wrong
to me. Similar issue with cex= (you get the minimum size plotting dot
for the NA case there). With col= the point disappears, as I tend it
should in the other cases as well.

Subject: plot math - segfault and "frac", "^" bug(s).. (PR#368)
Message-ID: <199912081734.SAA22785@pubhealth.ku.dk>

       [this didn't go out at noon time during our e-mail storm...]

In R versions 0.65, 0.90.0, and the current "pre-release",
both on Linux and Solaris (the segfault at least)
[with x11() , but most probably not device dependent].

The following shows it all :

    plot(1,type='n')

    ## Frac doesn't shrink properly...
    text(.7,1.3,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=1)
    text(.7,1.2,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=3)

    ## Bug in precedency rule of  "^" :
    text(.7, 1,   expression( Phi^{-1}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)
    text(1.1,1,   expression( {Phi^{-1}}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)

    ## This segfaults :
    text(.9, 1,   expression( Phi^ -1 (frac(3,4))),cex=3)

Whoops. Now we have it in triplicate after I fixed the mail setup.
Please respond to this one (PR#365) *only*!

 Dear R-developers,

 recently I sent a bug report about plot(aov()) crashing R (resp. the
 X Windows part of R) without reporting the data I used.

 In the meantime, I discovered, that the problem is due to a .RData
 file -- without it, there is no crash, with that .RData loaded, the
 following small sequence of commands crashes R 0.90, too, on my
 machine. R had been started with "--vsize 16M --nsize 4000k":

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 > x <- data.frame(id=rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 100), val=rnorm(1:300))
 > plot(aov(val ~ id, data=x))
 Hit <Return> to see next plot: 
 Hit <Return> to see next plot: 
 Hit <Return> to see next plot: 
 X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
   Major opcode of failed request:  53 (X_CreatePixmap)
     Value in failed request:  0x0
       Serial number of failed request:  1229
         Current serial number in output stream:  1235

	 Process R exited abnormally with code 1 at Wed Dec  8 19:25:58 1999

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prof. Ripley suggested that it might be a XFree86 error, so I'll give
 you my X version, too (from X -showconfig):
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System
 (protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6300)
 Release Date: January 4 1999
         If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is newer
	         than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting
		         problems.  (see http://www.XFree86.Org/FAQ)
			 Operating System: Linux 2.0.36 i686 [ELF]
			 Configured drivers:
			   Mach64: accelerated server for ATI Mach64 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ... maybe I should upgrade my X windows system :-|

 I'll include the base64-encoded .RData file in gzipped form below. For
 me, the "problem" is solved, but maybe there is somebody in the
 development team who is interested in more details ...
  

 Regards, Ulf

Reproduce without the .RData file with

 X11(point=16,h=5,w=5)
 x <- data.frame(id=rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 100), val=rnorm(1:300))
 plot(aov(val ~ id, data=x))

(The X11 thing was in .First)

Fritz,

I have slightly adapted (didn't work before) "tsboot" from the "boot"
library to the current time series conventions of R. The following patch
will do that. I suggest to apply this patch to the file
"boot/R/bootfuns.q" of the "boot" library at CRAN.

Adrian,

Thank you for the patches.

You need to send such things to the package maintainer, as mentioned in the
DESCRIPTION, in this case me. I knew tsboot would not work: it is by no
means the only thing in boot that does not work (yet): see PORTING.
I have delayed a serious attempt on those until the optimizer problems
are sorted out.

Most examples with \testonly in are partially or completely repeated:

?cat

<...>

Examples:

     ## print an informative message
     cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

     ## print an informative message
     cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

The drop_full_command processing in Rdconvlib.pl seems flawed.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.9912090944170.646-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  Can we add a note to the documentation that setting par(fig) resets
par(mfrow) and par(mfcol) to c(1,1)?
  Or are mfrow and mfcol now deprecated in favor of all the split screen
stuff?  (I was spending the morning trying to write some code that plotted
multiple subplots within whatever plot region was active at the moment; I
was able to set and reset fig successfully, but got very confused as to
why par(mfg) was no longer advancing ...  I know that in principle
 
  opar <- par(no.readonly=TRUE)
   ...
  par(opar)

should have reset everything, but [for reasons I'm too lazy to analyze] it
didn't seem to be working.)

The documentation does not *promise* that names will survive, but in
Splus3.4, they do. This broke a function that worked under S+ that used
the names attribute of elements in the components returned by split.

I don't think that names in x should be preserved here.  The names of
the returned list are obtained from the levels of the split factor f
(which, in your case, are "1" and "2").

Paul:

This simply is not supported.  Look at parse.format() in the chron pkg.
What it does is

* if format has 5 chars, parse as "a/b/c"

* if format has 3 chars, parse as "abc"

* else parse as "a b c" (and do not abbreviate month names if "month" is
given.

In you example, we get

R> unlist(parse.format("yy/m/d"))
    abb     sep periods mon.abb 
"FALSE"     " "     "y"  "TRUE" 

and hence we only get the years.

Hope this helps.

Subject: SAS XPORT Transport Format
Message-ID: <m11woG0-000ZSxC@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

A colleague pointed out that the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has adopted a transport format defined by SAS
Institute as a standard for electronic submissions of data.  As a
result, this format has been openly documented.

The URL for the documentation on the format is
       http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/technote/ts140.html

Information on the FDA standards for Electronic submissions is given at
       http://www.sas.com/software/industry/pht/fda/index.html

Has anyone written code to import data stored in this format into R?

Saikat DebRoy and I started reverse-engineering the format before our
colleague pointed out that it was openly documented.  It was a rather
interesting exercise because floating point format is _not_ an IEEE
format, it is an old format with a base 16 exponent, no hidden bit,
etc.  It takes me back to the days of punched cards, IBM mainframes,
JCL, ...

Well I've *thought* about doing it... And the SPSS format as well. And
DB3. And...

http://www.wotsit.org has tons of information on this sort of stuff.
(Although on SAS, it's just the TS140 again.) It's mentioned on the
Ideas list at developer.r-project.org (on a machine near you...), but
perhaps some elaboration would be in order there.

If you use the horiz= option with hist() you get the message:

Warning:
parameter "horiz" couldn't be set in high-level plot() function.

and the plot comes out vertical.  The documentation says this option comes from

barplot() and it does work correctly in barplot().

This message comes whether horiz= is set to FALSE or TRUE.

I have started a read.dbf routine, as part of the map manipulation
package i am working on in my "infinite" sparetime. I already
have C code to manipulate dbf, just need to adapt it for R

The warning message you are getting is just telling you that "horiz" is not
a valid argument to hist() (and that it is not a valid par() either).
"horiz" is quite specific to barplot().

what was the documentation that lead you to try "horiz" with hist() ?

paul

p.s.  you can "fake" a horizontal histogram using barplot.  for example, try
...

x<-rnorm(20)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), pty="s")
hist.info <- hist(x, breaks=-3:3)
barplot(hist.info$counts, space=0, horiz=T)
axis(2, labels=-3:3)

... but perhaps you would prefer it if we made it so that you could use
"horiz" with hist() ?

Try this code as separate lines entered interactively, then try doit()

doit<-function()
{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE)
t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE)
}

doit() apparently executes only the last of a series of t.test()s.

Maybe this is no bug, but I can't see why this behaviour is shown.

You need to print the answer: the last is printed by auto-printing.
More generally, if you want something printed in a function, you
need to print it explicitly. This applies to braced expressions too,
so

{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE)
t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE)
}

shows the effect.

What happens inside a function is not printed unless you ask for it.
You probably want something like

doit<-function()
{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
print(t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE))
print(t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE))
}

instead.

Along similar lines,  what are the prospects for grabbing the SPSS code

Message-ID: <199912131833.KAA12807@dvorak.Berkeley.EDU>

Paul,

Thank you for your quick reply.  The reason I thought horiz= would work with
hist() is that it does in Splus.  (I was converting an S script to R.)  In
Splus, help(hist) syntax denotes by ... "additional arguments to barplot".
However, I just noticed that in R, help(hist) denotes by ...  "further
graphical parameters to 'title' and 'axis'".

Please consider adding this functionality to hist().  In the mean time, I'll
try out your barplot() example as a possible replacement for my hist() command.
Thank you for providing it.

Fran Rizzardi

P.S. Please say hello to Ross for me if you see him.  He was a housemate of
mine in graduate school.

I think it quite likely that we could do pick up that code for use by
the R project.  Ben, could you point us to the part of PSPP where you
parse the SPSS .sav format (or whatever they call it)?

Saikat DebRoy and I are currently working on code to parse the SAS
XPORT data format and incorportate those files into R.  We can
certainly share that with you when it is complete.

You have a few choices here:

	1. Grab sfm-read.c, sfm-write.c, sfm.h, and sfmP.h in
           src/ in the PSPP distribution.

	2. Read through the comprehensive documentation on the
           format, also in the PSPP distribution.  See pspp.info
           or pspp.texi in doc/.

	3. I originally found the information on the format
           somewhere on spss.com.  You could probably find it
           there too.

PSPP also reads and write SPSS portable files.  You have the same
three choices here.

Sounds good.  I'm going to start up heavy PSPP development later
this week when final exams here are over.

Message-ID: <199912141155.MAA18651@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear Sirs,

Try the following simple r-program

a<-data.frame(1:10)
b<-matrix(NA,3,1)
z<-rbind(b,as.matrix(a))

While it works well i R0.64.1, it appears to be deleterious for R0.90.0.
When I run it, R crashes. I'm using Windows NT on a Pentium II system.

Please let me know if you need some other details.

Best regards
Claudio Lupi

Has been fixed for 0.90.1 a while ago.

Message-ID: <3857B0F8.859D3ECA@bank-banque-canada.ca>

    o   `Rcomplex' is preferred to `complex' (a future reserved word
        in C) for R complex objects passed to C.

I'm a bit confused here. Is "complex" or "Rcomplex" the future reserved
word in C (I thought "complex" already was, but I'm not a C programmer)
and is this because R storage modes should or should not have names
corresponding to C reserved words?  I presume this means I should use
something like

storage.mode(z) <- if (is.R()) "Rcomplex" else "complex"

Is that right?

However, machine() still returns "Unix" rather than "unix". (I'm not

machine() as standardized already, or is .Platform$OS.type the preferred

yes.  As a matter of fact, I think  machine() should become deprecated...

complex is not currently reserved, but it is in the draft stanadrd
revision.  (I might see the confusion. It does not say `to be passed to C',
and it means after passing to C.)

No! Use complex in interpreted R code and Rcomplex in C.

We will shortly have compatibility headers for the C code that covers this.

Foreign.Rd has not yet been updated to reflect this change, but
the Writing R Extensions manual has.

Saikat DebRoy and I have created a "foreign" package to read data in
formats stored by various well-known statistical packages.  The
read.stata function is already available in another package.
Saikat is currently working on a function to read SAS XPORT format.
I have created a read.mtp function for Minitab Portable Worksheet
format.  We will upload this package to CRAN by next week.

I think we will change all of these to read.foreign before uploading
and make it so the file name extension indicates the type of file.

I recently took "." off my PATH for security reasons and now find
that R does not work in my home directory where the .Renviron
file resides.

The fix is simple.  In the R shell startup section replace
". .Renviron" by ". ./.Renviron".  The relevant section is:

# Startup
if ${USE_R_ENVIRON}; then # use the one in current dir, or default
  if [ -r .Renviron ]
  then . ./.Renviron      # <<-- change
  else [ -r ${R_ENVIRON} ] && . ${R_ENVIRON}

Subject: aggregate.ts (PR#376)
Message-ID: <199912161315.OAA18954@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I'm having some problems with aggregate.ts, e.g.

R> x <- ts(1:20)
R> frequency(x)
[1] 1

R> aggregate(x, nfreq=1/3)
Error in aggregate.ts(x, nfreq = 1/3) : cannot change frequency from 1 to
0.333333333333333

In fact aggregate.ts only accepts a new frequency that is a negative
power of two in this example. 

The problem with the current test for compatible frequencies

    if ((ofrequency%%nfrequency) != 0)
        stop(paste("cannot change frequency from", ofrequency,
            "to", nfrequency))

is that numerical errors may cause it to fail.  I suggest

     if (abs(ofrequency%%nfrequency) < ts.eps)

instead.

It's been like that since January, and is OK on my machine. This is yet
another example in which the Linux run-time libraries are not
taking account that extended precision calculations are probably
inappropriate:
Browse[1]> ofrequency%%nfrequency
[1] 5.551115e-17
is half or one quarter the machine precision (depending on how you define it).
(We fixed 10 or so such examples a few releases ago where Linux was
differing from Solaris and also from Windows.)

I'll put in the test you suggest (with > not < !)  Should we be fixing
%%, that is if  y%%x is less than 5*machine precision times abs(x),
returning zero?  (I see S-PLUS does not.)

Could easily be changed, but I'd like to understand it first.  I cannot
reproduce the problem.  I never have `.' in my PATH and when I do

	cat > foo
	echo I am here
	CTRL-D
	. foo

I get "I am here".

Of course, this happens on Debian GNU/Linux.  Is this a system-specific
problem or feature?

Same as Clive Loaders #358 (Darn! I think we almost had a fix for that
one, but forgot to apply it. Thomas?)

In a Bourne shell or derivative thereof use a sequence like

R_VSIZE=10M
R_NSIZE=800K
export R_NSIZE R_VSIZE
R CMD check ...

In csh or tcsh use setenv instead.

Subject: plot()  after split.screen() on postscript() Device produces inconsistent PostScript file (PR#378)
Message-ID: <199912172032.VAA05044@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Boris Leykekhman
Version: 0.90.0
OS: Red Hat Linux 6.1
Submission from: (NULL) (131.136.242.1)


Problem:
Plot()  after split.screen() on postscript() Device produces PostScript file,
which crashes PS interpretter with error message: 
Error: /undefined in fg
To reproduce:
#----- Start R code
postscript("test.ps")
split.screen(c(2,2))
screen(1)
plot(c(1,2,3,4))
dev.off()
#----- End R code
Workaround:
Inserting the line with definition of  fg, taken from the correct PS file,
solved my problem.
The line is: 
/fg {0.0000 0.0000 0.0000} def fg rgb
It was inserted after:
%%EndProlog2

Description:

--------------------

> strsplit("acbdefgSPLIThigkilmnSpPqrst","SPLIT")
[[1]]
[1] "acbdefg"  "higkilmn" "p"        "qrst"  

--------------------

Apparently, it will 

Split the Strings in `x' into substrings according to the presence of
ANY CHARACTER FOUND IN substring `split'.

-------------------

Was this intended? I expected, as the documentation implies that the
result from above would be:

"acbdefg"   "higkilmnSpPqrst"

Yes it was intended. Strsplit interfaces to the strtok() C routine,

       char *strtok(char *s, const char *delim);

DESCRIPTION
       A `token' is a nonempty string of characters not occurring
       in the string delim, followed by  \0  or  by  a  character
       occurring in delim.

and `split' gets passed as `delim'. The documentation is bad, though.

Or put this in your ~/.Renviron file.  (You still need the export,
although this should be eliminated before 1.0.)

check runs R --vanilla, and that skips .Renviron and ~/.Renviron, so that
idea does not work (at least for me on 0.90.1).

The two tcl things by Guido are actually quite nice, at least as
proofs of concepts. With the right intro text, I'd say that they could
move to contrib.

I'd expect the ts things to be superseded by later events. Brian?

What a surprise! I had no idea anyone was interested in this stuff or had bothered even to put it forward...

This was originally my S-PLUS front end to some work of Miller & Nguyen on finding D-optimal designs with blocking.  Had I known someone was interested in porting it to R I may have found some time to work on it.  As it is I will not.  If the contributor (Halvorsen) does nothing more with it I think it should be just dropped.  There are problems with the Fortran and it would take some work to get it going.  The S code is unnecessarily complicated as well.  (I did it some time ago when I was younger and more ambitious...)

That's for their authors to say. I would regard bats as superseded by ts.
timeslab is a port to R of a port to S of some routines in a DOS package
accompanying a book by Newton, and so might be useful for users of that
book. My understanding is that the copyright had not been resolved: the
porter had not sought the author's permission. If there has been no
progress within a year I suggest we drop this.

I see ratetables is in Devel. This is part of survival4, separated
out to save space, so I think it should really be in Old.

The "bats" library is obsoleted by ts. I'm not doing any further

You are right.  Should we change that?  (The reason we have --vanilla is
because the R distribution uses the same, but this is probably a bad
idea for add-ons which may be KNOWN to need more memory.)

And, tcltk should take advantage of the configure/cleanup mechanism to

-- Happy holidays! --


Dear R Development Core Team,

I want to thank you *very much* for the new "Writing R Extensions" manual
published with RW0.901 and hope this is the right place to report some
possible typos.


page 17, example given in the middle of the page, I think it should read

REAL(version) = 3.0;
          ^^^^^^^


page 23, second example, I think the parameter definition should read

SEXP lapply2(SEXP list, SEXP fn, SEXP rho)
                                              ^^

and the last line of the function I guess should be

VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
                                  ^^^^^^^^

If my understanding is wrong or you discover another typo in the lapply2
example, please give me a short note.

Regards

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

It's not really new: it is a merge of the old Manual.tex and
R-external.texi that was distributed with 0.90.0. As 1.0 approaches we
are beginning to work hard on documentation.

The intention here was that the parameter be`expr' (it is an expression not
a function) and I have changed all uses of fn to expr. Unfortunately,
I tested it using `fn'.

Hi,
   As a precaution against all the computers here (Griffith University,
Australia) going down with the Y2K bug, all the computers are going down.
The site that the R archives are on will be down for a number of days over
the new year, and the machine which actually creates the HTML archive

Apologies for the disruption.

Message-ID: <199912211639.RAA02470@pubhealth.ku.dk>



In RW0.651 and RW0.901,
I discovered some unexpected behaviour when I used as.matrix.data.frame()

> matrix('"', 2, 2)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,] "\"" "\""
[2,] "\"" "\""
> unclass(as.data.frame(matrix('"', 2, 2)))
$V1
[1] "\"" "\""

$V2
[1] "\"" "\""

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2"
> as.matrix(as.data.frame(matrix('"', 2, 2)))
  V1     V2
1 "\\\"" "\\\""
2 "\\\"" "\\\""


I traced it back to a call to format (probably .Internal(format, ...))

> format('"')
[1] "\\\""

> format('\\')
[1] "\\\\"

Same in format.char() but not in formatC()

This behaviour of format() is not intended, is it?

I think the problem was S-PLUS 5.0r[123]: 5.1's [ltr]apply seem fast again.

The key is to write a fast internal lapply and use that for the others.

No, but as the .Call introduction has a cut-down version, I might as
well take a look.

Actually, I misread: outer is quite slow but it does not use apply!

Now that is unexpected. The components should be factors. The code
converting matrices to data frames is not behaving as the prototype,
and that explains the rest, as the prototype gets the answer you would
expect. The rule is supposed to be that adding a matrix is equivalent to
adding each column in turn (White Book, page 59, and the S code).

I am not aware of any documentation of an R difference here (but I may be
wrong, although I checked the FAQ), and we need to fix either
as.data.frame.matrix or as.matrix.data.frame.  I will argue for the first.

I suspect it is.  What is going on here is that you are not expected to
feed the results of format to print, but to cat etc. formatC both formats
and prints.  Compare

> zz <- '"'
> zzz <- format(zz)
> print(zz)
[1] "\""
> print(zzz)
[1] "\\\""
> cat(zz, "\n")
" 
> cat(zzz, "\n")
\" 

The prototype does the same.  One can argue that the conventions
are sub-optimal, but that is what R-like languages do.

I would be happy to try a re-write of apply based around a fast lapply if
that was helpful.

Thank you for the bug report!

It also crashes on our Solaris platform, and with the newest "developers"
version.  
However, *only* when no device has been created previously in the current R
session, i.e., PREpending 

	par("usr") ; dev.off()

to your three commands gives the correct error message
  >>> Error in par(args) : parameter "tck" has the wrong length

Remark / Question :

 I think I would rather not have my students use low-level functions such
 as   plot.new()  and  plot.window()...

 Is there a reason they need these instead of  plot()/lines()/.... etc ?

Definitely.  The docs say that it (in fact, as.data.frame()) will do
type conversion, but it simply does not.

While fiddling with apply I noticed that there appears to be an error in
the dimnames, which actually show in the example.

     x <- cbind(x1 = 3, x2 = c(4:1, 2:5))
     dimnames(x)[[1]] <- letters[1:8]

First:

     apply(x, 2, sort)

I don't think the row names should not be retained here as they are not
common to all columns.

Second:

     cave <- function(x, c1,c2) c(mean(x[c1]),mean(x[c2]))
     apply(x,1, cave,  c1="x1", c2=c("x1","x2"))

I don't think the row names should be c("x1", "x2") which are left over
from the object x, but should be determined by the function cave, even to
the extent of not being present at all (the fact that cave returns a
vector of length 2 is just a coincidence).

I've attached a new apply (Apply) which takes care of these two problems,
at the cost of an extra lapply, anticipating an internal lapply shortly to
speed everything up.  Basically if FUN returns a vector and that vector
has common names across the columns (or, more generally, across MARGIN)
then these names are used to label the first extent; otherwise no names
are used.

Cheers, Jonathan.

Progress report!

1) This is nothing specific to aov. It can be repoduced by

response <- rnorm(60)
dag <- gl(3,2,60) 
model.matrix(formula = response ~ dag/response)

2) The crash occurs because a 60x3 (rather than 60x6) matrix is allocated,
so lots of writing outside the matrix occurs.

3) model.matrix(~ dag + response:dag) works, but has a slightly different
terms structure.

4) S generates a 60x5 matrix, which looks wrong to me.

Subject: BUG in format()? (PR#383)
Message-ID: <199912221332.OAA10020@pubhealth.ku.dk>



Dear Prof. Brian Ripley,

Thank you for your quick reply. It might be that we have two problems here.

(1) BUG in as.data.frame.matrix()
I must admit I was not aware that of the not-converting-to-factor
inconsistence here
(at the end of this mail more on this).

(2) BUG in as.matrix.data.frame()
My problem was that as.matrix.data.frame REALLY CHANGES THE DATA which
DEFINITTELY IS A BUG
It is totally legal to have a character column in a dataframe

> x <- as.data.frame(x=I(rep('"', 3)))

as expected it is
> unclass(x)
$x
[1] "\"" "\"" "\""
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2" "3"

here a first problem, well this is only printing
> x
     x
1 \\\"
2 \\\"
3 \\\"


but now look at this
correct:
> x[1,1]
[1] "\""

wrong:
> as.matrix(x)[1,1]
[1] "\\\""

this is not only a printing problem
correct:
> cat(x[1,1], "\n")
"

wrong:
> cat(as.matrix(x)[1,1], "\n")
\"

but DEFINITELY WRONG as can be seen in

> as.matrix(x)[1,1] == x[1,1]
[1] FALSE

It is caused, because as.matrix.data.frame makes use of format, and format
behaves as it does.
If, "that is what R-like languages do", then

(either) this convention about what format() does is not sub-optimal but
wrong
(or)     format MUST NEVER be used within R routines EXCEPT FOR PRINTING,
         i.e. formatting something and storing it or returning it from a
function is dangerous.
         Even the use for cat() may be dangerous, as cat() as a side effect
may store data,
         as in write() or write.table(). This deserves a BIG warning in the
documentation of format.

Here is a list of functions of package:base making use of format

> collect <- character()
> for (i in ls("package:base")){
+   if (   any(grep("format[(]", deparse(get(i, pos="package:base"))))
+       || any(grep("format.default[(]", deparse(get(i,
pos="package:base"))))
+      )collect <- c(collect, i)
+ }
> collect
 [1] "add1.default"          "add1.glm"              "add1.lm"
"all.equal.numeric"
 [5] "anovalist.lm"          "as.matrix.data.frame"  "drop1.default"
"drop1.glm"
 [9] "drop1.lm"              "format.char"           "format.default"

"print.dummy.coef"
[21] "print.glm"             "print.glm.null"        "print.htest"
"print.lm"
[25] "print.mtable"          "print.summary.glm"     "print.summary.lm"

[37] "summary.infl"          "symnum"


To my understanding, at least as.matrix.data.frame() needs a fix.


Back to automatic conversion of characters to factors.

After fixing as.data.frame.matrix(), the following comparisions will be TRUE
or FALSE, depending whether mat is a numeric matrix or a character matrix:

  all( unclass(as.data.frame(mat)) == unclass(mat) )
  all( mat == sapply(as.data.frame(mat), FUN=function(x)x) )

Obviously automatic conversion to factors is a design decision long ago, but
I am not convinced yet, however.
The need to maintain attribute "AsIs" just to grant that a basic data type
(character) remains unchanged, appears to be somewhat dangerous. So both,
character data and factors need maintaining, in EACH FUNCTION that might
work on dataframes. Uff! It is easy to predict that errors will happen:

Some systematic testing ...

> char <- letters[1:2]
> fac <- factor(char)
> dd <- data.frame(char=I(char), fac=fac)

reveals that

> dd[,"char"] <- char
> dd[,"char"]
[1] a b
Levels:  a b

but
> dd$char <- char
> dd$char
[1] "a" "b"

So .Primitive("$<-") is inconsistent with automatically converting chars to
factors, as it allows to insert a pure character column into a dataframe,
which neither has attribute "AsIs" nor class "factor".

Handling I() is risky as well:

> mat <- matrix(letters, 2, 2)
> dimnames(mat) <- list(c(1:2), c("x","y"))
> mat
  x   y
1 "a" "c"
2 "b" "d"

> dd <- data.frame(I(mat))
> ddd
  I.mat..x I.mat..y
1        a        a
2        b        b
3        c        c

doesn't look too bad,
but
> dimnames(dd)
[[1]]
[1] "1" "2"

[[2]]
[1] "I.mat."

> str(ddd)
`data.frame':     3 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ I.mat.: chr [1:3, 1:2] "a" "b" "c" "a" "b" "c"
  ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  .. ..$ : NULL
  .. ..$ : chr  "x" "y"
  ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "AsIs"
>

So this dataframe is no longer a simple list with each element representing
one column, and thus

> sapply(ddd, FUN=function(x)x)
     I.mat.
[1,] "a"
[2,] "b"
[3,] "c"
[4,] "a"
[5,] "b"
[6,] "c"

is no longer a matrix.

Back to "AsIs":

> ddd[,1]
     x   y
[1,] "a" "a"
[2,] "b" "b"
[3,] "c" "c"
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

So here the whole matrix is "AsIs", and since matrix subscribting probably
doesn't  maintain "AsIs"
> ddd[[1]][, 1]
[1] "a" "b" "c"

"AsIs" is gone.

I think we have established that format probably works as intended, and
that there is a bug in as.matrix.data.frame that I have just corrected.

Personally, I suspect that is you want to use " and \ in character strings
it is too much to expect consistent handling over all conversions.
That S has similar inconsistencies and yet I have never heard a complaint
suggests that it is a very rare requirement.

Right, nailed it.  The problem is the do_modelmatrix attempts to remove the
response if it occurs on the rhs by declaring it to generate zero columns.
Thus all interactions including the response were declared to have zero
columns too, but they were being generated.

As far as I can see the prototype drops the response if it occurs on its
own as a main effect, but keeps in all interactions.  I've altered
R's code to do the same. The results are not the same in this example
as they interpret the interaction differently: I think R's is probably
right, but as this is not a real example the important thing is to
self-consistent.

Subject: as.matrix.data.frame() modifies content of character columns (PR#386)
Message-ID: <199912221523.QAA12780@pubhealth.ku.dk>



If you have the following dataframe:

> x <- data.frame(x=I(rep('"', 3)))

then

> as.matrix(x)[1,1] == x[1,1]
[1] FALSE

which seems to be WRONG to me.

Also I don't understand
> x
     x
1 \\\"
2 \\\"
3 \\\"


Details
=======

As expected
> unclass(x)
$x
[1] "\"" "\"" "\""
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2" "3"


but now look at this
correct:
> x[1,1]
[1] "\""

wrong:
> as.matrix(x)[1,1]
[1] "\\\""

this is not only a printing problem
correct:
> cat(x[1,1], "\n")
"

wrong:
> cat(as.matrix(x)[1,1], "\n")
\"


Interpretation
==============

To my understanding, this is caused, because as.matrix.data.frame makes use
of format, and format does

> cat(format('"'), "\n")
\"

If this is the cause and format() does right, then consequently

         format MUST NEVER be used within R routines EXCEPT FOR PRINTING,
         i.e. formatting something and storing it or returning it from a
function is dangerous.
         Even the use for cat() may be dangerous, as cat() as a side effect
may store data,
         as in write() or write.table(). This deserves a BIG warning in the
documentation of format.

Here is a list of functions of package:base making use of format

> collect <- character()
> for (i in ls("package:base")){
+   if (   any(grep("format[(]", deparse(get(i, pos="package:base"))))
+       || any(grep("format.default[(]", deparse(get(i,
pos="package:base"))))
+      )collect <- c(collect, i)
+ }

Simply drop it, without any replacement/improvement on its way?

Not that I would need it, but we certainly lack functionality in
experimental design ...

I'm copying this to R-devel because I think the warning messages might
be improved a bit (and I'm not sure what the problem is but there may
also be a bug). I think the install.packages() and update.packages()
mechanism is very exciting. It speeds and simplifies updates, which is
very important when things are changing as rapidly as they are now
changing, but it still has a few rough edges.

First of all, you might try install.packages(c("tseries", "VR")) or some
other packages directly from CRAN to see if you get a similar error.
Installing from my server by setting contriburl is still somewhat
experimental (and perhaps unorthodox).  Syskern and tframe are standard
packages, but dse is a bundle of two packages together. This is
something new in R 0.90.1 which I don't think was supported in 0.90.0.

Also, I think install.packages is only supported in Unix so far, and it
depends on another utility which you may have to install. My Linux
distribution had wget installed, but I had to install it on my Solaris
system. (I got it from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu.) There can be
additional problems with firewalls and proxy servers. If you do not want
to install this way yet, you can download the three tar.gz files from by
web site and install them in the standard way, but I think you will be
impressed with install.packages() when it works.

Install.packages uses download.file() which by default tries to
determine if you have cp, wget, or lynx for getting a file from a server
on the Internet. The message "sh: wget: command not found" suggests you
do not have wget and, if I understand things correctly, download.files
has already not found cp and will next try lynx. If it does not find
lynx it returns the message "No download method found", and since you
did not get that message I think lynx must have been found. I get the
"argument 'lib' is missing ..." warning, but it does not seem to be a
problem. It may be a problem if you do not have write permission in the
directory where R is installed.

I can't tell what program cannot find the object x. If you can generate
the error again and then do traceback() it would be helpful. I tried to
generate the error this morning running Linux from home, and have
generated some other problems you may watch out for, but not that one.
On the first attempted my Internet connection stalled on dse, but the
first two packages installed ok. On my second attempt everything worked
ok, except I was running on a machine which did not have a fortran
compiler. The warning about this was very hard to see with all the other
output that is generated. (R-devel: I think --quiet to wget would be a
better default and it would be nice if the output from R INSTALL could
be surpressed except for error and warning messages. Possibly this can
be accomplished simply by redirecting the output to a scatch file and
grepping for warnings and errors.) On the third attempt, as with my
attempts yesterday, everything worked ok.

I will be out of the office for the next two weeks. I'm sorry to leave
you without better suggestions about the problem. If there are not other
suggestions from R-devel you may want to try the more traditional
install (downloading the files gunzip and un-tar, then R INSTALL ...)

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Right.

Also fully supported on Windows, but you need wget.exe (which we put on
CRAN) or lynx.exe.

It is a warning. You are supposed to specify where you want the files
put (in which local library).   If you do not, it will pick the first in 
the list (.lib.loc) and tell you what it has done, in case it surprises
you. As Paul G says. you may need to specify an alternative. (The help
file does point out that you will get a warning: it always helps to read
the help, if only so you can tell us it is not good enough!)

I just sent a message to the r-help list with some advice on using
install.packages.  I said

 Note that as of version 0.90.1 you can get the MASS, nnet, spatial,
 and class libraries in a single bundle with
  install.packages("VR")   # packages from the Venables and Ripley bundle
 You do need to set the CRAN option to a legitimate CRAN archive site,
 have access to the Internet, and have either the wget or lynx programs
 on your search path.

 The default for options("CRAN") is cran.r-project.org.  You may want
 to use cran.dk.r-project.org, the Danish mirror, instead.

(The message was to a Danish user of R.  Other CRAN mirror locations
are listed at http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

To use this system you must have either wget or lynx installed so the
package file can be automatically downloaded via http.  (If people
know of other programs that will do a batch download of a file via
http, please tell us.)  You should ensure that options("CRAN") is set
to a nearby CRAN archive.  Because I am in the United States my
~/.Rprofile file contains
 ### $Id:$
 ### .Rprofile for Douglas Bates

 options(CRAN="http://cran.us.r-project.org/")

All of this applies to the Unix/Linux versions of R.  As I understand
it, the Windows version can use install.packages() but only after you
have manually transferred the .zip file for the package to the local
filesystem.  At that point you could use the rwinst.exe installer
instead.  Brian Ripley or Guido Masarotto may want to give the
definitive word on what can be done in the Windows version.

Subject: different subscripting behaviour using  $<-  or  [<-  for data.frames (PR#387)
Message-ID: <199912231815.TAA21687@pubhealth.ku.dk>



I observe if

> char <- letters[1:2]
> fac <- factor(char)
> dd <- data.frame(char=I(char), fac=fac)

then

> dd[,"char"] <- char
> dd[,"char"]
[1] a b
Levels:  a b

and

> dd$char <- char
> dd$char
[1] "a" "b"

are different.

After the latter operation the data.frame contains a character column, which
neither has attribute "AsIs" nor has been converted to class factor. Is this
intended?

This is the Right Thing:  we use the fact that multicolumn things can be a
single column of a data frame in logistic regression and extensively in
the survival analysis functions (and probably other places).  However, it
does make it hard to turn a character matrix into a data frame.  Perhaps
there should be an option of some sort?

  Kurt, I am pretty sure that I will need your help for this and also for 
  the base distribution since I want to try to port the 
  png, jpeg and bmp devices now working under Windows (and
  so I need some compiler switch to know if libpng, jpeg...
  are installed). More after the attempt.

Works fine here... 

Which flavour of linux is doing that to you? Did you install from
prepackaged binaries or compile R yourself? (I've had one report
saying that demo(graphics) crashed in RH6.0 when installing from .rpm)

Could you please try debugging a little further?

Try /path/to/R -d gdb, run, recreate the crash, and tell us what gdb
says at that that point and the first couple of line of "bt" output
might also be useful.

I've added a line in rbind.data.frame() which removes all length 0
arguments.  This solves the problems you describe and passes make check,
but I am not sure if we really want it ...

I think I agree that we don't want it!

or does the following still work after your fix?

Well, my computer is not connected to my alarm clock (yet...). Bad
habit, but it's so nice and quiet at that time and I had some stuff I
wanted to get written down. (You stand a much worse chance of catching
me early in the morning.)

"bt" (backtrace) is just a gdb command which you type at the (gdb)
prompt, but never mind. The output below suffices in this case (but if
it were inside a utility routine called from multiple places, I would
have wanted to know where it was called from).

Obviously, this shouldn't crash R, but the only reason I can see that
it might happen is if the scalable fonts are absent *and* the Adobe
fonts are not present in both 75dpi and 100dpi versions. I seem to
recall that RH6.0 had a bug in the font server setup somewhat to that
effect (causing Netscape to crash all over the place). So what is in
your /etc/X11/fs/config ? Mine (RH6.1+modif.) has:

catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1,

Subject: axis for small ranges (PR#390)
Message-ID: <199912281346.OAA08271@pubhealth.ku.dk>


If you plot a vector of numbers which are all very similar
(i.e. within the range of some eps), the y-axis is not drawn
correctly. Either it is completely missing and there is an additional
horizontal line (1st example below) or it is longer than the plotting
region (2nd example).


x <- c(0.12345678912345678,0.12345678912345679,0.12345678912345676)
plot(x)

y <- c(0.9999563255363383973418, 0.9999563255363389524533, 0.9999563255363382863194)

Nice to know that you got it working, but it still puzzles me that it
broke. Unless, perhaps, you happen not to have the 100dpi fonts
installed...

(BTW: Things look much nicer with the urw fonts in RH6.1...)

On Solaris (with a somewhat old version of R) this causes an infinite loop

(It's not too high priority to fix, but confusing data.entry and

Subject: dataframes in glm (PR#392)
Message-ID: <199912291322.OAA04095@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the glm documentation, an optional dataframe can be
supplied in data=. It would be nice if any object that can be coerced
to a dataframe (as.data.frame) were accepted. I am thinking of my data
objects. As it stands, I have to use data=as.data.frame(object) in
glm.
  As far as I can see, the only change required is to add a line in
models.R. After l.216:

if(missing(data))
	data <- sys.frame(sys.parent())

add

else if(!is.data.frame(data)&&!is.environment(data))
	data <- as.data.frame(data)

I don't think this should have adverse effects elsewhere and would
make life easier for the users of my libraries.
  Thanks. Jim

Message-ID: <6r7lhwdu9g.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

As described below, external network connections to the campus of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison will be either inaccessible or slow
from 20:00 CST 2000/01/03 until 01:00 CST 2000/01/04.  CST is our
local time zone: Central Standard Time in North America.  These local
times correspond to 04:00 - 07:00 GMT Tuesday 2000/01/04.

This planned outage will affect the r-project.org, omegahat.org, and
madisonlinux.org domains because the name servers for those domains
and some of the primary http servers for those domains are here.

Those of us on this campus hope to be so occupied with celebrating a
victory by the Wisconsin Badgers football team in the Rose Bowl game
(to be played on January 1) that we won't notice this outage. :-)

DoIT Network Engineering will be changing the UW's autonomous system

disabling all off-campus connectivity.  Internal network traffic will
not be affected.  Off-campus connectivity will be re-established in
stages, so throughput to some sites may appear slow at first, and should
increase with time.  Full throughput should be re-established by 1am.

There's a not-so-short  "stop.list" of functions which are *NOT* tested for
segfaults.   dataentry (w/ and w/o ".") is among them.
all the interactive ones are, actually.
[[remember:   The list was quite a bit shorter, and there were R core
	      members who complained...]] 

Look in  ..../tests/make-no-segfault.R for the statements starting with

 edit.int <- c("fix", "edit", "vi", "emacs", "pico", "xemacs", "xedit")
 misc.int <- c("browser", "bug.report", "menu")
 stop.list[["base"]] <-
    ..

to find all the functions which are *not* tested for seg.faults.

Maybe we (R-core) we should really always have
      R_TESTLOTS=yes
in our environments?

This is correct: it is your expectations that are wrong. It helps to
look at the result.

> X=="a"
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
FALSE
[13] FALSE
> X=="d"
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
FALSE
[13] FALSE
> X[X=="a"]
[1] a  a  a  a  a  NA
Levels:  a b


What is going on is that the NA results are regarded as genuinely unknown.
So the sixth entry may or may not be "a": we just don't know. So the
only thing we can do is to record NA.  And that applies when we subset too.
It might also be "d".

Now if you may meant NA to be a _level_ of the factor, use

> X <- factor(x, exclude="")
> X[X=="a"]
[1] a a a a a
Levels:  a b NA 

which might be what you expected. That treats NA as missing and known not
to be "a" nor "b".

Subject: density(kernel = "cosine") .. the `wrong cosine' ..
Message-ID: <14404.61675.357953.94472@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

I'm in teaching mode,  kernel densities.

{History:  density() was newly introduced in version 0.15,  19 Dec 1996;
	   most probably by Ross or Robert
}

When I was telling the students about different kernels (and why their
choice is not so important, and "equivalent bandwidths" etc,etc)
I wondered about the "Cosine" in my teaching notes which 
is defined there as

   k(x) = pi/4 * cos(pi/2 * x) *  I{ |x| <= 1 }
i.e. in R
  Kcos <- function(x) ifelse(abs(x) <= 1, pi/4 * cos(pi/2 * x), 0)

Now, R has instead (for bandwidth  h <- bw/1.135724  which makes the bandwidth
		    Gaussian equivalent;	     
		    here just h == 1/pi to be similar to above)
  
  Kcosine <- function(x) ifelse(abs(x) < 1, (1+cos(x*pi))/2 , 0)

I've looked in Dave Scott's (and Haerdle's "Smoothing... in S") book,
(Silverman doesn't mention any cosine kernel)
and both define the cosine kernel as I have it in my notes.

With above R code, look at

   x <- seq(-1.2,1.2,len=501)
   matplot(x, cbind(Kcos(x),Kcosine(x)), type='l', lty=1)

The big difference :

  - R's version is smooth (differentiable at the border of support)
  - Scott's (not really "his", of course!) version is not differentiable
    but looks much closer to the Epanechnikov kernel and is hence almost
    as `good' (less than half a percent of MSE loss w.r.t Epanechnikov).


Problem:

 - An average user knowing some statistics literature will most probably
   assume that a "cosine" kernel means the one in the literature, 
   *NOT* the one we have in R now.

Proposition / Possibilities / RFC [= Request For Comments] :

 - We CHANGE the behavior of  density(* , kernel="cosine")
   to use the cosine from the litterature.

 - provide the current "cosine" as  kernel = "smoothcosine"
   {I'd like to keep the possibility of 1-initial-letter abbreviation}


Enhancement (easy, I'll do that):

  - We further provide both
    Epanechnikov and "quartic" aka "biweight" additionally
    in any case.

Or they have know what is in S (or what V&R say it is). (Yes, we knew of
the discrepancy, so defined it.)

I am against that. S compatibility and all that.

You may find it hard to get agreement on what those are (the problem
being the scale factors).

After peeking at Octave, I think I'd prefer reverting to something close
to the orginal suggestion.  Would

#ifdef const
# define yyconst const
#else
# define yyconst
#endif

SEXP            mkString(yyconst char *);

...

work?

-k

(The #ifdef part would go in after the #include statements in gram.y.)

I've looked in MASS 3rd ed., before my post; but didn't find that remark...
(now I did : middle of p.134).

But then, our density() is not S compatible 
(and the help page has always said so) anyway,
and doesn't want to copy
some of that sillynesses (default bandwidth; gaussian factor of 2 [or 4?]),..

that's against S compatibility as well.
*AND* we make it `impossible' to do what was possible earlier.

That shouldn't matter as long as I provide an `equivalent bandwidth'
factor, should it?
I think nobody can assume that something like
   ``density with Epanechnikov kernel & bandwidth 2'' is universally well
defined.  But one should be able to easily compute an Epanechnikov kernel
estimate -- automatically using "equivalent bandwidths".

I'll change that.

BTW, there are good reasons for them to be "messed up" in the master
CVS archive.  What I will do is modify the script that updates the
copies of the archive that are visible through rsync.

Not cleaned up from last time, rather. It seems to affect files
modified between Nov 9 and 22. Files are owned by bates, group bates,
so we have to wait for Doug to fix this. The R-0.90-PATCHES directory
is also affected, BTW.

Interesting. There is no plot.aov on my system: this is using plot.lm.  
And I get no error.  It could be random, except this has nothing to do with
the data, only the labelling.

The error message means that ylab23 in NULL. I don't see how that can
happen with the system version of plot.lm.

My guess is masking. Do you have a local plot.lm?  Does this happen if
you start R with --vanilla?

I don't see it either. Is this completely reproducible? What is even
more confusing is that ylab23 was used to label the preceding plot,
just ca. 15 lines before. Did that give a normal y label?

Well, since I'm often the one asking for S compatibility, I thought I should say
that, over the years, I have had so much trouble with S plotting that I am sure
there is a better way. My graphs are not very demanding and have always worked
fairly well in R. I'll wait on the new changes before I do any fine tuning.

One thing I would like to see is a clear separation between the parameters one
should use in programs and the ones that should be tweaked to get things right
on a particular platform/monitor/graphics card.  I think this is mostly done
already and perhaps I just need to find the documentation, but it is not clear
to me which catagory pointsize fits into.

You are quite right.  I had an experimental version of plot.lm()
lying around.  I should have thought of that.

0.99.0 *unreleased* you mean (snapshot). Actually this lags 0.90.0
Patched (the release branch snapshot) at the moment, since the
bugfixes have not been merged into the development version. 

Your problem is due to this line in the filled.contour function

layout(matrix(c(2, 1), nc = 2), widths = c(1, lcm(3)))

Works better if you set it to lcm(4). We'll be changing the default
font sizes in the next patch release due to common demand, so this may
go away all by itself, but it is a bit nasty to have a fixed width
in there.

In S 3 or 4 this works because functions are lists, in R they are not
lists. 

More worrying is 

	a<-list(one=sin,two=lm)
	a[[2]]<-sort  #fails
	a$two<-sort     #succeeds

Nope. Didn't know about that one. Works in S3 as well (and should
work in R, obviously). Thanks for pointing it out.

Subject: Inconsistent messages with [[ list indexing (PR#359)
Message-ID: <199912041416.PAA12018@pubhealth.ku.dk>

R 0.90.0:

> Empl <- list(aa=1, b=2, c=3)
> Empl[[as.numeric(NA)]]
Error in Empl[[as.numeric(NA)]] : subscript out of bounds
> Empl[[as.integer(NA)]]
Error: attempt to select more than one element
> Empl[[as.logical(NA)]]
Error: attempt to select more than one element

Now,

(a) None of those messages is appropriate.

(b) At least the first two should be the same.

(c) S gives NULL in each case.

Is there any reason not to follow S here?  If so, I would prefer a
specific error message (`NA cannot be used to select a list element').

The usage

Empl[[ match("a", names(Empl)) ]]

is a very convenient one to defeat partial matching, but the current
behaviour of R defeats it. OK,

Empl[ match("a", names(Empl)) ] [[1]]

works, but this is an ugly hack (and the answer should I believe be the
same as [[ ]]).

gunzip followed by bzip2, I think. (Checks: 1241Kb) Do you actually mean an
MS-DOS floppy? Most people use VFAT file systems on floppies these days,
including Windows. You can't write those file names to an MS-DOS floppy.
(Our computing officer did manage to set up RH6 Linux to use msdos,
though.)

I assume that the script used needs adjusting.  I have never bothered with
this: I just split a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) into 1400Kb chunks and
concatenate on the target machine.

Subject: "function" function -- infinite loops and bus error [not user problem] (PR#361)
Message-ID: <199912061119.MAA21252@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The following is in "all" versions of R,
but is not really a bug that users will stumble about.

Still should be fixed 
(making sure that performance is not degraded by the fix ..)


 f <- get("function")

 f(,) ##-- gives INFINITE loop; breakable with <ctrl> c.
 f(NULL,)# [and other variants] as well

 f(F,F)

 >> Bus error  and R is killed.

Subject: Bug list summary (automatic post)
Message-ID: <199912070615.HAA30203@biostat.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

A 'bt' command to make gdb show where *in R* you get into that kind of
trouble... iofflush.c is probably inside glibc somewhere and you don't
have the source. Looks like a configuration/build/install kind of
error, so what did you do to deserve the above?

Subject: CRAN.packages (PR#364)
Message-ID: <199912070924.KAA03181@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I had to make the following modifications to parse.dcf() in order to get
CRAN.packages() to work. 
Original:

    ok <- grep("^[ \t]+$", text)
    if (length(ok) > 0) {
        text <- text[!ok]
    }

Fixed:

    notok <- grep("^[ \t]+", text)
    if (length(notok) > 0) { 
        text <- text[-notok]
    }

 To: R-bugs
 Subject: plot math - segfault and "frac", "^" bug(s)..
 Date: 8 Dec 1999 12:50:44 +0100

This is in R versions 0.65, 0.90.0, and the current "pre-release",
both on Linux and Solaris
[with x11() , but most probably not device dependent].

The following shows it all :

    plot(1,type='n')

    ## Frac doesn't shrink properly...
    text(.7,1.3,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=1)
    text(.7,1.2,  expression( frac(7,4) == 1 * frac(3,4)), cex=3)

    ## Bug in precedency rule of  "^" :
    text(.7, 1,   expression( Phi^{-1}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)
    text(1.1,1,   expression( {Phi^{-1}}(frac(3,4))),cex=3)

    ## This segfaults :
    text(.9, 1,   expression( Phi^ -1 (frac(3,4))),cex=3)

Message-ID: <199912081733.SAA22746@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Try this:

plot(1:3,pch=c(1,2,NA))

The 3rd point is plotted as if pch were 1. This seems completely wrong
to me. Similar issue with cex= (you get the minimum size plotting dot
for the NA case there). With col= the point disappears, as I tend it
should in the other cases as well.

 Dear R-developers,

 recently I sent a bug report about plot(aov()) crashing R (resp. the
 X Windows part of R) without reporting the data I used.

 In the meantime, I discovered, that the problem is due to a .RData
 file -- without it, there is no crash, with that .RData loaded, the
 following small sequence of commands crashes R 0.90, too, on my
 machine. R had been started with "--vsize 16M --nsize 4000k":

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 > x <- data.frame(id=rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 100), val=rnorm(1:300))
 > plot(aov(val ~ id, data=x))

 Hit <Return> to see next plot:

 X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
   Major opcode of failed request:  53 (X_CreatePixmap)
     Value in failed request:  0x0
       Serial number of failed request:  1229
         Current serial number in output stream:  1235

	 Process R exited abnormally with code 1 at Wed Dec  8 19:25:58 1999

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prof. Ripley suggested that it might be a XFree86 error, so I'll give
 you my X version, too (from X -showconfig):
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System
 (protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6300)
 Release Date: January 4 1999
         If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is newer
	         than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting
		         problems.  (see http://www.XFree86.Org/FAQ)
			 Operating System: Linux 2.0.36 i686 [ELF]
			 Configured drivers:
			   Mach64: accelerated server for ATI Mach64 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ... maybe I should upgrade my X windows system :-|

 I'll include the base64-encoded .RData file in gzipped form below. For
 me, the "problem" is solved, but maybe there is somebody in the
 development team who is interested in more details ...

Reproduce without the .RData file with

 X11(point=16,h=5,w=5)
 x <- data.frame(id=rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 100), val=rnorm(1:300))
 plot(aov(val ~ id, data=x))

(The X11 thing was in .First)

Fritz,

I have slightly adapted (didn't work before) "tsboot" from the "boot"
library to the current time series conventions of R. The following patch
will do that. I suggest to apply this patch to the file
"boot/R/bootfuns.q" of the "boot" library at CRAN.

Adrian,

Thank you for the patches.

You need to send such things to the package maintainer, as mentioned in the
DESCRIPTION, in this case me. I knew tsboot would not work: it is by no
means the only thing in boot that does not work (yet): see PORTING.
I have delayed a serious attempt on those until the optimizer problems
are sorted out.

Subject: estonly confuses examples (PR#370)
Message-ID: <199912091352.OAA02285@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Most examples with \testonly in are partially or completely repeated:

?cat

<...>

Examples:

     ## print an informative message
     cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

     ## print an informative message
     cat("iteration = ", iter <- iter + 1, "\n")

The drop_full_command processing in Rdconvlib.pl seems flawed.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.9912090944170.646-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  Can we add a note to the documentation that setting par(fig) resets
par(mfrow) and par(mfcol) to c(1,1)?
  Or are mfrow and mfcol now deprecated in favor of all the split screen
stuff?  (I was spending the morning trying to write some code that plotted
multiple subplots within whatever plot region was active at the moment; I
was able to set and reset fig successfully, but got very confused as to
why par(mfg) was no longer advancing ...  I know that in principle
 
  opar <- par(no.readonly=TRUE)
   ...
  par(opar)

should have reset everything, but [for reasons I'm too lazy to analyze] it
didn't seem to be working.)

The documentation does not *promise* that names will survive, but in
Splus3.4, they do. This broke a function that worked under S+ that used
the names attribute of elements in the components returned by split.

I don't think that names in x should be preserved here.  The names of
the returned list are obtained from the levels of the split factor f
(which, in your case, are "1" and "2").

Paul:

This simply is not supported.  Look at parse.format() in the chron pkg.
What it does is

* if format has 5 chars, parse as "a/b/c"

* if format has 3 chars, parse as "abc"

* else parse as "a b c" (and do not abbreviate month names if "month" is
given.

In you example, we get

R> unlist(parse.format("yy/m/d"))
    abb     sep periods mon.abb 
"FALSE"     " "     "y"  "TRUE" 

and hence we only get the years.

Hope this helps.

Subject: SAS XPORT Transport Format
Message-ID: <m11woG0-000ZSxC@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

A colleague pointed out that the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has adopted a transport format defined by SAS
Institute as a standard for electronic submissions of data.  As a
result, this format has been openly documented.

The URL for the documentation on the format is
       http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/technote/ts140.html

Information on the FDA standards for Electronic submissions is given at
       http://www.sas.com/software/industry/pht/fda/index.html

Has anyone written code to import data stored in this format into R?

Saikat DebRoy and I started reverse-engineering the format before our
colleague pointed out that it was openly documented.  It was a rather
interesting exercise because floating point format is _not_ an IEEE
format, it is an old format with a base 16 exponent, no hidden bit,
etc.  It takes me back to the days of punched cards, IBM mainframes,
JCL, ...

Well I've *thought* about doing it... And the SPSS format as well. And
DB3. And...

http://www.wotsit.org has tons of information on this sort of stuff.
(Although on SAS, it's just the TS140 again.) It's mentioned on the
Ideas list at developer.r-project.org (on a machine near you...), but
perhaps some elaboration would be in order there.

If you use the horiz= option with hist() you get the message:

Warning:
parameter "horiz" couldn't be set in high-level plot() function.

and the plot comes out vertical.  The documentation says this option comes from

barplot() and it does work correctly in barplot().

This message comes whether horiz= is set to FALSE or TRUE.

I have started a read.dbf routine, as part of the map manipulation
package i am working on in my "infinite" sparetime. I already
have C code to manipulate dbf, just need to adapt it for R

The warning message you are getting is just telling you that "horiz" is not
a valid argument to hist() (and that it is not a valid par() either).
"horiz" is quite specific to barplot().

what was the documentation that lead you to try "horiz" with hist() ?

paul

p.s.  you can "fake" a horizontal histogram using barplot.  for example, try
...

x<-rnorm(20)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), pty="s")
hist.info <- hist(x, breaks=-3:3)
barplot(hist.info$counts, space=0, horiz=T)
axis(2, labels=-3:3)

... but perhaps you would prefer it if we made it so that you could use
"horiz" with hist() ?

Try this code as separate lines entered interactively, then try doit()

doit<-function()

y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE)
t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE)
}

doit() apparently executes only the last of a series of t.test()s.

Maybe this is no bug, but I can't see why this behaviour is shown.

You need to print the answer: the last is printed by auto-printing.
More generally, if you want something printed in a function, you
need to print it explicitly. This applies to braced expressions too,
so

{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE)
t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE)
}

shows the effect.

What happens inside a function is not printed unless you ask for it.
You probably want something like

doit<-function()
{
x<-seq(1,10)
y1<-x+rnorm(10,1,1.5)
y2<-x+rnorm(10,1,1)
print(t.test(x,y1,paired=TRUE))
print(t.test(x,y2,paired=TRUE))
}

instead.

Along similar lines,  what are the prospects for grabbing the SPSS code

Message-ID: <199912131833.KAA12807@dvorak.Berkeley.EDU>

Paul,

Thank you for your quick reply.  The reason I thought horiz= would work with
hist() is that it does in Splus.  (I was converting an S script to R.)  In
Splus, help(hist) syntax denotes by ... "additional arguments to barplot".
However, I just noticed that in R, help(hist) denotes by ...  "further
graphical parameters to 'title' and 'axis'".

Please consider adding this functionality to hist().  In the mean time, I'll
try out your barplot() example as a possible replacement for my hist() command.
Thank you for providing it.

Fran Rizzardi

P.S. Please say hello to Ross for me if you see him.  He was a housemate of
mine in graduate school.

I think it quite likely that we could do pick up that code for use by
the R project.  Ben, could you point us to the part of PSPP where you
parse the SPSS .sav format (or whatever they call it)?

Saikat DebRoy and I are currently working on code to parse the SAS
XPORT data format and incorportate those files into R.  We can
certainly share that with you when it is complete.

You have a few choices here:

	1. Grab sfm-read.c, sfm-write.c, sfm.h, and sfmP.h in
           src/ in the PSPP distribution.

	2. Read through the comprehensive documentation on the
           format, also in the PSPP distribution.  See pspp.info
           or pspp.texi in doc/.

	3. I originally found the information on the format
           somewhere on spss.com.  You could probably find it
           there too.

PSPP also reads and write SPSS portable files.  You have the same
three choices here.

Sounds good.  I'm going to start up heavy PSPP development later
this week when final exams here are over.

Dear Sirs,

Try the following simple r-program

a<-data.frame(1:10)
b<-matrix(NA,3,1)
z<-rbind(b,as.matrix(a))

While it works well i R0.64.1, it appears to be deleterious for R0.90.0.
When I run it, R crashes. I'm using Windows NT on a Pentium II system.

Please let me know if you need some other details.

Has been fixed for 0.90.1 a while ago.

    o   `Rcomplex' is preferred to `complex' (a future reserved word
        in C) for R complex objects passed to C.

I'm a bit confused here. Is "complex" or "Rcomplex" the future reserved
word in C (I thought "complex" already was, but I'm not a C programmer)
and is this because R storage modes should or should not have names
corresponding to C reserved words?  I presume this means I should use
something like

storage.mode(z) <- if (is.R()) "Rcomplex" else "complex"

Is that right?

yes.  As a matter of fact, I think  machine() should become deprecated...

complex is not currently reserved, but it is in the draft stanadrd
revision.  (I might see the confusion. It does not say `to be passed to C',
and it means after passing to C.)

No! Use complex in interpreted R code and Rcomplex in C.

We will shortly have compatibility headers for the C code that covers this.

Foreign.Rd has not yet been updated to reflect this change, but
the Writing R Extensions manual has.

Saikat DebRoy and I have created a "foreign" package to read data in
formats stored by various well-known statistical packages.  The
read.stata function is already available in another package.
Saikat is currently working on a function to read SAS XPORT format.
I have created a read.mtp function for Minitab Portable Worksheet
format.  We will upload this package to CRAN by next week.

I think we will change all of these to read.foreign before uploading
and make it so the file name extension indicates the type of file.

Subject: R-0.90.1 buglet in R shell (PR#375)
Message-ID: <199912160120.CAA10945@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I recently took "." off my PATH for security reasons and now find
that R does not work in my home directory where the .Renviron
file resides.

The fix is simple.  In the R shell startup section replace
". .Renviron" by ". ./.Renviron".  The relevant section is:

# Startup
if ${USE_R_ENVIRON}; then # use the one in current dir, or default
  if [ -r .Renviron ]
  then . ./.Renviron      # <<-- change
  else [ -r ${R_ENVIRON} ] && . ${R_ENVIRON}
  fi
fi

Subject: aggregate.ts (PR#376)
Message-ID: <199912161315.OAA18954@pubhealth.ku.dk>

I'm having some problems with aggregate.ts, e.g.

R> x <- ts(1:20)
R> frequency(x)
[1] 1

R> aggregate(x, nfreq=1/3)
Error in aggregate.ts(x, nfreq = 1/3) : cannot change frequency from 1 to
0.333333333333333

In fact aggregate.ts only accepts a new frequency that is a negative
power of two in this example. 

The problem with the current test for compatible frequencies

    if ((ofrequency%%nfrequency) != 0)
        stop(paste("cannot change frequency from", ofrequency,
            "to", nfrequency))

is that numerical errors may cause it to fail.  I suggest

     if (abs(ofrequency%%nfrequency) < ts.eps)

instead.

It's been like that since January, and is OK on my machine. This is yet
another example in which the Linux run-time libraries are not
taking account that extended precision calculations are probably
inappropriate:
Browse[1]> ofrequency%%nfrequency
[1] 5.551115e-17
is half or one quarter the machine precision (depending on how you define it).
(We fixed 10 or so such examples a few releases ago where Linux was
differing from Solaris and also from Windows.)

I'll put in the test you suggest (with > not < !)  Should we be fixing
%%, that is if  y%%x is less than 5*machine precision times abs(x),
returning zero?  (I see S-PLUS does not.)

Could easily be changed, but I'd like to understand it first.  I cannot
reproduce the problem.  I never have `.' in my PATH and when I do

	cat > foo
	echo I am here
	CTRL-D
	. foo

I get "I am here".

Of course, this happens on Debian GNU/Linux.  Is this a system-specific
problem or feature?

Same as Clive Loaders #358 (Darn! I think we almost had a fix for that
one, but forgot to apply it. Thomas?)

In a Bourne shell or derivative thereof use a sequence like

R_VSIZE=10M
R_NSIZE=800K
export R_NSIZE R_VSIZE
R CMD check ...

In csh or tcsh use setenv instead.

Subject: plot()  after split.screen() on postscript() Device produces inconsistent PostScript file (PR#378)
Message-ID: <199912172032.VAA05044@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Boris Leykekhman
Version: 0.90.0
OS: Red Hat Linux 6.1
Submission from: (NULL) (131.136.242.1)


Problem:
Plot()  after split.screen() on postscript() Device produces PostScript file,
which crashes PS interpretter with error message: 
Error: /undefined in fg
To reproduce:
#----- Start R code
postscript("test.ps")
split.screen(c(2,2))
screen(1)
plot(c(1,2,3,4))
dev.off()
#----- End R code
Workaround:
Inserting the line with definition of  fg, taken from the correct PS file,
solved my problem.
The line is: 
/fg {0.0000 0.0000 0.0000} def fg rgb
It was inserted after:
%%EndProlog2

Description:

[[1]]
[1] "acbdefg"  "higkilmn" "p"        "qrst"  

--------------------

Apparently, it will 

Split the Strings in `x' into substrings according to the presence of
ANY CHARACTER FOUND IN substring `split'.

-------------------

Was this intended? I expected, as the documentation implies that the
result from above would be:

"acbdefg"   "higkilmnSpPqrst"

Yes it was intended. Strsplit interfaces to the strtok() C routine,

       char *strtok(char *s, const char *delim);

DESCRIPTION
       A `token' is a nonempty string of characters not occurring
       in the string delim, followed by  \0  or  by  a  character
       occurring in delim.

and `split' gets passed as `delim'. The documentation is bad, though.

*dopt*
     Finding D-optimal experimental designs.
*tcltk*
     Basic interface with Tcl/Tk.

which have all been there for a long time.

What is the current status, is any of the above getting ready for being

Or put this in your ~/.Renviron file.  (You still need the export,
although this should be eliminated before 1.0.)

check runs R --vanilla, and that skips .Renviron and ~/.Renviron, so that
idea does not work (at least for me on 0.90.1).

The two tcl things by Guido are actually quite nice, at least as
proofs of concepts. With the right intro text, I'd say that they could
move to contrib.

I'd expect the ts things to be superseded by later events. Brian?

What a surprise! I had no idea anyone was interested in this stuff or had bothered even to put it forward...

This was originally my S-PLUS front end to some work of Miller & Nguyen on finding D-optimal designs with blocking.  Had I known someone was interested in porting it to R I may have found some time to work on it.  As it is I will not.  If the contributor (Halvorsen) does nothing more with it I think it should be just dropped.  There are problems with the Fortran and it would take some work to get it going.  The S code is unnecessarily complicated as well.  (I did it some time ago when I was younger and more ambitious...)

That's for their authors to say. I would regard bats as superseded by ts.
timeslab is a port to R of a port to S of some routines in a DOS package
accompanying a book by Newton, and so might be useful for users of that
book. My understanding is that the copyright had not been resolved: the
porter had not sought the author's permission. If there has been no
progress within a year I suggest we drop this.

I see ratetables is in Devel. This is part of survival4, separated
out to save space, so I think it should really be in Old.

The "bats" library is obsoleted by ts. I'm not doing any further

You are right.  Should we change that?  (The reason we have --vanilla is
because the R distribution uses the same, but this is probably a bad
idea for add-ons which may be KNOWN to need more memory.)

And, tcltk should take advantage of the configure/cleanup mechanism to
provide for seemless installation.

-- Happy holidays! --


Dear R Development Core Team,

I want to thank you *very much* for the new "Writing R Extensions" manual
published with RW0.901 and hope this is the right place to report some
possible typos.


page 17, example given in the middle of the page, I think it should read

REAL(version) = 3.0;
          ^^^^^^^


page 23, second example, I think the parameter definition should read

SEXP lapply2(SEXP list, SEXP fn, SEXP rho)
                                              ^^

and the last line of the function I guess should be

VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
                                  ^^^^^^^^

If my understanding is wrong or you discover another typo in the lapply2
example, please give me a short note.

Regards

Subject: Bug list summary (automatic post)
Message-ID: <199912210615.HAA05627@biostat.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk or via email to
r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

It's not really new: it is a merge of the old Manual.tex and
R-external.texi that was distributed with 0.90.0. As 1.0 approaches we
are beginning to work hard on documentation.

The intention here was that the parameter be`expr' (it is an expression not
a function) and I have changed all uses of fn to expr. Unfortunately,
I tested it using `fn'.

Hi,
   As a precaution against all the computers here (Griffith University,
Australia) going down with the Y2K bug, all the computers are going down.
The site that the R archives are on will be down for a number of days over
the new year, and the machine which actually creates the HTML archive
files will be down for longer.

Apologies for the disruption.

Subject: BUG in format()? (PR#383)
Message-ID: <199912211639.RAA02470@pubhealth.ku.dk>



In RW0.651 and RW0.901,
I discovered some unexpected behaviour when I used as.matrix.data.frame()

> matrix('"', 2, 2)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,] "\"" "\""
[2,] "\"" "\""
> unclass(as.data.frame(matrix('"', 2, 2)))
$V1
[1] "\"" "\""

$V2
[1] "\"" "\""

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2"
> as.matrix(as.data.frame(matrix('"', 2, 2)))
  V1     V2
1 "\\\"" "\\\""
2 "\\\"" "\\\""


I traced it back to a call to format (probably .Internal(format, ...))

> format('"')
[1] "\\\""

> format('\\')
[1] "\\\\"

Same in format.char() but not in formatC()

This behaviour of format() is not intended, is it?
Regards


Jens

I think the problem was S-PLUS 5.0r[123]: 5.1's [ltr]apply seem fast again.

The key is to write a fast internal lapply and use that for the others.

No, but as the .Call introduction has a cut-down version, I might as
well take a look.

Actually, I misread: outer is quite slow but it does not use apply!

Now that is unexpected. The components should be factors. The code
converting matrices to data frames is not behaving as the prototype,
and that explains the rest, as the prototype gets the answer you would
expect. The rule is supposed to be that adding a matrix is equivalent to
adding each column in turn (White Book, page 59, and the S code).

I am not aware of any documentation of an R difference here (but I may be
wrong, although I checked the FAQ), and we need to fix either
as.data.frame.matrix or as.matrix.data.frame.  I will argue for the first.

I suspect it is.  What is going on here is that you are not expected to
feed the results of format to print, but to cat etc. formatC both formats
and prints.  Compare

> zz <- '"'
> zzz <- format(zz)
> print(zz)
[1] "\""
> print(zzz)
[1] "\\\""
> cat(zz, "\n")
" 
> cat(zzz, "\n")
\" 

The prototype does the same.  One can argue that the conventions
are sub-optimal, but that is what R-like languages do.

I would be happy to try a re-write of apply based around a fast lapply if
that was helpful.

Thank you for the bug report!

It also crashes on our Solaris platform, and with the newest "developers"
version.  
However, *only* when no device has been created previously in the current R
session, i.e., PREpending 

	par("usr") ; dev.off()

to your three commands gives the correct error message
  >>> Error in par(args) : parameter "tck" has the wrong length

Remark / Question :

 I think I would rather not have my students use low-level functions such
 as   plot.new()  and  plot.window()...

 Is there a reason they need these instead of  plot()/lines()/.... etc ?

Definitely.  The docs say that it (in fact, as.data.frame()) will do
type conversion, but it simply does not.

While fiddling with apply I noticed that there appears to be an error in
the dimnames, which actually show in the example.

     x <- cbind(x1 = 3, x2 = c(4:1, 2:5))
     dimnames(x)[[1]] <- letters[1:8]

First:

     apply(x, 2, sort)

I don't think the row names should not be retained here as they are not
common to all columns.

Second:

     cave <- function(x, c1,c2) c(mean(x[c1]),mean(x[c2]))
     apply(x,1, cave,  c1="x1", c2=c("x1","x2"))

I don't think the row names should be c("x1", "x2") which are left over
from the object x, but should be determined by the function cave, even to
the extent of not being present at all (the fact that cave returns a
vector of length 2 is just a coincidence).

I've attached a new apply (Apply) which takes care of these two problems,
at the cost of an extra lapply, anticipating an internal lapply shortly to
speed everything up.  Basically if FUN returns a vector and that vector
has common names across the columns (or, more generally, across MARGIN)
then these names are used to label the first extent; otherwise no names
are used.

Cheers, Jonathan.

Progress report!

1) This is nothing specific to aov. It can be repoduced by

response <- rnorm(60)
dag <- gl(3,2,60) 
model.matrix(formula = response ~ dag/response)

2) The crash occurs because a 60x3 (rather than 60x6) matrix is allocated,
so lots of writing outside the matrix occurs.

3) model.matrix(~ dag + response:dag) works, but has a slightly different
terms structure.

4) S generates a 60x5 matrix, which looks wrong to me.

Subject: BUG in format()? (PR#383)
Message-ID: <199912221332.OAA10020@pubhealth.ku.dk>



Dear Prof. Brian Ripley,

Thank you for your quick reply. It might be that we have two problems here.

(1) BUG in as.data.frame.matrix()
I must admit I was not aware that of the not-converting-to-factor
inconsistence here
(at the end of this mail more on this).

(2) BUG in as.matrix.data.frame()
My problem was that as.matrix.data.frame REALLY CHANGES THE DATA which
DEFINITTELY IS A BUG
It is totally legal to have a character column in a dataframe

> x <- as.data.frame(x=I(rep('"', 3)))

as expected it is
> unclass(x)
$x
[1] "\"" "\"" "\""
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2" "3"

here a first problem, well this is only printing
> x
     x
1 \\\"
2 \\\"
3 \\\"


but now look at this
correct:
> x[1,1]
[1] "\""

wrong:
> as.matrix(x)[1,1]
[1] "\\\""

this is not only a printing problem
correct:
> cat(x[1,1], "\n")
"

wrong:
> cat(as.matrix(x)[1,1], "\n")
\"

but DEFINITELY WRONG as can be seen in

> as.matrix(x)[1,1] == x[1,1]
[1] FALSE

It is caused, because as.matrix.data.frame makes use of format, and format
behaves as it does.
If, "that is what R-like languages do", then

(either) this convention about what format() does is not sub-optimal but
wrong
(or)     format MUST NEVER be used within R routines EXCEPT FOR PRINTING,
         i.e. formatting something and storing it or returning it from a
function is dangerous.
         Even the use for cat() may be dangerous, as cat() as a side effect
may store data,
         as in write() or write.table(). This deserves a BIG warning in the
documentation of format.

Here is a list of functions of package:base making use of format

> collect <- character()
> for (i in ls("package:base")){
+   if (   any(grep("format[(]", deparse(get(i, pos="package:base"))))
+       || any(grep("format.default[(]", deparse(get(i,
pos="package:base"))))
+      )collect <- c(collect, i)
+ }

To my understanding, at least as.matrix.data.frame() needs a fix.


Back to automatic conversion of characters to factors.

After fixing as.data.frame.matrix(), the following comparisions will be TRUE
or FALSE, depending whether mat is a numeric matrix or a character matrix:

  all( unclass(as.data.frame(mat)) == unclass(mat) )
  all( mat == sapply(as.data.frame(mat), FUN=function(x)x) )

Obviously automatic conversion to factors is a design decision long ago, but
I am not convinced yet, however.
The need to maintain attribute "AsIs" just to grant that a basic data type
(character) remains unchanged, appears to be somewhat dangerous. So both,
character data and factors need maintaining, in EACH FUNCTION that might
work on dataframes. Uff! It is easy to predict that errors will happen:

Some systematic testing ...

> char <- letters[1:2]
> fac <- factor(char)
> dd <- data.frame(char=I(char), fac=fac)

reveals that

> dd[,"char"] <- char
> dd[,"char"]
[1] a b
Levels:  a b

but
> dd$char <- char
> dd$char
[1] "a" "b"

So .Primitive("$<-") is inconsistent with automatically converting chars to
factors, as it allows to insert a pure character column into a dataframe,
which neither has attribute "AsIs" nor class "factor".

Handling I() is risky as well:

> mat <- matrix(letters, 2, 2)
> dimnames(mat) <- list(c(1:2), c("x","y"))
> mat
  x   y
1 "a" "c"
2 "b" "d"

> dd <- data.frame(I(mat))
> ddd
  I.mat..x I.mat..y
1        a        a
2        b        b
3        c        c

doesn't look too bad,
but
> dimnames(dd)
[[1]]
[1] "1" "2"

[[2]]
[1] "I.mat."

> str(ddd)
`data.frame':     3 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ I.mat.: chr [1:3, 1:2] "a" "b" "c" "a" "b" "c"
  ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  .. ..$ : NULL
  .. ..$ : chr  "x" "y"
  ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "AsIs"
>

So this dataframe is no longer a simple list with each element representing
one column, and thus

> sapply(ddd, FUN=function(x)x)
     I.mat.
[1,] "a"
[2,] "b"
[3,] "c"
[4,] "a"
[5,] "b"
[6,] "c"

is no longer a matrix.

Back to "AsIs":

> ddd[,1]
     x   y
[1,] "a" "a"
[2,] "b" "b"
[3,] "c" "c"
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

So here the whole matrix is "AsIs", and since matrix subscribting probably
doesn't  maintain "AsIs"
> ddd[[1]][, 1]
[1] "a" "b" "c"

"AsIs" is gone.

I think we have established that format probably works as intended, and
that there is a bug in as.matrix.data.frame that I have just corrected.

Personally, I suspect that is you want to use " and \ in character strings
it is too much to expect consistent handling over all conversions.
That S has similar inconsistencies and yet I have never heard a complaint
suggests that it is a very rare requirement.

Right, nailed it.  The problem is the do_modelmatrix attempts to remove the
response if it occurs on the rhs by declaring it to generate zero columns.
Thus all interactions including the response were declared to have zero
columns too, but they were being generated.

As far as I can see the prototype drops the response if it occurs on its
own as a main effect, but keeps in all interactions.  I've altered
R's code to do the same. The results are not the same in this example
as they interpret the interaction differently: I think R's is probably
right, but as this is not a real example the important thing is to
self-consistent.

Subject: as.matrix.data.frame() modifies content of character columns (PR#386)
Message-ID: <199912221523.QAA12780@pubhealth.ku.dk>



If you have the following dataframe:

> x <- data.frame(x=I(rep('"', 3)))

then

> as.matrix(x)[1,1] == x[1,1]
[1] FALSE

which seems to be WRONG to me.

Also I don't understand
> x
     x
1 \\\"
2 \\\"
3 \\\"


Details
=======

As expected
> unclass(x)
$x
[1] "\"" "\"" "\""
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

attr(,"row.names")
[1] "1" "2" "3"


but now look at this
correct:
> x[1,1]
[1] "\""

wrong:
> as.matrix(x)[1,1]
[1] "\\\""

this is not only a printing problem
correct:
> cat(x[1,1], "\n")
"

wrong:
> cat(as.matrix(x)[1,1], "\n")
\"


Interpretation
==============

To my understanding, this is caused, because as.matrix.data.frame makes use
of format, and format does

> cat(format('"'), "\n")
\"

If this is the cause and format() does right, then consequently

         format MUST NEVER be used within R routines EXCEPT FOR PRINTING,
         i.e. formatting something and storing it or returning it from a
function is dangerous.
         Even the use for cat() may be dangerous, as cat() as a side effect
may store data,
         as in write() or write.table(). This deserves a BIG warning in the
documentation of format.

Here is a list of functions of package:base making use of format

> collect <- character()
> for (i in ls("package:base")){
+   if (   any(grep("format[(]", deparse(get(i, pos="package:base"))))

pos="package:base"))))

Simply drop it, without any replacement/improvement on its way?

Not that I would need it, but we certainly lack functionality in
experimental design ...

I'm copying this to R-devel because I think the warning messages might
be improved a bit (and I'm not sure what the problem is but there may
also be a bug). I think the install.packages() and update.packages()
mechanism is very exciting. It speeds and simplifies updates, which is
very important when things are changing as rapidly as they are now
changing, but it still has a few rough edges.

First of all, you might try install.packages(c("tseries", "VR")) or some
other packages directly from CRAN to see if you get a similar error.
Installing from my server by setting contriburl is still somewhat
experimental (and perhaps unorthodox).  Syskern and tframe are standard
packages, but dse is a bundle of two packages together. This is
something new in R 0.90.1 which I don't think was supported in 0.90.0.

Also, I think install.packages is only supported in Unix so far, and it
depends on another utility which you may have to install. My Linux
distribution had wget installed, but I had to install it on my Solaris
system. (I got it from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu.) There can be
additional problems with firewalls and proxy servers. If you do not want
to install this way yet, you can download the three tar.gz files from by
web site and install them in the standard way, but I think you will be
impressed with install.packages() when it works.

Install.packages uses download.file() which by default tries to
determine if you have cp, wget, or lynx for getting a file from a server
on the Internet. The message "sh: wget: command not found" suggests you
do not have wget and, if I understand things correctly, download.files
has already not found cp and will next try lynx. If it does not find
lynx it returns the message "No download method found", and since you
did not get that message I think lynx must have been found. I get the
"argument 'lib' is missing ..." warning, but it does not seem to be a
problem. It may be a problem if you do not have write permission in the
directory where R is installed.

I can't tell what program cannot find the object x. If you can generate
the error again and then do traceback() it would be helpful. I tried to
generate the error this morning running Linux from home, and have
generated some other problems you may watch out for, but not that one.
On the first attempted my Internet connection stalled on dse, but the
first two packages installed ok. On my second attempt everything worked
ok, except I was running on a machine which did not have a fortran
compiler. The warning about this was very hard to see with all the other
output that is generated. (R-devel: I think --quiet to wget would be a
better default and it would be nice if the output from R INSTALL could
be surpressed except for error and warning messages. Possibly this can
be accomplished simply by redirecting the output to a scatch file and
grepping for warnings and errors.) On the third attempt, as with my
attempts yesterday, everything worked ok.

I will be out of the office for the next two weeks. I'm sorry to leave
you without better suggestions about the problem. If there are not other
suggestions from R-devel you may want to try the more traditional
install (downloading the files gunzip and un-tar, then R INSTALL ...)

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Right.

Also fully supported on Windows, but you need wget.exe (which we put on
CRAN) or lynx.exe.

It is a warning. You are supposed to specify where you want the files
put (in which local library).   If you do not, it will pick the first in 
the list (.lib.loc) and tell you what it has done, in case it surprises
you. As Paul G says. you may need to specify an alternative. (The help
file does point out that you will get a warning: it always helps to read
the help, if only so you can tell us it is not good enough!)

I just sent a message to the r-help list with some advice on using
install.packages.  I said

 Note that as of version 0.90.1 you can get the MASS, nnet, spatial,
 and class libraries in a single bundle with
  install.packages("VR")   # packages from the Venables and Ripley bundle
 You do need to set the CRAN option to a legitimate CRAN archive site,
 have access to the Internet, and have either the wget or lynx programs
 on your search path.

 The default for options("CRAN") is cran.r-project.org.  You may want
 to use cran.dk.r-project.org, the Danish mirror, instead.

(The message was to a Danish user of R.  Other CRAN mirror locations
are listed at http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

To use this system you must have either wget or lynx installed so the
package file can be automatically downloaded via http.  (If people
know of other programs that will do a batch download of a file via
http, please tell us.)  You should ensure that options("CRAN") is set
to a nearby CRAN archive.  Because I am in the United States my
~/.Rprofile file contains
 ### $Id:$
 ### .Rprofile for Douglas Bates

 options(CRAN="http://cran.us.r-project.org/")

All of this applies to the Unix/Linux versions of R.  As I understand
it, the Windows version can use install.packages() but only after you
have manually transferred the .zip file for the package to the local
filesystem.  At that point you could use the rwinst.exe installer
instead.  Brian Ripley or Guido Masarotto may want to give the
definitive word on what can be done in the Windows version.

Subject: different subscripting behaviour using  $<-  or  [<-  for data.frames (PR#387)
Message-ID: <199912231815.TAA21687@pubhealth.ku.dk>



I observe if

then

> dd[,"char"] <- char
> dd[,"char"]
[1] a b
Levels:  a b

and

> dd$char <- char
> dd$char
[1] "a" "b"

are different.

After the latter operation the data.frame contains a character column, which
neither has attribute "AsIs" nor has been converted to class factor. Is this
intended?

Subject: data.frame(I(matrix)) ? (PR#388)
Message-ID: <199912231817.TAA21718@pubhealth.ku.dk>



I observe dificulties with using data.frame(I(matrix))

2        b        b
3        c        c

doesn't look too bad,
but,
has only one column name:

> dimnames(dd)
[[1]]
[1] "1" "2"

[[2]]
[1] "I.mat."

and unexpected structure

`data.frame':     3 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ I.mat.: chr [1:3, 1:2] "a" "b" "c" "a" "b" "c"
  ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  .. ..$ : NULL
  .. ..$ : chr  "x" "y"

[2,] "b" "b"
[3,] "c" "c"
attr(,"class")
[1] "AsIs"

This dataframe is not a simple list with each element representing one
column.

Consequently, e.g.

     I.mat.
[1,] "a"
[2,] "b"
[3,] "c"

This is the Right Thing:  we use the fact that multicolumn things can be a
single column of a data frame in logistic regression and extensively in
the survival analysis functions (and probably other places).  However, it
does make it hard to turn a character matrix into a data frame.  Perhaps
there should be an option of some sort?

  I will try to add something of this sort during next XMax holidays.
  Kurt, I am pretty sure that I will need your help for this and also for 
  the base distribution since I want to try to port the 
  png, jpeg and bmp devices now working under Windows (and
  so I need some compiler switch to know if libpng, jpeg...
  are installed). More after the attempt.

Works fine here... 

Which flavour of linux is doing that to you? Did you install from
prepackaged binaries or compile R yourself? (I've had one report
saying that demo(graphics) crashed in RH6.0 when installing from .rpm)

Could you please try debugging a little further?

Try /path/to/R -d gdb, run, recreate the crash, and tell us what gdb
says at that that point and the first couple of line of "bt" output
might also be useful.

I've added a line in rbind.data.frame() which removes all length 0
arguments.  This solves the problems you describe and passes make check,
but I am not sure if we really want it ...

I think I agree that we don't want it!

Well, my computer is not connected to my alarm clock (yet...). Bad
habit, but it's so nice and quiet at that time and I had some stuff I

"bt" (backtrace) is just a gdb command which you type at the (gdb)
prompt, but never mind. The output below suffices in this case (but if
it were inside a utility routine called from multiple places, I would
have wanted to know where it was called from).

Obviously, this shouldn't crash R, but the only reason I can see that
it might happen is if the scalable fonts are absent *and* the Adobe
fonts are not present in both 75dpi and 100dpi versions. I seem to
recall that RH6.0 had a bug in the font server setup somewhat to that
effect (causing Netscape to crash all over the place). So what is in
your /etc/X11/fs/config ? Mine (RH6.1+modif.) has:

catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,

If you plot a vector of numbers which are all very similar
(i.e. within the range of some eps), the y-axis is not drawn
correctly. Either it is completely missing and there is an additional
horizontal line (1st example below) or it is longer than the plotting
region (2nd example).

Nice to know that you got it working, but it still puzzles me that it
broke. Unless, perhaps, you happen not to have the 100dpi fonts
installed...

(BTW: Things look much nicer with the urw fonts in RH6.1...)

This one works for me on Solaris and Linux (though with Linux the label

On Solaris (with a somewhat old version of R) this causes an infinite loop
(interruptable by C-c) in pretty0

Apparently that one doesn't get trapped by the no-segfault checks.
Martin? 

(It's not too high priority to fix, but confusing data.entry and
dataentry provokes this quite easily.)

Subject: dataframes in glm (PR#392)
Message-ID: <199912291322.OAA04095@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the glm documentation, an optional dataframe can be
supplied in data=. It would be nice if any object that can be coerced
to a dataframe (as.data.frame) were accepted. I am thinking of my data
objects. As it stands, I have to use data=as.data.frame(object) in
glm.
  As far as I can see, the only change required is to add a line in
models.R. After l.216:

if(missing(data))
	data <- sys.frame(sys.parent())

add

else if(!is.data.frame(data)&&!is.environment(data))
	data <- as.data.frame(data)

I don't think this should have adverse effects elsewhere and would
make life easier for the users of my libraries.
  Thanks. Jim

Subject: network outage for omegahat.org, r-project.org, and madisonlinux.org
Message-ID: <6r7lhwdu9g.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

As described below, external network connections to the campus of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison will be either inaccessible or slow
from 20:00 CST 2000/01/03 until 01:00 CST 2000/01/04.  CST is our
local time zone: Central Standard Time in North America.  These local
times correspond to 04:00 - 07:00 GMT Tuesday 2000/01/04.

This planned outage will affect the r-project.org, omegahat.org, and
madisonlinux.org domains because the name servers for those domains
and some of the primary http servers for those domains are here.

Those of us on this campus hope to be so occupied with celebrating a
victory by the Wisconsin Badgers football team in the Rose Bowl game
(to be played on January 1) that we won't notice this outage. :-)

DoIT Network Engineering will be changing the UW's autonomous system

disabling all off-campus connectivity.  Internal network traffic will
not be affected.  Off-campus connectivity will be re-established in
stages, so throughput to some sites may appear slow at first, and should
increase with time.  Full throughput should be re-established by 1am.

Before others point out my inability to convert from a 12 hour clock

not 20:00.

There's a not-so-short  "stop.list" of functions which are *NOT* tested for
segfaults.   dataentry (w/ and w/o ".") is among them.
all the interactive ones are, actually.
[[remember:   The list was quite a bit shorter, and there were R core
	      members who complained...]] 

Look in  ..../tests/make-no-segfault.R for the statements starting with

 edit.int <- c("fix", "edit", "vi", "emacs", "pico", "xemacs", "xedit")
 misc.int <- c("browser", "bug.report", "menu")
 stop.list[["base"]] <-
    ..

to find all the functions which are *not* tested for seg.faults.

Maybe we (R-core) we should really always have
      R_TESTLOTS=yes
in our environments?
