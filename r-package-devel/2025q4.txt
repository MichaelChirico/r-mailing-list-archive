See Section 1.6 "Writing Portable Packages" of _Writing R Extensions_ under
the bullet point for `make`:

   ? If your package has a ?Makevars? or ?Makefile? file, make sure that
     you use only portable make features.  Such files should be
     LF-terminated(2) (including the final line of the file) and not
     make use of GNU extensions.  (The POSIX specification is available
     at
     <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html>;
     anything not documented there should be regarded as an extension to
     be avoided.  Further advice can be found at
     <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Portable-Make>.
     )  Commonly misused GNU extensions are conditional inclusions
     (?ifeq? and the like), ?${shell ...}?, ?${wildcard ...}? and
     similar, and the use of ?+=?(3) and ?:=?.  Also, the use of ?$<?
     other than in implicit rules is a GNU extension, as is the ?$^?
     macro.  As is the use of ?.PHONY? (some other makes ignore it).
     Unfortunately makefiles which use GNU extensions often run on other
     platforms but do not have the intended results.

     Note that the ?-C? flag for ?make? is not included in the POSIX
     specification and is not implemented by some of the ?make?s which
     have been used with R. However, it is more commonly implemented
     (e.g. by FreeBSD ?make?) than the GNU-specific ?--directory=?.

     You should not rely on built-in/default ?make? rules, even when
     specified by POSIX, as some ?make?s do not have the POSIX ones and
     others have altered them.

     The use of ?${shell ...}? can be avoided by using backticks, e.g.

          PKG_CPPFLAGS = `gsl-config --cflags`

     which works in all versions of ?make? known(4) to be used with R.

     If you really must require GNU make, declare it in the
     ?DESCRIPTION? file by

          SystemRequirements: GNU make

     and ensure that you use the value of environment variable ?MAKE?
     (and not just ?make?) in your scripts.  (On some platforms GNU make
     is available under a name such as ?gmake?, and there
     ?SystemRequirements? is used to set ?MAKE?.)  Your ?configure?
     script (or similar) does need to check that the executable pointed
     to by ?MAKE? is indeed GNU make.

     If you only need GNU make for parts of the package which are rarely
     needed (for example to create bibliography files under
     ?vignettes?), use a file called ?GNUmakefile? rather than
     ?Makefile? as GNU make (only) will use the former.

     macOS has used GNU make for many years (it previously used BSD
     make), but the version has been frozen at 3.81 (from 2006).

     Since the only viable make for Windows is GNU make, it is
     permissible to use GNU extensions in files ?Makevars.win?,
     ?Makevars.ucrt?, ?Makefile.win? or ?Makefile.ucrt?.

You either comply, or you declare 'SystemRequirements: GNU make' as many
packages do. There is no gradient here.

Hope this helps, Dirk

I would recommend investing some time in a (possibly Docker-based) setup that
closely matches the system where this failed so see if you can replicate it
so that you can try to find ways to avoid it.

For what it is worth, I did a quick-ish test in a r2u-based container (based
on Ubuntu 24.04), installed your dependencies (as binaries apart from
GeneralizedUmatrix) as well as this package. It passes its regression tests
and did not segfault.

That does not prove correctness. The next step is then often to try tools
like valgrind or ASAN/SAN, also in containers, to get other hints.  I have
been this for a number years (decades actually) and often thought "well CRAN
must be wrong here". They never were. The tests are there for a reason, even
if it pains us.

(I would also think about changing the language on your webpage. Referring to
two packages as CRAN packages when they are not does not help casual users.)

Cheers, Dirk

Just from these two lines, one can't tell what was the problem. It would 
be slightly better to see complete outputs of the failed checks, that 
could give a hint where it failed.

To provoke the crash on a system where it normally doesn't happen, one 
might try using gc torture (see ?gctorture). Also one might try running 
with address sanitizer/valgrind to see if those tools could find a 
memory error. Possibly one could run only a smaller part of the check, 
based on the output - e.g. if it crashes while running a specific 
example, one might try just running that example in isolation (with 
gctorture, valgrind, etc).

Certainly that it crashes on some platforms means there is an error (in 
the package, or depenendent packages, or possibly used libraries or R).

Hi Everyone,

One of the functions in my DiNAMIC.Duo package on CRAN uses the biomaRt package to download gene position information from the Ensembl website.  Currently I use one of the Ensembl archives (ensemblHost=http://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org in the code below).  The archive is unavailable periodically, so the function includes the following code in an effort to ??fail gracefully,?? as is required by CRAN:

statusCode = curl::curl_fetch_memory(ensemblHost)$status_code
if (statusCode != 200)
{
stop(paste(ensemblHost, "currently not available"))
}

I recently received a notice from CRAN stating that that an error was received when checking examples with ?Vrun-donttest.  Specifically, the following:

Error in `req_perform()`:
! Failed to perform HTTP request.
Caused by error in `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`:

Hi everyone,

I submitted an update for my broadcast R-package yesterday on CRAN.
Prior to submission I checked the package with R CMD check, devtools::check_win_devel(), with devtools::check_mac_release(), and with various operating systems via GitHub actions.
No problems were found.

But I see on the CRAN page that the new version of broadcast fails to install on r-devel fedora clang.
The install log can be found here: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00install.html

It's unclear to me why exactly installation fails. The only concrete statement I can find in the install log is "CPU time limit exceeded". Does this mean the installation simply took too long? If it is something else, what then happened exactly? And how can I fix it?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Tony

Message-ID: <188A464A-2FCF-4FF5-B7D0-D39A9D7B64EE@unibe.ch>

Dear list members,

We are trying to get our package rsofun updated on CRAN. The source code is hosted in the master branch at: https://github.com/geco-bern/rsofun

The CRAN pretest fails on Debian with the NOTE: ?Installation took CPU time 2.8 times elapsed time?. For full output see: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rsofun_5.1.0_20251001_152239/

From what I gathered, the discrepancy between walltime and elapsed time hints at use of more than two cores. Note that contrary to issues I found online, here it appears to be linked to installation of the package and not the test suite, examples, or vignettes. Test suite, examples, and vignettes report equal walltime and elapsed time.

The cookbook (https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/code_issues.html) suggests use of the j-flag for compilation (which I am unsure how to implement). Whereas LLMs suggest to ensure all dependencies are stated in ?src/Makevars? (which I tried to ensure). However still no success with the current version of the code.

I would appreciate any suggestions how to resolve this.
Best regards!

I cannot replicate this in a container running r2u (to get all your nunerous
dependencies quickly as binaries) running Ubuntu 24.04:

  [...]
  * checking whether package ?rsofun? can be installed ... OK
  * used C compiler: ?gcc (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0?
  * used Fortran compiler: ?GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0?
  * checking installed package size ... OK  
  [...]

so you could try to ask this if this may have to do with their use of clang
and flang-new. That said, I somehow doubt that is the case as it would hit
every package with Fortran sources.

>From a first glance your src/Makevars is correct (and elaborate). You do not
ask for any parallel compilation (which is what this check is about -- as
CRAN runs many builds and checks in parallel in their server they have to
ensure no one build 'runs away' with resources).

Yet if you look at the 00install.out in that URL reference you see that your
compilations _happens twice_ once before and and once after the linking of
rsofun.so. I cannot say if that causes it, but I would try to rework that:
there should be no need to compile the Fortran files and wrappersc.c twice.

This may be a compiler error in that (new-ish) version of clang.

A good first step would be to see if another build of clang-21 succeeds,
ideally on a similar Fedora system, else on whatever other system you can
deploy clang-21. There have been prior discussions of this here, as I recall
clang you can nightlies from clang for Debian; I do not know if they offer
that for Fedora. See https://apt.llvm.org/

[ Some time later ]

Ok, I just installed your package onto a rocker/r-base container (running
Debian testing/unstable) with both clang-21 and clang-22 in turn. [1] So you
could try to email CRAN suggestion their particular build of clang-21 may
have an issue. You may want to replicate what I did here with the exact
compiler flags they used to be sure. It would also help to get clang-21 on
Fedora but I am not sure it is pre-made somewhere and building it from source
is of course more work.

Hope this helps,  Dirk

[1 ] I had to muck a little longer than I should have to get the apt repo
setup -- the website lists the old 'list' format of apt files, we now need / prefer
the newer 'sources' format with a key. I will try to write that up as I am
sure I will need it again.

Thank you for consulting the cookbook! If all you have is Makevars,
there should be no need for setting the -j flag anywhere; that advice
is there for the CMake+Ninja and Rust build systems, which default to
using all available cores.

This is good advice (you need the dependencies in case someone does run
MAKEFLAGS=-j$(nproc) R CMD INSTALL rsofun_*.tar.gz), but it won't help
you with unintended installation-time parallelism. Your current
Makevars, as noted by Dirk, has mistakes in the stated dependencies:

>> all: $(SHLIB) clean

This is wrong because it implies that 'make clean' could be started at
the same time while $(SHLIB) is being built, removing the object files
that $(SHLIB) actually depends upon.

Removing the 'all: clean' dependency (but keeping 'all: $(SHLIB)' as the
first target), removing the additional dependencies of $(SHLIB), and
using the output of the following Perl program for all dependency
information helps your package survive installation with MAKEFLAGS=-j2:

perl -lne '
	my $o = $ARGV =~ s/[.]f90$/.o/r;
	$modules{$1} = $o
		if /^\s*module\s+(\w+)/;
	push @{$uses{$o}}, $1
		if /^\s*use\s*(\w+)/;
}{
	while (my ($k, $v) = each %modules) {
		print "$k.mod: $v";
	}
	while (my ($k, $v) = each %uses) {
		print "$k: ", join " ", map "$_.mod", @$v;
	}
' *.f90

While the build system trying to be too helpful is a common case of
this NOTE (in which case the solution is easy), it is not the only
possible explanation. We've also seen GCC internally spawn too many
child processes for link-time optimisation (system setup problem, not a
package problem, since fixed) and a package accidentally spawning too
many OpenMP threads in .onLoad for a short while, affecting some of its
reverse dependencies (also fixed).

Let's try to see which parts of R CMD INSTALL create child threads.
It's not the only way extra CPU time could be spent (and not the only
way threads could be created), but you have to start somewhere.

wget https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/rsofun_5.1.0.tar.gz
ltrace -w 10 -f -e pthread_create -- \
 sh -c 'R CMD INSTALL -l rsofun.Rcheck rsofun_5.1.0.tar.gz'

Does the package or its dependencies do something strange while
preparing the namespace? No, 'cli' only starts a single thread and
that's it. Does the compiler start extra threads? Why yes, it does:

flang-new-19  -fpic  -g  -c  main_pmodel.mod.f90 -o main_pmodel.mod.o
[pid 13542] --- Called exec() ---

On my 16-thread machine this varies per file (up to 16 threads in the
pool for the largest file) and results in an average load of 18s user /
15s real = 1.2. It's not implausible that the older 2x Xeon E5-2690
running the incoming pretests at CRAN (with 32 threads in total) end up
at 280% average CPU load due to flang-new-19's multi-threading.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any way to disable LLVM multi-threading
at runtime, short of recompiling LLVM.

Tony,

The script below should set you up for clang-22 on the rocker/r-base
container running Debian testing/unstable, and ensure R uses clang-22.

The fact that clang-22 passes the build whereas as the clang-21 version at
CRAN encounters an error may be indicative on an issue in that clang-21, but
it is hard to tell for sure.

For another test I ensured I also used -O3 and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 (switching
from the Debian defaults of 2). There are a number of other flags that
differ, and they may matter.  It still appears to build (if slowly, seems
like there is a fair bit of complex C++ in there). [ Minutes later ] It seems
to hang at compilation of rcpp_bc_b.cpp.  So the higher optimization level on
the Fedora machine at CRAN may have something to do with this -- using -O2
and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 worked here.  You could ask for re-check given that
clang 21 and 22 apparently build your package in the Debian container I used,
at least with the lower default values used by the Debian setup.

Hi everyone,

Sorry, false alarm.
There's probably no problem on the side of CRAN.
The problem was probably on my side.

My code is not wrong per-s?, but I created an additional if()else() statement in rcpp_bc_b, but left the MACRO - which itself has many if-else statements - the same. And each of those "if" leads to a whole set of for-loops, thus causing the compiled code to become much larger than necessary. And the compiler for fedora clang took too long to compile that script as a consequence, creating an installation fail.

I've already send a fixed version, broadcast 0.1.5.1, to CRAN, that should fix this issue.

Kind regards,

Tony

Onderwerp: new package version fails on r-devel fedora clang

Hi everyone,

I submitted an update for my broadcast R-package yesterday on CRAN.
Prior to submission I checked the package with R CMD check, devtools::check_win_devel(), with devtools::check_mac_release(), and with various operating systems via GitHub actions.
No problems were found.

But I see on the CRAN page that the new version of broadcast fails to install on r-devel fedora clang.
The install log can be found here: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00install.html

It's unclear to me why exactly installation fails. The only concrete statement I can find in the install log is "CPU time limit exceeded". Does this mean the installation simply took too long? If it is something else, what then happened exactly? And how can I fix it?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Tony

Dear all

In recent days, I also experienced that I did not receive an email with a
link to the check results from winbuilder after uploading an improved
version of my micEcon package. On Friday morning (CEST), I uploaded the
package twice to both R-release and R-devel but I didn't receive any email.
Yesterday (Saturday) afternoon/evening I tried again and received an email
with the results of the check with R-release but not with R-devel. As there
was a warning, I uploaded a further improved package to both R-release and
R-devel last night. Although I did this twice, I didn't receive any email.
I checked my GMail spam folder but the emails aren't there either.  In
total, 5 times uploaded to R-release but only 1 email with results and 5
times uploaded to R-devel but no response at all. I have regularly used
winbuilder for many years but never experienced this problem before. Please
check this. Thanks a lot!

Best wishes,
Arne

Hi Vonn,

You could wrap the offending example in try et.al. and handle failed situations in a way that gives a warning but not an error.

Best,
Berry

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package cannot connect to Ensembl

Hi Everyone,

One of the functions in my DiNAMIC.Duo package on CRAN uses the biomaRt package to download gene position information from the Ensembl website.  Currently I use one of the Ensembl archives (ensemblHost=http://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org in the code below).  The archive is unavailable periodically, so the function includes the following code in an effort to ??fail gracefully,?? as is required by CRAN:

statusCode = curl::curl_fetch_memory(ensemblHost)$status_code
if (statusCode != 200)
{
stop(paste(ensemblHost, "currently not available"))
}

I recently received a notice from CRAN stating that that an error was received when checking examples with ?Vrun-donttest.  Specifically, the following:

Error in `req_perform()`:
! Failed to perform HTTP request.
Caused by error in `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`:
! SSL connect error [aug2020.archive.ensembl.org]:

Any suggestions on how to revise the existing code would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your reply.

Hello everyone,

I have fixed the 'broadcast' package (updated to version 0.1.5.1), but there is still an installation error on r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00check.html.
Either there is still an issue with broadcast, or there is actually an issue with the compiler CRAN uses for fedora.
If there is still an issue with broadcast: What exactly is the issue? The install.log is not clear to me.
If there is an issue on the side of CRAN: May I respectfully request CRAN to double-check their clang compiler and re-run the checks for broadcast 0.1.5.1?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Tony

Hi Dirk and CRAN,


@Dirk: thanks so much for the trouble!

I actually think I know what went wrong. My code is not wrong per-s?.
I created an addition if()else() statement in rcpp_bc_b, but left the MACRO - which itself has many if-else statements - the same. And each of those "if" leads to a whole set of for-loops, thus causing the compiled code to become much larger than necessary.

It's very easy to fix.
But it does feel like a rookie mistake; sorry for the trouble!

@CRAN: Sorry! I was wrong, and your system is probably correct. If it's OK with you, I'll send an updated version of 'broadcast' tonight. That should fix the error in the Fedora clang checks.

Kind regards,

Tony

Yes, it works again :-) Thanks a lot, Uwe, for fixing this! ...and
thanks a lot to you and the entire CRAN team for your fantastic work!

The error log at
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00install.html
makes it pretty clear that there's a bug in the compiler being used on
that CRAN machine, but that might still not absolve you of the
responsibility of working around the issue.

At least, this line:

5. Running pass "jump-threading" on function
"_Z16rcpp_bcRel_dec_dP7SEXPRECS0_S0_S0_S0_S0_S0_lid"

indicates that the bug is happening while compiling the
'cpp_bcRel_dec_d' function.

Is there another way of expressing the computation you're doing in
that function that might avoid hitting this issue? From a brief scan
of the code, it's hard to give concrete advice because of the heavy
use of macros within that code.

Best,
Kevin

Hi Kevin, CRAN, and the rest,

Thank you for your answer, Kevin, I appreciate it!

If there is an issue in the compiler CRAN uses, it seems reasonable that CRAN fixes that.
I also don't know how to work around a bug in a compiler. How would you even do that?

Literally the only concrete thing Brian Ripley said to me was "Taking 5h CPU time to (fail to) install is unreasonable -- resubmitting without addressing the problem more so." Ignoring the fact that I did indeed try to address the problem, the only think I can do (and have been doing), is trying to reduce the compiled size of the C/C++ code, to reduce installation time.

But if there is a bug in CRAN's compiler, re-submitting will probably just end up getting another fail, regardless of how small the package becomes. That would be a waste of CRAN's time and resources. I appreciate CRAN, and so I don't like wasting their time and resources.

@BrianRipley/@CRAN: I'm very willing to submit a package with a significantly smaller compiled size (and thus hopefully faster installation). But I ask again: please be so kind to at least check your clang compiler. Asking me to fix a problem caused by CRAN's own compiler seems unreasonable. If you say the compiler is good or has been fixed, I'll re-submit my package with the reduced size & installation time. Does that sound fair?

Thanks in advance for your response!

Kind regards,

Tony

In an ideal world, sure. But please keep in mind that CRAN's resources are
somewhat limited. There are over a thousand of us package maintainers, and
only about four (core) CRAN maintainers looking after the key machines, and a
few CRAN helpers aiding with various tasks.

| I also don't know how to work around a bug in a compiler. How would you even do that?

Maybe rearrange / rewrite your code?  As I mentioned to you (following up
off-list to initial on-list email) when both option values are increased from
level two (which I see used by default on Debian for both -O2 and for
-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2; Ubuntu seems to use -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 with -O2) to
level three the compilation of file rcpp_bc_b.cpp takes a really long time
but passes. On Fedora at CRAN it fails, and we do not know if that is an
genuine error or a resource limit.

My first instinct would be to make this file smaller but replacing it with
two, three, ... smaller files that tax the compiler less.
 
| Literally the only concrete thing Brian Ripley said to me was "Taking 5h CPU time to (fail to) install is unreasonable -- resubmitting without addressing the problem more so." Ignoring the fact that I did indeed try to address the problem, the only think I can do (and have been doing), is trying to reduce the compiled size of the C/C++ code, to reduce installation time.
| 
| But if there is a bug in CRAN's compiler, re-submitting will probably just end up getting another fail, regardless of how small the package becomes. That would be a waste of CRAN's time and resources. I appreciate CRAN, and so I don't like wasting their time and resources.

It is still an 'if'. We suggested to you that you need to reproduce it.

I read the (private, I assume) reply by Brian Ripley as indicating that a
resource watcher on his machine killed the compilation. The compilation could
also have been killed. I do not know. I know that I built your package with
the same clang version (as mentioned in my emails) on a different distro (so
under slightly different values).

| @BrianRipley/@CRAN: I'm very willing to submit a package with a significantly smaller compiled size (and thus hopefully faster installation). But I ask again: please be so kind to at least check your clang compiler. Asking me to fix a problem caused by CRAN's own compiler seems unreasonable. If you say the compiler is good or has been fixed, I'll re-submit my package with the reduced size & installation time. Does that sound fair?

If possible, please try to reproduce and then address the issue in a similar
setting. I recommend Docker with a Fedora image, with luck the newest Fedora
Core may have clang21 you can use. Else use Debian as I showed you. Recognize
compilation limits in time and memory and aim to reduce them.  CRAN runs many
builds in parallel, when I noted to you that it took a long time locally I
was doing this on a recent-ish and reasonably able machine with lots of
memory free for that build.

Hope this helps, and that you get your package adjusted.

Cheers, Dirk

For example, the SQLite developers have to do that every now and then:
https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/f0f921bb80b50959d50f5f560d42fef940ba9a78aa254703bb04cd680b261f11

If the bug is reported to the compiler developers, sometimes it's
fixed, but that may take months (or years...), and the already released
versions of the compiler that still have the bug stay in use for much
longer: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/70828

Clang is programmed to print a message saying "PLEASE submit a bug
report" when it receives an unexpected fatal signal. Here, the fatal
signal is SIGXCPU, delivered by the kernel because of the 90-minute
per-process CPU time limit set for the job [0]. This is not a crash,
you can see this for yourself using something like

( ulimit -S -t 2; R -q -s -e 'repeat runif(100)' )

The bits of information we have are Ttotal=19394.68s [1], the R CMD
check output [2] saying that R CMD INSTALL tool 94 minutes of real time
but 323 minutes of userspace plus kernel CPU time, and 00install.log
saying that the processes being stopped for going over the limit are
compiling rcpp_bcRel_dec.cpp and rcpp_bc_int.cpp.

Using compilers from [3], it's possible to reproduce something similar
to but not as drastic as the problem visible on CRAN:

/usr/bin/time \

450924maxresident)k
0inputs+1888outputs (0major+74883426minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Why does it take more than 90 minutes of CPU time on the Fedora
machine running CRAN checks but only ~11 minutes on my lab workstation?
This probably has to do with 7 years of difference between the CPUs
running the code: Prof. Brian D. Ripley uses a server-oriented Intel
Xeon E5-2440 from ~2012, while mine is a desktop-oriented Ryzen from
2019.

Preprocessing the *.cpp files from your package and passing them
through clang-format, I see a lot of declarations and some inline
functions from Rcpp, but the code from files rcpp_bc_b.cpp,
rcpp_bc_int.cpp, and rcpp_bcRel_dec.cpp expands to tens of thousands of
lines on top of that, with some blocks nested ~28 times. Perhaps you
could join the #llvm channel at irc.oftc.net and ask for
recommendations regarding this kind of code? You may have a genuine
performance bug report on your hands.

With the deadline looming, are there any workarounds that would stop
the acute symptoms without spending the time treating the underlying
condition? It might help to put each macro-heavy function into a
separate *.cpp file, but I haven't tested that suggestion.

Most excellent work. I suspected this, but was not careful enough: I looked
for SIGKILL so 'today I learned' about SIGXCPU.

My recommendation ended up being the same though: those files should to be
smaller / simpler.

Should we ask the LLVM team if they think it's worth handling the
SIGXCPU signal in an alternate way? Since the message they're printing
here implies it's a bug in the compiler... or at least, they could
print the signal number / signal name in the message log produced.
Unless I missed something?

In any case, I agree with the other suggestions re: splitting those
functions out into separate files.

Another thing worth trying would be to try porting some of these
functions from C++ to C -- as far as I can see, you aren't making use
of (any?) C++-specific features, beyond the automatic generation of
interfaces offered by Rcpp. You could even keep the C++ interfaces
auto-generated by Rcpp, but have those call back to separate C
functions each defined in separate files, just to keep life simple.

Best,
Kevin

Hi everyone,

I followed the given advise to the best of my abilities: rewritten some c++ scripts to c, split large c++ scripts into smaller pieces, simplified the macros, reduced the install size & time of the package, and checked the package against fedora clang using rhub (unfortunately they didnt have clang21, but I checked what I could).
I re-submitted the new version pf package, version 0.1.5.2, to cran.
But when I checked the cran incoming website, i saw it was put under folder "archive", which means (I think) rejection. Not even pretest, just straight rejection. But i got no mail from cran. Did I miss something?

Most excellent work. I suspected this, but was not careful enough: I looked
for SIGKILL so 'today I learned' about SIGXCPU.

My recommendation ended up being the same though: those files should to be
smaller / simpler.

As far as I know, and as best as I can tell, there is *always* an email as
this is driven by a scripted process.

Now email / SMTP reliability is not what it used to be, outages happen
(e.g. Uwe acknowledged that U Dortmund had a recent mishap -- but mail was
still queued and delivered), spam is an issue etc so I would carefully check
spam folders and alike. It would be nice if there was redundancy (i.e. an
email and public webpage log) but we all wish for different ponies.

Also, I am glad to hear you made progress at your end. You could use GitHub
Actions to run a Debian container and use clang-21 or clang-22, possibly with
the more taxing -O3 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 settings, and see if the build times
is net improved. Chances are that will help you with the Fedora machine in
Oxford too.

Cheers, Dirk

Thank you for your answers, Dirk and Ivan!

With your help I managed to reduce the compilation time on CRAN Debian pretest (from [89s/32s] to [48s/20s]) by modifying the Makevars of the rsofun package.
It appears that there is still some multi-core going on (see [1]) but probably since this is just < 2.5x it does not trigger the NOTE seen previously.
This is good enough for me.

Thanks again and best regards,
Fabian

 Changes
Message-ID: <26857.7009.739947.474897@paul.eddelbuettel.com>


Armadillo 15.0.* brought upstream changes that lead to two CRAN 'Deadlines'.
A lot of packages have adjusted, some more still seem to need help.

I detailed this, and the nine (!!) issue tickets around this having further
detail in a blog post [1] I don't want to repeat here. But the crux of it is:
If you have a package using RcppArmadillo, and you are facing the upcoming
deadlines, I can offer help in on-line office hours you can book (using a
service I had not used before, so a small experiment -- fingers crossed).

Please consult the post linked below for the details and link. See you there!

Cheers, Dirk

Message-ID: <CABeHTUC033AJazdXLc-A9qyR4Pq3Nz8yg5OW0zeJgB63SQ8zog@mail.gmail.com>

The plotly R package is a tool that makes the Shiny and the
RMarkdown/Quarto HTML formats truly shine. According to this community
announcement, the Plotly organization is preparing to retire R
documentation in November 2025.
https://forum.posit.co/t/plotly-is-retiring-its-r-documentation/208325

I don't want to come across as disparaging the work of other package
creators - there are alternatives for time-series data like dygraphs, newer
projects like ggiraph are taking a stab at interactive plots as ggplot2
focused extension, the rgl package provides a low-level, flexible 3D
plotting capabilities, other interactive GIS libraries provide good mapping
tools, and echarts4r shows promise. However, no single package is as widely
used or provides the full feature-set that the plotly package does today
for interactive visualization. Just based on Stack Overflow question
volume, plotly is used at least an order of magnitude more than any of the
alternatives mentioned above.

To say the least, losing this part of the R ecosystem would create a hole
that might not be filled for some time.

I have opened Issue #2456 on the Github repo for community discussion.
https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/issues/2456

Message-ID: <CP5P284MB1870E5D161D7E535CDA0CFECA7EAA@CP5P284MB1870.BRAP284.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello everyone,
I recently updated the roxygen2 version used in my package (SPIChanges on CRAN<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SPIChanges/index.html>) from v7.3.2 to v7.3.3.
Running the following checks:

  *
devtools::check(remote = TRUE, manual = TRUE)
  *
devtools::check_win_devel()

produces no errors, warnings, or notes, and devtools::install() works perfectly.
However, when I run:

devtools::document(roclets = c("rd", "collate", "namespace"))


I get the message:

? SPIChanges.R:52: @autoglobal is not a known tag


Could someone please advise on how to fix this issue in the new package version?
Thanks in advance for your help,
Gabriel Blain

This tag is apparently provided by the (additional) package `roxyglobals` so
you should consult its documentation e.g. at

  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxyglobals/refman/roxyglobals.html

Did you search for a solution? I did... and apparently this feature is not supplied by devtools.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] "Undefined global functions or variables" locally but
 NOT on GitHub
Message-ID: <a8a20ef6-fbbd-4059-a5bf-9dea5c090230@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


GitHub actions has seen no problems with:


https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData


However, R CMD check on my local computer cannot find any of the 
datasets defined in this package. I think I have the current version of 
everything including upgrading macOS to 26.0.1, upgrading RStudio and 
running "update.packages()". I've studied Wickham and Bryan, R Packages, 
without finding how to fix this problem. I've compared the roxygen2 code 
in this package with data documentation in other tidyverse packages 
without being able to resolve this issue. Below please find 
sessionInfo() and 00check.log from "R CMD check MaddisonData_0.0.1.tar.gz".


Suggestions? Thanks, Spencer Graves


p.s. I was having the same problem with 
"github.com/sbgraves237/SS4Maddison", so I created the MaddisonData 
project from scratch and copied only what I needed from SS4Maddison. The 
problem followed me.

Hi:

Maybe remove those rda files from .Rbuildignore (as in a previous question)?



Have a nice day!

Datasets are somewhat special, in that they are not in the namespace of the package. So, you can't access them with the '::' operator, you need to use data(). When inside functions, preferably with envir = environment() to avoid putting the datasets in the user's workspace, see the help page of data().

This is also explicit in R Internals 1.17 ([1], emphasis added): "Lazy-load databases are loaded into the exports for a package, but not into the namespace environment itself. Thus they are visible when the package is attached, ***and also via the :: operator.***?

As Chris Black pointed out, you can use `::`. The help page for `data()` recommends this approach for Spencer?s use case:

"In the unusual case that a package uses a lazy-loaded dataset as a default argument to a function, that needs to be specified by :: <http://127.0.0.1:16056/help/library/utils/help/%3A%3A>, e.g., survival::survexp.us."

Thanks to all who replied. John Benninghoff and Georgi Boshnakov 
suggested I use the "::" operator. That fixed that problem.


Please excuse: Since those objects were part of the package under 
development, it didn't occur to me that I would need that.


ANOTHER QUESTION: I'm getting:

checking package vignettes ... NOTE
   Duplicated vignette title:
     ?UpdateMaddisonData?
   Ensure that the %\VignetteIndexEntry lines in the vignette sources
   correspond to the vignette titles.


I think I've done that: In


https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData/blob/main/vignettes/UpdateMaddisonData.Rmd


title: "UpdateMaddisonData"


...


   %\VignetteIndexEntry{UpdateMaddisonData}


** Both title and %\VignetteIndexEntry match each other and the filename.


???


Thanks, Spencer Graves

Hi Spencer,

I believe the issue is that you have the same VignetteIndexEntry

%\VignetteIndexEntry{UpdateMaddisonData}"

in _both_ of those vignettes. So I think you want the other one to be:

%\VignetteIndexEntry{SS4Maddison}"

See

https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData/blob/main/vignettes/SS4Maddison.Rmd#L7
and
https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData/blob/main/vignettes/UpdateMaddisonData.Rmd#L5

Hope that helps!

Hi, Nicholas:


Thanks very much. I see it now and fixed it.


(I should have grepped for it in the vignette's folder, but I didn't 
think to do that before I posted the question.)
