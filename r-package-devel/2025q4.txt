See Section 1.6 "Writing Portable Packages" of _Writing R Extensions_ under
the bullet point for `make`:

   ? If your package has a ?Makevars? or ?Makefile? file, make sure that
     you use only portable make features.  Such files should be
     LF-terminated(2) (including the final line of the file) and not
     make use of GNU extensions.  (The POSIX specification is available
     at
     <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html>;
     anything not documented there should be regarded as an extension to
     be avoided.  Further advice can be found at
     <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Portable-Make>.
     )  Commonly misused GNU extensions are conditional inclusions
     (?ifeq? and the like), ?${shell ...}?, ?${wildcard ...}? and
     similar, and the use of ?+=?(3) and ?:=?.  Also, the use of ?$<?
     other than in implicit rules is a GNU extension, as is the ?$^?
     macro.  As is the use of ?.PHONY? (some other makes ignore it).
     Unfortunately makefiles which use GNU extensions often run on other
     platforms but do not have the intended results.

     Note that the ?-C? flag for ?make? is not included in the POSIX
     specification and is not implemented by some of the ?make?s which
     have been used with R. However, it is more commonly implemented
     (e.g. by FreeBSD ?make?) than the GNU-specific ?--directory=?.

     You should not rely on built-in/default ?make? rules, even when
     specified by POSIX, as some ?make?s do not have the POSIX ones and
     others have altered them.

     The use of ?${shell ...}? can be avoided by using backticks, e.g.

          PKG_CPPFLAGS = `gsl-config --cflags`

     which works in all versions of ?make? known(4) to be used with R.

     If you really must require GNU make, declare it in the
     ?DESCRIPTION? file by

          SystemRequirements: GNU make

     and ensure that you use the value of environment variable ?MAKE?
     (and not just ?make?) in your scripts.  (On some platforms GNU make
     is available under a name such as ?gmake?, and there
     ?SystemRequirements? is used to set ?MAKE?.)  Your ?configure?
     script (or similar) does need to check that the executable pointed
     to by ?MAKE? is indeed GNU make.

     If you only need GNU make for parts of the package which are rarely
     needed (for example to create bibliography files under
     ?vignettes?), use a file called ?GNUmakefile? rather than
     ?Makefile? as GNU make (only) will use the former.

     macOS has used GNU make for many years (it previously used BSD
     make), but the version has been frozen at 3.81 (from 2006).

     Since the only viable make for Windows is GNU make, it is
     permissible to use GNU extensions in files ?Makevars.win?,
     ?Makevars.ucrt?, ?Makefile.win? or ?Makefile.ucrt?.

You either comply, or you declare 'SystemRequirements: GNU make' as many
packages do. There is no gradient here.

Hope this helps, Dirk

I would recommend investing some time in a (possibly Docker-based) setup that
closely matches the system where this failed so see if you can replicate it
so that you can try to find ways to avoid it.

For what it is worth, I did a quick-ish test in a r2u-based container (based
on Ubuntu 24.04), installed your dependencies (as binaries apart from
GeneralizedUmatrix) as well as this package. It passes its regression tests
and did not segfault.

That does not prove correctness. The next step is then often to try tools
like valgrind or ASAN/SAN, also in containers, to get other hints.  I have
been this for a number years (decades actually) and often thought "well CRAN
must be wrong here". They never were. The tests are there for a reason, even
if it pains us.

(I would also think about changing the language on your webpage. Referring to
two packages as CRAN packages when they are not does not help casual users.)

Cheers, Dirk

Just from these two lines, one can't tell what was the problem. It would 
be slightly better to see complete outputs of the failed checks, that 
could give a hint where it failed.

To provoke the crash on a system where it normally doesn't happen, one 
might try using gc torture (see ?gctorture). Also one might try running 
with address sanitizer/valgrind to see if those tools could find a 
memory error. Possibly one could run only a smaller part of the check, 
based on the output - e.g. if it crashes while running a specific 
example, one might try just running that example in isolation (with 
gctorture, valgrind, etc).

Certainly that it crashes on some platforms means there is an error (in 
the package, or depenendent packages, or possibly used libraries or R).

Hi Everyone,

One of the functions in my DiNAMIC.Duo package on CRAN uses the biomaRt package to download gene position information from the Ensembl website.  Currently I use one of the Ensembl archives (ensemblHost=http://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org in the code below).  The archive is unavailable periodically, so the function includes the following code in an effort to ??fail gracefully,?? as is required by CRAN:

statusCode = curl::curl_fetch_memory(ensemblHost)$status_code
if (statusCode != 200)
{
stop(paste(ensemblHost, "currently not available"))
}

I recently received a notice from CRAN stating that that an error was received when checking examples with ?Vrun-donttest.  Specifically, the following:

Error in `req_perform()`:
! Failed to perform HTTP request.
Caused by error in `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`:

Hi everyone,

I submitted an update for my broadcast R-package yesterday on CRAN.
Prior to submission I checked the package with R CMD check, devtools::check_win_devel(), with devtools::check_mac_release(), and with various operating systems via GitHub actions.
No problems were found.

But I see on the CRAN page that the new version of broadcast fails to install on r-devel fedora clang.
The install log can be found here: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00install.html

It's unclear to me why exactly installation fails. The only concrete statement I can find in the install log is "CPU time limit exceeded". Does this mean the installation simply took too long? If it is something else, what then happened exactly? And how can I fix it?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Tony

Message-ID: <188A464A-2FCF-4FF5-B7D0-D39A9D7B64EE@unibe.ch>

Dear list members,

We are trying to get our package rsofun updated on CRAN. The source code is hosted in the master branch at: https://github.com/geco-bern/rsofun

The CRAN pretest fails on Debian with the NOTE: ?Installation took CPU time 2.8 times elapsed time?. For full output see: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rsofun_5.1.0_20251001_152239/

From what I gathered, the discrepancy between walltime and elapsed time hints at use of more than two cores. Note that contrary to issues I found online, here it appears to be linked to installation of the package and not the test suite, examples, or vignettes. Test suite, examples, and vignettes report equal walltime and elapsed time.

The cookbook (https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/code_issues.html) suggests use of the j-flag for compilation (which I am unsure how to implement). Whereas LLMs suggest to ensure all dependencies are stated in ?src/Makevars? (which I tried to ensure). However still no success with the current version of the code.

I would appreciate any suggestions how to resolve this.
Best regards!

I cannot replicate this in a container running r2u (to get all your nunerous
dependencies quickly as binaries) running Ubuntu 24.04:

  [...]
  * checking whether package ?rsofun? can be installed ... OK
  * used C compiler: ?gcc (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0?
  * used Fortran compiler: ?GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0?
  * checking installed package size ... OK  
  [...]

so you could try to ask this if this may have to do with their use of clang
and flang-new. That said, I somehow doubt that is the case as it would hit
every package with Fortran sources.

>From a first glance your src/Makevars is correct (and elaborate). You do not
ask for any parallel compilation (which is what this check is about -- as
CRAN runs many builds and checks in parallel in their server they have to
ensure no one build 'runs away' with resources).

Yet if you look at the 00install.out in that URL reference you see that your
compilations _happens twice_ once before and and once after the linking of
rsofun.so. I cannot say if that causes it, but I would try to rework that:
there should be no need to compile the Fortran files and wrappersc.c twice.

This may be a compiler error in that (new-ish) version of clang.

A good first step would be to see if another build of clang-21 succeeds,
ideally on a similar Fedora system, else on whatever other system you can
deploy clang-21. There have been prior discussions of this here, as I recall
clang you can nightlies from clang for Debian; I do not know if they offer
that for Fedora. See https://apt.llvm.org/

[ Some time later ]

Ok, I just installed your package onto a rocker/r-base container (running
Debian testing/unstable) with both clang-21 and clang-22 in turn. [1] So you
could try to email CRAN suggestion their particular build of clang-21 may
have an issue. You may want to replicate what I did here with the exact
compiler flags they used to be sure. It would also help to get clang-21 on
Fedora but I am not sure it is pre-made somewhere and building it from source
is of course more work.

Hope this helps,  Dirk

[1 ] I had to muck a little longer than I should have to get the apt repo
setup -- the website lists the old 'list' format of apt files, we now need / prefer
the newer 'sources' format with a key. I will try to write that up as I am
sure I will need it again.

Thank you for consulting the cookbook! If all you have is Makevars,
there should be no need for setting the -j flag anywhere; that advice
is there for the CMake+Ninja and Rust build systems, which default to
using all available cores.

This is good advice (you need the dependencies in case someone does run
MAKEFLAGS=-j$(nproc) R CMD INSTALL rsofun_*.tar.gz), but it won't help
you with unintended installation-time parallelism. Your current
Makevars, as noted by Dirk, has mistakes in the stated dependencies:

>> all: $(SHLIB) clean

This is wrong because it implies that 'make clean' could be started at
the same time while $(SHLIB) is being built, removing the object files
that $(SHLIB) actually depends upon.

Removing the 'all: clean' dependency (but keeping 'all: $(SHLIB)' as the
first target), removing the additional dependencies of $(SHLIB), and
using the output of the following Perl program for all dependency
information helps your package survive installation with MAKEFLAGS=-j2:

perl -lne '
	my $o = $ARGV =~ s/[.]f90$/.o/r;
	$modules{$1} = $o
		if /^\s*module\s+(\w+)/;
	push @{$uses{$o}}, $1
		if /^\s*use\s*(\w+)/;
}{
	while (my ($k, $v) = each %modules) {
		print "$k.mod: $v";
	}
	while (my ($k, $v) = each %uses) {
		print "$k: ", join " ", map "$_.mod", @$v;
	}
' *.f90

While the build system trying to be too helpful is a common case of
this NOTE (in which case the solution is easy), it is not the only
possible explanation. We've also seen GCC internally spawn too many
child processes for link-time optimisation (system setup problem, not a
package problem, since fixed) and a package accidentally spawning too
many OpenMP threads in .onLoad for a short while, affecting some of its
reverse dependencies (also fixed).

Let's try to see which parts of R CMD INSTALL create child threads.
It's not the only way extra CPU time could be spent (and not the only
way threads could be created), but you have to start somewhere.

wget https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/rsofun_5.1.0.tar.gz
ltrace -w 10 -f -e pthread_create -- \
 sh -c 'R CMD INSTALL -l rsofun.Rcheck rsofun_5.1.0.tar.gz'

Does the package or its dependencies do something strange while
preparing the namespace? No, 'cli' only starts a single thread and
that's it. Does the compiler start extra threads? Why yes, it does:

flang-new-19  -fpic  -g  -c  main_pmodel.mod.f90 -o main_pmodel.mod.o
[pid 13542] --- Called exec() ---

On my 16-thread machine this varies per file (up to 16 threads in the
pool for the largest file) and results in an average load of 18s user /
15s real = 1.2. It's not implausible that the older 2x Xeon E5-2690
running the incoming pretests at CRAN (with 32 threads in total) end up
at 280% average CPU load due to flang-new-19's multi-threading.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any way to disable LLVM multi-threading
at runtime, short of recompiling LLVM.

Tony,

The script below should set you up for clang-22 on the rocker/r-base
container running Debian testing/unstable, and ensure R uses clang-22.

The fact that clang-22 passes the build whereas as the clang-21 version at
CRAN encounters an error may be indicative on an issue in that clang-21, but
it is hard to tell for sure.

For another test I ensured I also used -O3 and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 (switching
from the Debian defaults of 2). There are a number of other flags that
differ, and they may matter.  It still appears to build (if slowly, seems
like there is a fair bit of complex C++ in there). [ Minutes later ] It seems
to hang at compilation of rcpp_bc_b.cpp.  So the higher optimization level on
the Fedora machine at CRAN may have something to do with this -- using -O2
and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 worked here.  You could ask for re-check given that
clang 21 and 22 apparently build your package in the Debian container I used,
at least with the lower default values used by the Debian setup.

Hi everyone,

Sorry, false alarm.
There's probably no problem on the side of CRAN.
The problem was probably on my side.

My code is not wrong per-s?, but I created an additional if()else() statement in rcpp_bc_b, but left the MACRO - which itself has many if-else statements - the same. And each of those "if" leads to a whole set of for-loops, thus causing the compiled code to become much larger than necessary. And the compiler for fedora clang took too long to compile that script as a consequence, creating an installation fail.

I've already send a fixed version, broadcast 0.1.5.1, to CRAN, that should fix this issue.

Kind regards,

Tony

Onderwerp: new package version fails on r-devel fedora clang

Hi everyone,

I submitted an update for my broadcast R-package yesterday on CRAN.
Prior to submission I checked the package with R CMD check, devtools::check_win_devel(), with devtools::check_mac_release(), and with various operating systems via GitHub actions.
No problems were found.

But I see on the CRAN page that the new version of broadcast fails to install on r-devel fedora clang.
The install log can be found here: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00install.html

It's unclear to me why exactly installation fails. The only concrete statement I can find in the install log is "CPU time limit exceeded". Does this mean the installation simply took too long? If it is something else, what then happened exactly? And how can I fix it?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Tony

Dear all

In recent days, I also experienced that I did not receive an email with a
link to the check results from winbuilder after uploading an improved
version of my micEcon package. On Friday morning (CEST), I uploaded the
package twice to both R-release and R-devel but I didn't receive any email.
Yesterday (Saturday) afternoon/evening I tried again and received an email
with the results of the check with R-release but not with R-devel. As there
was a warning, I uploaded a further improved package to both R-release and
R-devel last night. Although I did this twice, I didn't receive any email.
I checked my GMail spam folder but the emails aren't there either.  In
total, 5 times uploaded to R-release but only 1 email with results and 5
times uploaded to R-devel but no response at all. I have regularly used
winbuilder for many years but never experienced this problem before. Please
check this. Thanks a lot!

Best wishes,
Arne

Hi Vonn,

You could wrap the offending example in try et.al. and handle failed situations in a way that gives a warning but not an error.

Best,
Berry

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package cannot connect to Ensembl

Hi Everyone,

One of the functions in my DiNAMIC.Duo package on CRAN uses the biomaRt package to download gene position information from the Ensembl website.  Currently I use one of the Ensembl archives (ensemblHost=http://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org in the code below).  The archive is unavailable periodically, so the function includes the following code in an effort to ??fail gracefully,?? as is required by CRAN:

statusCode = curl::curl_fetch_memory(ensemblHost)$status_code
if (statusCode != 200)
{
stop(paste(ensemblHost, "currently not available"))
}

I recently received a notice from CRAN stating that that an error was received when checking examples with ?Vrun-donttest.  Specifically, the following:

Error in `req_perform()`:
! Failed to perform HTTP request.
Caused by error in `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`:
! SSL connect error [aug2020.archive.ensembl.org]:

Any suggestions on how to revise the existing code would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your reply.

Hello everyone,

I have fixed the 'broadcast' package (updated to version 0.1.5.1), but there is still an installation error on r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00check.html.
Either there is still an issue with broadcast, or there is actually an issue with the compiler CRAN uses for fedora.
If there is still an issue with broadcast: What exactly is the issue? The install.log is not clear to me.
If there is an issue on the side of CRAN: May I respectfully request CRAN to double-check their clang compiler and re-run the checks for broadcast 0.1.5.1?

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

Tony

Hi Dirk and CRAN,


@Dirk: thanks so much for the trouble!

I actually think I know what went wrong. My code is not wrong per-s?.
I created an addition if()else() statement in rcpp_bc_b, but left the MACRO - which itself has many if-else statements - the same. And each of those "if" leads to a whole set of for-loops, thus causing the compiled code to become much larger than necessary.

It's very easy to fix.
But it does feel like a rookie mistake; sorry for the trouble!

@CRAN: Sorry! I was wrong, and your system is probably correct. If it's OK with you, I'll send an updated version of 'broadcast' tonight. That should fix the error in the Fedora clang checks.

Kind regards,

Tony

Yes, it works again :-) Thanks a lot, Uwe, for fixing this! ...and
thanks a lot to you and the entire CRAN team for your fantastic work!

The error log at
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/broadcast-00install.html
makes it pretty clear that there's a bug in the compiler being used on
that CRAN machine, but that might still not absolve you of the
responsibility of working around the issue.

At least, this line:

5. Running pass "jump-threading" on function
"_Z16rcpp_bcRel_dec_dP7SEXPRECS0_S0_S0_S0_S0_S0_lid"

indicates that the bug is happening while compiling the
'cpp_bcRel_dec_d' function.

Is there another way of expressing the computation you're doing in
that function that might avoid hitting this issue? From a brief scan
of the code, it's hard to give concrete advice because of the heavy
use of macros within that code.

Best,
Kevin

Hi Kevin, CRAN, and the rest,

Thank you for your answer, Kevin, I appreciate it!

If there is an issue in the compiler CRAN uses, it seems reasonable that CRAN fixes that.
I also don't know how to work around a bug in a compiler. How would you even do that?

Literally the only concrete thing Brian Ripley said to me was "Taking 5h CPU time to (fail to) install is unreasonable -- resubmitting without addressing the problem more so." Ignoring the fact that I did indeed try to address the problem, the only think I can do (and have been doing), is trying to reduce the compiled size of the C/C++ code, to reduce installation time.

But if there is a bug in CRAN's compiler, re-submitting will probably just end up getting another fail, regardless of how small the package becomes. That would be a waste of CRAN's time and resources. I appreciate CRAN, and so I don't like wasting their time and resources.

@BrianRipley/@CRAN: I'm very willing to submit a package with a significantly smaller compiled size (and thus hopefully faster installation). But I ask again: please be so kind to at least check your clang compiler. Asking me to fix a problem caused by CRAN's own compiler seems unreasonable. If you say the compiler is good or has been fixed, I'll re-submit my package with the reduced size & installation time. Does that sound fair?

Thanks in advance for your response!

Kind regards,

Tony

In an ideal world, sure. But please keep in mind that CRAN's resources are
somewhat limited. There are over a thousand of us package maintainers, and
only about four (core) CRAN maintainers looking after the key machines, and a
few CRAN helpers aiding with various tasks.

| I also don't know how to work around a bug in a compiler. How would you even do that?

Maybe rearrange / rewrite your code?  As I mentioned to you (following up
off-list to initial on-list email) when both option values are increased from
level two (which I see used by default on Debian for both -O2 and for
-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2; Ubuntu seems to use -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 with -O2) to
level three the compilation of file rcpp_bc_b.cpp takes a really long time
but passes. On Fedora at CRAN it fails, and we do not know if that is an
genuine error or a resource limit.

My first instinct would be to make this file smaller but replacing it with
two, three, ... smaller files that tax the compiler less.
 
| Literally the only concrete thing Brian Ripley said to me was "Taking 5h CPU time to (fail to) install is unreasonable -- resubmitting without addressing the problem more so." Ignoring the fact that I did indeed try to address the problem, the only think I can do (and have been doing), is trying to reduce the compiled size of the C/C++ code, to reduce installation time.
| 
| But if there is a bug in CRAN's compiler, re-submitting will probably just end up getting another fail, regardless of how small the package becomes. That would be a waste of CRAN's time and resources. I appreciate CRAN, and so I don't like wasting their time and resources.

It is still an 'if'. We suggested to you that you need to reproduce it.

I read the (private, I assume) reply by Brian Ripley as indicating that a
resource watcher on his machine killed the compilation. The compilation could
also have been killed. I do not know. I know that I built your package with
the same clang version (as mentioned in my emails) on a different distro (so
under slightly different values).

| @BrianRipley/@CRAN: I'm very willing to submit a package with a significantly smaller compiled size (and thus hopefully faster installation). But I ask again: please be so kind to at least check your clang compiler. Asking me to fix a problem caused by CRAN's own compiler seems unreasonable. If you say the compiler is good or has been fixed, I'll re-submit my package with the reduced size & installation time. Does that sound fair?

If possible, please try to reproduce and then address the issue in a similar
setting. I recommend Docker with a Fedora image, with luck the newest Fedora
Core may have clang21 you can use. Else use Debian as I showed you. Recognize
compilation limits in time and memory and aim to reduce them.  CRAN runs many
builds in parallel, when I noted to you that it took a long time locally I
was doing this on a recent-ish and reasonably able machine with lots of
memory free for that build.

Hope this helps, and that you get your package adjusted.

Cheers, Dirk

For example, the SQLite developers have to do that every now and then:
https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/f0f921bb80b50959d50f5f560d42fef940ba9a78aa254703bb04cd680b261f11

If the bug is reported to the compiler developers, sometimes it's
fixed, but that may take months (or years...), and the already released
versions of the compiler that still have the bug stay in use for much
longer: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/70828

Clang is programmed to print a message saying "PLEASE submit a bug
report" when it receives an unexpected fatal signal. Here, the fatal
signal is SIGXCPU, delivered by the kernel because of the 90-minute
per-process CPU time limit set for the job [0]. This is not a crash,
you can see this for yourself using something like

( ulimit -S -t 2; R -q -s -e 'repeat runif(100)' )

The bits of information we have are Ttotal=19394.68s [1], the R CMD
check output [2] saying that R CMD INSTALL tool 94 minutes of real time
but 323 minutes of userspace plus kernel CPU time, and 00install.log
saying that the processes being stopped for going over the limit are
compiling rcpp_bcRel_dec.cpp and rcpp_bc_int.cpp.

Using compilers from [3], it's possible to reproduce something similar
to but not as drastic as the problem visible on CRAN:

/usr/bin/time \

450924maxresident)k
0inputs+1888outputs (0major+74883426minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Why does it take more than 90 minutes of CPU time on the Fedora
machine running CRAN checks but only ~11 minutes on my lab workstation?
This probably has to do with 7 years of difference between the CPUs
running the code: Prof. Brian D. Ripley uses a server-oriented Intel
Xeon E5-2440 from ~2012, while mine is a desktop-oriented Ryzen from
2019.

Preprocessing the *.cpp files from your package and passing them
through clang-format, I see a lot of declarations and some inline
functions from Rcpp, but the code from files rcpp_bc_b.cpp,
rcpp_bc_int.cpp, and rcpp_bcRel_dec.cpp expands to tens of thousands of
lines on top of that, with some blocks nested ~28 times. Perhaps you
could join the #llvm channel at irc.oftc.net and ask for
recommendations regarding this kind of code? You may have a genuine
performance bug report on your hands.

With the deadline looming, are there any workarounds that would stop
the acute symptoms without spending the time treating the underlying
condition? It might help to put each macro-heavy function into a
separate *.cpp file, but I haven't tested that suggestion.

Most excellent work. I suspected this, but was not careful enough: I looked
for SIGKILL so 'today I learned' about SIGXCPU.

My recommendation ended up being the same though: those files should to be
smaller / simpler.

Should we ask the LLVM team if they think it's worth handling the
SIGXCPU signal in an alternate way? Since the message they're printing
here implies it's a bug in the compiler... or at least, they could
print the signal number / signal name in the message log produced.
Unless I missed something?

In any case, I agree with the other suggestions re: splitting those
functions out into separate files.

Another thing worth trying would be to try porting some of these
functions from C++ to C -- as far as I can see, you aren't making use
of (any?) C++-specific features, beyond the automatic generation of
interfaces offered by Rcpp. You could even keep the C++ interfaces
auto-generated by Rcpp, but have those call back to separate C
functions each defined in separate files, just to keep life simple.

Best,
Kevin

Hi everyone,

I followed the given advise to the best of my abilities: rewritten some c++ scripts to c, split large c++ scripts into smaller pieces, simplified the macros, reduced the install size & time of the package, and checked the package against fedora clang using rhub (unfortunately they didnt have clang21, but I checked what I could).
I re-submitted the new version pf package, version 0.1.5.2, to cran.
But when I checked the cran incoming website, i saw it was put under folder "archive", which means (I think) rejection. Not even pretest, just straight rejection. But i got no mail from cran. Did I miss something?

Most excellent work. I suspected this, but was not careful enough: I looked
for SIGKILL so 'today I learned' about SIGXCPU.

My recommendation ended up being the same though: those files should to be
smaller / simpler.

As far as I know, and as best as I can tell, there is *always* an email as
this is driven by a scripted process.

Now email / SMTP reliability is not what it used to be, outages happen
(e.g. Uwe acknowledged that U Dortmund had a recent mishap -- but mail was
still queued and delivered), spam is an issue etc so I would carefully check
spam folders and alike. It would be nice if there was redundancy (i.e. an
email and public webpage log) but we all wish for different ponies.

Also, I am glad to hear you made progress at your end. You could use GitHub
Actions to run a Debian container and use clang-21 or clang-22, possibly with
the more taxing -O3 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 settings, and see if the build times
is net improved. Chances are that will help you with the Fedora machine in
Oxford too.

Cheers, Dirk

Thank you for your answers, Dirk and Ivan!

With your help I managed to reduce the compilation time on CRAN Debian pretest (from [89s/32s] to [48s/20s]) by modifying the Makevars of the rsofun package.
It appears that there is still some multi-core going on (see [1]) but probably since this is just < 2.5x it does not trigger the NOTE seen previously.
This is good enough for me.

Thanks again and best regards,
Fabian

 Changes
Message-ID: <26857.7009.739947.474897@paul.eddelbuettel.com>


Armadillo 15.0.* brought upstream changes that lead to two CRAN 'Deadlines'.
A lot of packages have adjusted, some more still seem to need help.

I detailed this, and the nine (!!) issue tickets around this having further
detail in a blog post [1] I don't want to repeat here. But the crux of it is:
If you have a package using RcppArmadillo, and you are facing the upcoming
deadlines, I can offer help in on-line office hours you can book (using a
service I had not used before, so a small experiment -- fingers crossed).

Please consult the post linked below for the details and link. See you there!

Cheers, Dirk

Message-ID: <CABeHTUC033AJazdXLc-A9qyR4Pq3Nz8yg5OW0zeJgB63SQ8zog@mail.gmail.com>

The plotly R package is a tool that makes the Shiny and the
RMarkdown/Quarto HTML formats truly shine. According to this community
announcement, the Plotly organization is preparing to retire R
documentation in November 2025.
https://forum.posit.co/t/plotly-is-retiring-its-r-documentation/208325

I don't want to come across as disparaging the work of other package
creators - there are alternatives for time-series data like dygraphs, newer
projects like ggiraph are taking a stab at interactive plots as ggplot2
focused extension, the rgl package provides a low-level, flexible 3D
plotting capabilities, other interactive GIS libraries provide good mapping
tools, and echarts4r shows promise. However, no single package is as widely
used or provides the full feature-set that the plotly package does today
for interactive visualization. Just based on Stack Overflow question
volume, plotly is used at least an order of magnitude more than any of the
alternatives mentioned above.

To say the least, losing this part of the R ecosystem would create a hole
that might not be filled for some time.

I have opened Issue #2456 on the Github repo for community discussion.
https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/issues/2456

Message-ID: <CP5P284MB1870E5D161D7E535CDA0CFECA7EAA@CP5P284MB1870.BRAP284.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello everyone,
I recently updated the roxygen2 version used in my package (SPIChanges on CRAN<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SPIChanges/index.html>) from v7.3.2 to v7.3.3.
Running the following checks:

  *
devtools::check(remote = TRUE, manual = TRUE)
  *
devtools::check_win_devel()

produces no errors, warnings, or notes, and devtools::install() works perfectly.
However, when I run:

devtools::document(roclets = c("rd", "collate", "namespace"))


I get the message:

? SPIChanges.R:52: @autoglobal is not a known tag


Could someone please advise on how to fix this issue in the new package version?
Thanks in advance for your help,
Gabriel Blain

This tag is apparently provided by the (additional) package `roxyglobals` so
you should consult its documentation e.g. at

  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxyglobals/refman/roxyglobals.html

Did you search for a solution? I did... and apparently this feature is not supplied by devtools.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] "Undefined global functions or variables" locally but
 NOT on GitHub
Message-ID: <a8a20ef6-fbbd-4059-a5bf-9dea5c090230@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


GitHub actions has seen no problems with:


https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData


However, R CMD check on my local computer cannot find any of the 
datasets defined in this package. I think I have the current version of 
everything including upgrading macOS to 26.0.1, upgrading RStudio and 
running "update.packages()". I've studied Wickham and Bryan, R Packages, 
without finding how to fix this problem. I've compared the roxygen2 code 
in this package with data documentation in other tidyverse packages 
without being able to resolve this issue. Below please find 
sessionInfo() and 00check.log from "R CMD check MaddisonData_0.0.1.tar.gz".


Suggestions? Thanks, Spencer Graves


p.s. I was having the same problem with 
"github.com/sbgraves237/SS4Maddison", so I created the MaddisonData 
project from scratch and copied only what I needed from SS4Maddison. The 
problem followed me.

Hi:

Maybe remove those rda files from .Rbuildignore (as in a previous question)?



Have a nice day!

Datasets are somewhat special, in that they are not in the namespace of the package. So, you can't access them with the '::' operator, you need to use data(). When inside functions, preferably with envir = environment() to avoid putting the datasets in the user's workspace, see the help page of data().

This is also explicit in R Internals 1.17 ([1], emphasis added): "Lazy-load databases are loaded into the exports for a package, but not into the namespace environment itself. Thus they are visible when the package is attached, ***and also via the :: operator.***?

As Chris Black pointed out, you can use `::`. The help page for `data()` recommends this approach for Spencer?s use case:

"In the unusual case that a package uses a lazy-loaded dataset as a default argument to a function, that needs to be specified by :: <http://127.0.0.1:16056/help/library/utils/help/%3A%3A>, e.g., survival::survexp.us."

Thanks to all who replied. John Benninghoff and Georgi Boshnakov 
suggested I use the "::" operator. That fixed that problem.


Please excuse: Since those objects were part of the package under 
development, it didn't occur to me that I would need that.


ANOTHER QUESTION: I'm getting:

checking package vignettes ... NOTE
   Duplicated vignette title:
     ?UpdateMaddisonData?
   Ensure that the %\VignetteIndexEntry lines in the vignette sources
   correspond to the vignette titles.


I think I've done that: In


https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData/blob/main/vignettes/UpdateMaddisonData.Rmd


title: "UpdateMaddisonData"


...


   %\VignetteIndexEntry{UpdateMaddisonData}


** Both title and %\VignetteIndexEntry match each other and the filename.


???


Thanks, Spencer Graves

Hi Spencer,

I believe the issue is that you have the same VignetteIndexEntry

%\VignetteIndexEntry{UpdateMaddisonData}"

in _both_ of those vignettes. So I think you want the other one to be:

%\VignetteIndexEntry{SS4Maddison}"

See

https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData/blob/main/vignettes/SS4Maddison.Rmd#L7
and
https://github.com/sbgraves237/MaddisonData/blob/main/vignettes/UpdateMaddisonData.Rmd#L5

Hope that helps!

Hi, Nicholas:


Thanks very much. I see it now and fixed it.


(I should have grepped for it in the vignette's folder, but I didn't 
think to do that before I posted the question.)

That's true provided the data is lazy-loaded.  The default is "LazyData: 
false", but "LazyData: true" is a pretty common choice because 
usethis::use_data() puts that in DESCRIPTION.

Thanks, Duncan.


This is the first package I've created trying to follow Wickham and 
Bryan, R Packages, including using roxygen2. That DESCRIPTION file 
includes "LazyData: true". I don't remember if I used 
"usethis::use_data()", but I probably did.


I was surprised that I had to use "::" inside "tests/testthat/test-*.R" 
to access a dataset defined in that package! And I seemed to get the 
problem only on my local computer while all 5 standard GitHub Actions 
seemed not to need that.


That's what led me to impose upon the time of the experts who contribute 
to this email list.


Thanks again, Spencer Graves

Yes, the rules for visibility of objects in the `data` directory are 
somewhat strange, but they are documented in "Writing R Extensions", 
section 1.1.6.  They're also summarized here: 
https://stackoverflow.com/a/79122709 .

In defence of the strange rules:  you don't have to use them unless you 
choose to do so. If you want "normal" visibility rules for data, just 
create it using code in the R directory.  Then your data will always be 
visible to functions in your package, and if you export it in the 
NAMESPACE file, always visible to users of your package using the same 
rules as for exported functions.

Message-ID: <CAEkDj=np46X0hUkkUTdi57Jc5XUYhg=tAbdaZLZQfNGB7mycHg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,


I have recently submitted a Go using Package to CRAN and it was
archived (i have yet to receive the rejection email).

I have anticipated the warnings (at least on Unix) and made comments
during the submission. A pointer from Ivan Krylov around the potential
of crashing R in the case of loading multiple go buildmode c-shared
loaded in the same process suggests that my comments may have been
misguided (even though I used the c-archive mode).

I figure for the fairly limited use case and the existing design
strategy of limiting communication between the go and C runtime to
pipes, I can execute an external go process instead. One issue remains
tough, is that in order to build this binary at installation time, a
golang toolchain is required.My package failed on win-builder on
windows because go was not found on the PATH of that machine. And as
it happens that shipping with the package pre-built cross-compiled
binaries like it is done in the  pmtiles  package is not advisable,
options become limited.

Krilov also referenced the case of the adbcbigquery and allied
packages that are likely published on r-multiverse instead of CRAN for
similar reasons.

It would be great if CRAN were to clarify its views on go using
packages and the toolchain.


Thank you in advance

Best regards,

Sounkou Mahamamane Toure

Sounkou,

as usual, you should start with the instructions in "External Libraries for CRAN packages"[1] which really boils down to sending an e-mail to CRAN and CCing me and Uwe. That is assuming that produced Go binaries are self-contained and don't need a run-time. If that's not the case, then it gets a lot more complicated as it would require static run-time built with R tools and that may complicate Windows support substantially (since MXE doesn't have Go AFAICS, you'd have to ask Tomas). In the simple case we can install toolchains on the build machines if they are officially available and compatible. The latter is an issue here as you pointed out so it may be worth discussing that. We may want to test things first before rolling it out.

The way I see it, given the constraints in Go, it would be worthwhile to write something like an "Rgo" package that is the only Go runtime and any R package that wants to add Go code would use it to load its code as Go plugin. This is in concept similar to other languages like Python (reticulate) or Java (rJava) where you always load only one run-time and then simply use the corresponding language-provided loading mechanism to load any additional code/modules. This is just based on a cursory glance, so Go enthusiasts may want to comment on the feasibility.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,

Thank you for this information. I will be reworking my package to use an
external statically linked executable and therefore only require a basic go
installation. I shall send as you said the emails requesting the external
libraries in the case of a second submission to CRAN. In this submission,
the package is likely going to be `Os_type: unix`. There is an existing
MSYS2 go package for the "Rgo" scenario.

As you said, it would be great to get the feedback of the maintainers of
other Go using packages with c-shared/c-archive linking to see if there is
any appetite for a "Rgo" package for safer R/Go interop. I've added the
feedback from this thread as a comment to the arrow-adbc issue. I shall
experiment with the plugin system and see the implementation details of the
other languages.

Thanks in advance,

Sounkou Mahamane Toure

The toolchains and pre-compiled libraries in Rtools come from (slightly 
modified) MXE, not from Msys2. Using the go compiler from Msys2 for 
interoperability within a single address space with code compiled by 
Rtools hence wouldn't be safe.

For interoperability with an external executable (produced by go), one 
can simply use the default go implementation for Windows, it doesn't 
have to come from Msys2.

For interoperatibility within a single address space, the go compiler 
would have to be part of Rtools (and all code coming to that address 
space from the go side would have to be created by compilers in Rtools). 
In principle, it should be possible as GCC supports go.

Tomas

Hi Sounkou,

I will briefly share the journey of adbcsnowfake, which I submitted to 
CRAN at one point. The CRAN team was kind to help me through the 
process; however, I was unable to resolve an issue with an upstream 
dependency that resulted in a warning (the Snowflake Go driver creates a 
temporary file when the shared object is loaded) and I ran out of time 
to pursue the submission. We distribute using the R-multiverse and have 
never had any requests to distribute it on CRAN, which means either that 
the R-multiverse is sufficient for our users or that nobody is using it.

We use the same idea as for Rust - build a C static library at build 
time and call Go using C. The only time we have ever encountered the 
"multiple go runtimes in the same process cause a crash" issue you 
linked was on MacOS Intel (you can give it a try by attempting to use 
more than one of adbcsnowflake, adbcflightsql, and/or adbcbigquery in 
the same R session). I gather there is also potentially high memory 
usage associated with multiple garbage collected pools that hold on to 
memory in the same process.

I was able to achieve an almost warning-free submission with:

- Using go vendor to create a vendor archive (so that go packages 
weren't downloaded during installation)
- Patch C and/or Go sources in the vendor directory that caused check 
warnings
- Create a tarball of the vendor directory and publish on Zenodo (if I 
were doing this again I'd use GitHub with a Zenodo backup because Zenodo 
is slow). I had to do this to keep the tarball under 5 MB (with fewer 
dependencies this might not be necessary).
- Download the vendor tarball at build time

On Windows we use a standard (i.e., not msys2) Go installation for CI 
and development. There may be issues with doing so but we haven't run 
across them...I gather this works because the Go runtime library is 
completely self-contained but I am not an expert. It is, of course, 
necessary to point go build to the proper C compiler/linker/flags on all 
platforms. At the time I submitted adbcsnowflake, A go installation was 
available on the MacOS runner (which Simon had kindly installed to 
support the submission) but not the Windows one.

After all of that I am not sure that I would recommend building R 
packages with Go dependencies, but it can be done and there are some 
fantastic Go libraries that just don't have equivalents in any other 
language (pmtiles is another great example).

Best of luck!

Not widely advertised, but this limit was recently increased; "Source
package tarballs should if possible not exceed 10MB." (

Thanks Simon, Thomas, Dewey and Henrik for the helpful information and
feedback !

Given the restrictions on the go side for the c-shared mode and the fact
that the plugin system that would allow loading safely different go modules
are not portable, I think an IPC road may be more productive.

Given this and the fact that we have a very good Nanomsg binding in R and
there is an official Go version, I will be using that setup for R/Go
interops. Following Dewey, I made a package that vendors the Go binding of
Nanomsg that I hope to submit to CRAN. This setup only requires a suitable
go version (in this case >= 1.21).


Thanks again

Dear all,

I wanted to share a tool revdeprun that I built over the weekend. It might be useful if you maintain R packages with many reverse dependencies.

If you ever needed to run revdepcheck on a disposable cloud instance, you will know that the setup can be tedious. Install R, set environment variables, and handle other details before you can even start the actual checking. revdeprun automates all that. Once installed, you can run a full reverse dependency check with a single command:

    revdeprun https://github.com/username/repo.git

It is written as a Rust CLI tool rather than an R package or a shell script, which makes it a bit easier to compile and run without setting up language runtime.

Thank you,  Nan, in the name of the R community.

As most of my packages are not with Microsoft, i.e., not on Github,
I'd be more interested in a version of your tool that works with
a simple source package tarball, i.e., the file  <pkg>_<version>.tar.gz 
resulting from  'R CMD build <pkgdir>'

In principle that should even be simpler than first getting the
package from the github repos, no?

Best regards,
Martin

Dear Martin,

Thank you for the kind words and the excellent suggestion. I'm pleased to share that tarball input support has been added in revdeprun 1.1.0 (among other improvements since the announcement). You can now run `revdeprun pkg_version.tar.gz` to check a tarball directly.

Best,
-Nan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Reproducing the clang-UBSAN test environment in rhub
 or somewhere else?
Message-ID: <CAPvCojKkPyoiC1Y8PsYCC4=Z2-jfGi-3OhxOmAkzv9fEnnknPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

A recent update to my package has generated an unexpected error in the
clang-UBSAN test environment (as well as gcc-UBSAN):
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_fastTopics.html

However, I could not reproduce this error using rhub (platform =
"gcc-ubsan"), which makes it difficult to troubleshoot (and eventually
correct) this error.

Does anyone have suggestions for how I could reproduce the error (rhub or
otherwise), or is there more detailed documentation somewhere on the
clang-UBSAN environment? I'm at a bit of a loss for how to proceed.

Thank you,

Though, my recommendation would be first to try to figure out the 
problem from the check output - the big advantage of sanitizer checks is 
that one gets a stack trace. And if that doesn't help, add some 
additional runtime (bounds) checks to the code, perhaps the lowest frame 
(last frame) from your package that is included in the stack trace. Once 
that detects the error, then fix it, try again with the added check 
still enabled, and eventually remove (or disable) the check.

Best
Tomas

Peter,

Besides the comments Tomas already made, consider looking more closely at the
vignettes. The error in [0] indicates that this comes from vignettes, not
examples or tests.

I have been providing Docker containers for gcc and clang ASAN/UBSAN for what
must be close to a decade. These often work as they try to follow the setup
used by BDR on his machines. [1] When they fail the very useful 'sumo'
container by Winston often referenced here in threads can also be useful.

So as a test, I pulled a refreshed version of the rocker/r-devel-san
container [2] and installed the (considerable) dependency set of your
packages. As expected, nothing in tests or examples. I then purl'ed the code
out of the vignettes and ran those, and that seems to replicate the issue:

../../src/tbbmalloc/backref.cpp:150:21: runtime error: index 1 out of bounds for type 'BackRefBlock *[1]'
Fitting rank-6 Poisson NMF to 100 x 16791 sparse matrix.        
Running at most 20 SCD updates, without extrapolation (fastTopics 0.7-30). 
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/Mat_meat.hpp:7043:26: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'const double'
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/access.hpp:26:100: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'double'
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/Mat_meat.hpp:7043:26: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'const double'
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/access.hpp:26:100: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'double'
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/subview_meat.hpp:1420:54: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'const double'
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/access.hpp:26:100: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'double'

This could be an upstream issue is Armadillo as wrapped in RcppArmadillo. I
as maintainer need to balance the (frequent) updates upstream with the CRAN
Policy of "no more than six releases in six month" so I have sat out the bug
fix release 15.0.3 as well as the new releases 15.2 and 15.2.1 and not
uploaded them to CRAN.  However, they are packaged at my master branch and
available via R-universe.

So as a test I fetched 15.2.1 from there, installed it, re-installed your
package and ran the test again.  The errors persist suggesting it may be your
code and it creates matrices or matrix views. (Needless to say, the error
could of course also be on our end in RcppArmadillo.)

Would it be possible to simplify the code down to a simpler, self-contained
matrix example not requiring all the packages?  That would also make testing
with the other container quicker as we would not have to reinstall all those
dependencies. 

Another possibility is parallelism as the message comes from tbbmalloc so
maybe trying in serial mode may help?

Lastly, as you asked about rhub: I am not involved with rhub and do not use
it much myself so I cannot help much on that aspect. But if this does not
replicate under their container you should be able to hook up the one used
here, i.e. rocker/r-devel-san (as well as the other one) under GitHub Actions
as they let you pull in other Docker containers (when running under Linux).

It's too nice outside right now here in Chicagoland so I'll now disappear for
a bit on my bike but we can possibly pick this up later.

Cheers, Dirk

[1] In a more ideal world, his tests could be based on containers and these

The UBSan warnings are reported not directly in your package, but in
.../src/tbbmalloc/backref.cpp (RcppParallel) and some paths in
RcppArmadillo. I think the reason why you cannot reproduce the problem
on R-hub is because R-hub containers install dependencies pre-built,
without instrumentation: the check for the problem in your package
needs to happen inside a different package. This usually saves a lot of
CPU-hours running CI for people whose problems are easier to reproduce,
but didn't help this time.

While I was writing this, Dirk has already confirmed that the Rocker
container image is sufficient to reproduce the problem, so hopefully
there's now enough information now to solve it.

Ivan

Hi,


I see Rf_lazy_duplicate was placed on the list of non-API C functions.
Is there going to be a replacement, or some alternative? None is
mentioned in Writing R Extensions.


Thanks,

That is not quite right. Rf_lazy_duplicate was never in the API. Using
it in a package has been producing a NOTE in R CMD check for a while;
that NOTE has now been upgraded to a WARNING.

> Is there going to be a replacement, or some alternative? None is

It has been essentially a no-op since the change to reference counting
several years ago. So Rf_lazy_duplicate(x) is now essentially the same
as x.

I wish you wouldn't be contrarian just for the sake of it, and I wish
you'd at least be correct when you are. I never said Rf_lazy_duplicate
was part of the API. I said it was placed on the list of non-API C
functions, which is true.

3 weeks is not a while.

Thanks.

Right, you didn't write that you thought Rf_lazy_duplicate was part of 
the API. And you got a very polite response, perhaps something worth 
taking an inspiration from. It was polite because it assumed your 
question made sense - it would only have made sense if you thought 
Rf_lazy_duplicate was in the API (and you didn't write otherwise). It is 
unreasonable to expect WRE would discuss replacements for private 
functions for the R engine (after all, before Luke's work on indexing 
the API, functions mentioned in WRE were part of the API by the virtue 
of being mentioned there). Discussing functions private to the R engine 
is out of scope of WRE (or R-pkg-devel for that matter).

Reporting non-API functions used in packages is an important service to 
responsible package authors, who want to cooperate in keeping the R 
ecosystem maintainable.

 Reproducing the clang-UBSAN test environment in rhub
 or somewhere else?

Thanks to all of you (Ivan, Ben, Tomas, Dirk) for your detailed and
informative suggestions, all of which have been deeply helpful, but it took
me some time to act on these suggestions since I am not well versed in
these tools and concepts. (Despite having developed several packages over
the years that use Rcpp and the accompanying packages?RcppArmadillo,
RcppParallel, etc?all of this is almost entirely new to me.)

Most urgently, I have a specific question based on Dirk's response:

The rocker images were indeed super helpful, and I think is getting me very
close to reproducing the original issues ("reference binding to null
pointer?"). I was able to (eventually) set up a r-devel-ubsan-clang
container on my MacBook Pro, install the fastTopics package, and run the
basic checks using "R CMD check ?". (I will share the steps I took since I
figured it might be useful for others trying to reproduce the clang-UBSAN
environment.)

However, I was not able to reproduce the exact errors Dirk obtained by
running the R code purl'ed from the single_cell_rnaseq_basic.Rmd vignette.
I thought that this might work:

R -d valgrind --vanilla < single_cell_rnaseq_basic.R

but this did not produce any of the "runtime errors" such as:

/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RcppArmadillo/include/current/armadillo_bits/Mat_meat.hpp:7043:26:
runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'const double'

Dirk, could you please share the exact R or Rscript command you ran to
obtain these errors? In addition, do I need to install fastTopics and the
other R packages in a specific way as well? That is, are there special
flags (perhaps existing somewhere in
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/README.txt) that are needed to
activate these extra debugging checks?

Thanks again,
Peter

You want 'RD', not 'R'.  From the container's github repo README.mdL

   Note that the instrumented version of R is available on the path as
   Rdevel, symbolically linked as RD, and that the instrumented versions of
   Rscript is Rscriptdevel with symbolic link RDscript. Based on the R-devel
   sources, they use the sanitizer setup that is the focuse here whereas the
   R and Rscript binaries come from the standard binary package and
   correspond to R-release without any sanitizer instrumentation. So use RD
   and RDscript to inspect undefined behavior.

Also not sure why you added '-d valgrind'. That is a very fine tool, but its
use tends to be independent of ASAN/UBSAN and result in separate reports.

Best, Dirk

Hi,


The 'broadcast' package produces a NOTE on r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc (not on the other OS) regarding the BugReports URL on my Description file.

The NOTE (found here https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc/broadcast-00check.html) says:
"The BugReports field in DESCRIPTION has https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/ which should likely be https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/issues instead."

I tried the suggested URL given by CRAN (https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/issues) but it re-directs me to https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/created_by/issues, which is not what I intended.

The URL I placed on the DESCRIPTION file myself (https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/) works correctly for me. It works on multiple different web browsers. It works whether I'm logged in on GitHub or not. It works also when I clear all my cookies on my browser. It works on browsers I've never used before. And it works - according to CRAN's own checks - on all other OS configurations.

I know CRAN checks URLs differently, but it is weird that this NOTE is only produced for r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, and not the other OS configurations.

Is this a mistake on my part, or a mistake on the part of CRAN?
If it is on my part, what did I do wrong?
If it is a mistake on the part of CRAN, I would like to kindly to ask them to correct whatever happened on their side.


Kind regards,

Tony

I tried the suggested URL given by CRAN (https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/issues) but it re-directs me to https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/created_by/issues, which is not what I intended.

The URL I placed on the DESCRIPTION file myself (https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast/issues/) works correctly for me. It works on multiple different web browsers. It works whether I'm logged in on GitHub or not. It works also when I clear all my cookies on my browser. It works on browsers I've never used before. And it works - according to CRAN's own checks - on all other OS configurations.

I know CRAN checks URLs differently, but it is weird that this NOTE is only produced for r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, and not the other OS configurations.

Is this a mistake on my part, or a mistake on the part of CRAN?
If it is on my part, what did I do wrong?
If it is a mistake on the part of CRAN, I would like to kindly to ask them to correct whatever happened on their side.


Kind regards,

Tony

Hello together,

I have a question regarding the Authors at R field.
When I run R CMD check . in a package either created by myself with
pkgKitten::kitten, usethis::create_package or even on existing packages on
Cran (e.g. the validate package),
I get the following error:

* checking for file ?./DESCRIPTION? ... ERROR
Required fields missing or empty:
  ?Author? ?Maintainer?
* DONE

The corresponding line in the DESCRIPTION file is:

Authors at R: person("Your", "Name", role = c("aut", "cre"),
       email = "your at email.com")

and Authors at R:
    person("First", "Last", , "first.last at example.com", role = c("aut",
"cre"))

for pkgKitten and usethis respectively.

Why does this error occur?

With best wishes
Julian

You haven't built the package.  Some checks only succeed on a built copy 
of a package, i.e. the *.tar.gz file.  The devtools::check() function 
will do both the build and test.

Part of building the package modifies the DESCRIPTION file to insert the 
Author and Maintainer fields.  Another important difference is that 
.Rbuildignore is processed, so you won't get warnings about files that 
shouldn't be there, or false success if you accidentally specify 
ignoring a file that should be kept.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN macOS arm status problem?
Message-ID: <2E5FDFD2-E37C-4134-815A-B11F1DC689FE@mac.com>

Is there an issue with the macOS arm binary builder for CRAN? Searching through the archives, I found a message (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2023q2/009192.html) that included a link to https://mac.r-project.org/reports/status.html.

The status page shows that x86 packages were last updated today (2025-11-18), but arm packages were last updated on 11-13 and 11-14. I?ve noticed that a number of recently updated binary packages are available for x86 but not arm.

Also, is there a preferred way to report or inquire about build status (other than ask here)?

Thanks,
John

So to be super explicit, the thing you need to do on the command line to
check a package fully is
  R CMD build packageDirectory
  R CMD check packageDirectory_x.y.z.tar.gz
ie. always run it on a source tarball. You can run R CMD check directly on
packageDirectory, but it is not the same

Encapsulated in a Makefile, it looks something like this

base_minfi: minfi
ifneq (,$(wildcard minfi/DESCRIPTION))
minfi_VERSION:=$(shell grep ^Version minfi/DESCRIPTION | sed 's_Version:
__')
endif

Sorry, pressed send too soon

base_minfi: minfi
     ifneq (,$(wildcard minfi/DESCRIPTION))
       minfi_VERSION:=$(shell grep ^Version minfi/DESCRIPTION | sed
's_Version: __')
      endif

build_minfi: base_minfi
        rm -Rf minfi/inst/doc
        R CMD build  minfi

check_minfi: build_minfi
        R CMD check minfi_$(minfi_VERSION).tar.gz

(minfi being a package name). Makefiles need TABs and I am pretty sure some
of these might be messed up by copy and paste, so you need to fix that. I
tend to add --no-build-vignettes to the R CMD build call, to speed things
up.

Hi all,

After submitting a package, I get errors for two specific CRAN checks (both MacOS ARM64 machines) where the install log (see below) tells me that the compiler cannot find 'stdio.h' and 'assert.h'. I've never had this issue before, and the package builds fine on the other CRAN machines (including the other MacOS machines). I suspect that there is an issue with these particular CRAN machines. Or am I missing something?

This is the problematic install log:

Pepijn,

this was a temporary failure due to an SSD dying in the arm64 build machine (the error means the SDK is not present) which has been fixed so whenever new results are synced it will go away. Please use R-SIG-Mac to report any Mac-related issues.

Cheers,
Simon

Never mind. The error has suddenly disappeared. So, I guess it was a temporary issue with the CRAN machine.

Yes, one of the SSDs in the arm64 build machine died while I was traveling in Australia for the R dev day. I was able to setup a new build VM on another machine remotely and things should be back to normal, but if you still see any issues, let me know.

The most preferred way to is email me, but you can also email R-SIG-Mac which is more appropriate than this list (which is for package development).

Hi Simon,

Thanks for resetting the box after the SSD fail.

It looks like something is still amiss on oldrel-macos-arm64:

  ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/opt/gfortran/lib/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin20.0/12.2.0'
  ld: library not found for -lgfortran
  clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

It is talking about both version 14.0.*

  using C++ compiler: ?Apple clang version 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)?

yet looking for 12.0.* Fortran:

  -L/opt/gfortran/lib/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin20.0/12.2.0
  
That is from the RcppArmadillo update yesterday:

  https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-oldrel-macos-arm64/RcppArmadillo-00install.html

Posting here as it is a CRAN infrastructure issue, not a question that is
macOS specific (and as a non-macOS user I have no subscription to r-sig-mac).

Thanks in advance for taking care of this, Dirk

Dirk,

thanks, you're right - I forgot that oldrel still uses the older Fortran. I have added the Fortran switching according to the R version, so it should work now.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] UTF-8 and raw strings in package code
Message-ID: <990f723d-de12-4bbc-80a2-f13439e8912b@app.fastmail.com>

Hi--- My package 'lyxport' has R code with several raw strings (see ?Quotes) which contain UTF-8 characters (FWIW: in order to deal with wacky legacy Latex characters). For example, one of the strings is:

  converto <- r"--{
      ?   \"A ?   \"a ?   \'A ?   \'a ?   \.A ?   \.a ?   \=A
      ?   \=a ?   \^A ?   \^a ?   \`A ?   \`a ?   \k{A} ?   \k{a}
<snipped>
      ?   {\NG} ?   {\O}  ?   {\o}  ?   {\oe} ?   {\OE} ?   {\ss} ?   {\th}
      ?   {\TH}
    }--"

RCMD CHECK is not happy, and gives a Warning:

"Portable packages must use only ASCII characters in their R code and NAMESPACE directives, except perhaps in comments. Use \uxxxx escapes for other characters."

and indeed that is as stated in "Writing R extensions", section 1.1.5 ("Package subdirectories") and section 1.6.3, "Encoding issues".

But I wonder if this is still sensible now that

(i) R has raw strings (since ~R 4.0);
(ii) the DESCRIPTION file explicitly says "Encoding: UTF-8"; and 
(iii) R >= 4.2 pretty much now enforces UTF-8 in Windows (and UTF-8 could even be a "requirement" of this package, if that helped).

With "normal" strings then maybe the \uxxxx thing is reasonable; but shouldn't the contents of raw strings be exempt? You can't put \uxxxx into a raw string, for obvious reasons...

cheers
Mark


PS Of course, there are ways around the Warning (eg storing the strings as files elsewhere in the package, and reading those files during the code) but they are tedious, harder to maintain, and reduce clarity (imagine using \uxxxx in the above!). Since I don't particularly care whether the package goes on CRAN or not (it's living quite happily in R-universe), I've no plans to change my code, but I would prefer to avoid Warnings that then have to be explained to would-be users. And I am probably not the only person affected.

PPS The package has been working fine on Windows, Macs, and Linux.

Wouldn't the obvious thing be to not use an r string here? Using r strings does not imply the use of non-ascii characters (AFAIK they are intended for regex patterns), and using regular strings does not imply you cannot use Unicode (with \uxxxx).

At some point I would think that accepting Unicode in package source code would become acceptable... but supporting Unicode in data objects does not implicitly suggest that allowing Unicode in source code has to be supported so your arguments don't IMO really bring any weight to the discussion.

I'd prefer a change that said that R and NAMESPACE files must contain 
UTF-8, rather than an exception for raw strings.  ASCII is a subset, so 
any package that is currently compliant would still be compliant.

"Obvious" in terms of keeping RCMD CHECK happy, certainly, but it'd be antithetical to clear code--- the string I included in the post would become incomprehensible to the maintainer (me). 

IME raw strings in R are under-appreciated and little-known. They have lots of uses besides regexes, whatever the intention(s) may or may not have been! EG I use raw strings for formatted multi-line comments, and documentation, and  templated bits of text. Nicer code results.

Anyway, I'd be perfectly happy with Duncan Murdoch's suggestion of making UTF-8 legit in R & NAMESPACE generally. I suggested the minor incremental change of "only raw strings" (i) because that's the only thing that affects me ATM, and (ii) just in case there were unwelcome implications of UTF-8 for (iii) strings in general, or (iv) legal variable names etc.

Raw strings are very useful in a number of ways. That is why they were
added to R.

> Anyway, I'd be perfectly happy with Duncan Murdoch's suggestion of making UTF-8 legit in R & NAMESPACE generally. I suggested the minor incremental change of "only raw strings" (i) because that's the only thing that affects me ATM, and (ii) just in case there were unwelcome implications of UTF-8 for (iii) strings in general, or (iv) legal variable names etc.

Keeping the ASCII-only restriction for code is important as it makes
the code easier to understand by a wider audience.

Allowing non-ASCII characters in literal strings, raw or regular, does
seem reasonable to me in principle, but others may see issues I am not
aware of.

But checking for non-ASCII characters in code while allowing non-ASCII
characters in string literals needs much more sophisticated check code
than we currently have. If you or anyone else want to see this happen
you can explore creating a patch and submit to bugzilla for
consideration.

Best,

luke

Fair enough. It might be easier than you suspect, though, since the parser already does the heavy lifting--- code below.

(i) If the file doesn't even parse, that's a more serious problem! 

(ii) If the file does parse OK, then AFAICS the only places that non-ASCII characters might be lurking are: (a) in comments, where they are somewhat grudgingly allowed IIRC; (b) in string literals, where we would like to allow them;  and of course (c) in symbols (variable names; see notes below), where we DON'T want them if it's a package. And this can all be checked easily from $parseData. My specimen function below does it in ~20 lines of "real" code.

A couple of notes:

#1 I didn't realize that it is even possible to have a "normal" (ie non-backticked) variable name with non-ASCII letters (see ?Quotes, "Names and Identifiers"). And indeed I can run the following in my (Anglo) Windows RGUI:

fran?ais <- 'bon'

Crikey, that's actually scary... Anyway,  the intention is clearly to NOT allow that in package code, at least not yet.

#2 Should packages nevertheless be allowed to use backticked identifiers containing non-ASCII characters? (IME backticks are often used for funny names with all-ASCII characters but in the wrong places.) Personally I'd vote no, but it's well above my pay grade--- and there's no voting in R. Anyhow, my code below has an option to check/not-check backticked symbols.

Is this likely to be acceptable? If so I'll try to submit a formal patch.

cheers

## My function:

check_ASCII_code_MVB <- function( 
    file, pp= NULL, check_backticks= FALSE
){
  # Checks that any non-ASCII UTF-8 characters are confined to 
  # string-literals & comments
  
  # Can directly supply results of previous parse(), for speed
  if( is.null( pp)){ # ... or, if not:
    pp <- try( parse( file=file, keep.source=TRUE, encoding='UTF-8'))
    if( inherits( pp, 'try-error')){
      warning( "Can't even parse, let alone check for non-ASCII")
return( FALSE)
    }
  }
  
  # Get tokens of "leaf" (terminal) elements, and associated text
  # This mimicks utils::getParseData()
  ppd <- pp |> attr( 'wholeSrcref') |> attr( 'srcfile') |>
    _$parseData |> attributes() |> _[ c( 'tokens', 'text')]
  
  symbols <- with( ppd, 
      text[ grepl( 'SYMBOL', tokens, fixed=TRUE)])
    
  if( !check_backticks){
    # Not obvious whether to allow UTF-8 in backticked names
    
    # AFAICS backticks can only occur both at start and end of a parsable symbol
    backy <- startsWith( symbols, r"{`}") & endsWith( symbols, r"{`}")
    symbols <- symbols[ !backy]

  non_ASCII <- .Call( tools:::C_nonASCII, symbols)
  
  OK <- !any( non_ASCII)
  if( !OK){
    attr( OK, 'offending_symbols') <- unique( symbols[ non_ASCII])

}

Maybe scary, but part of the R idiom is that plots, etc get auto-labeled with the name of the variables. If I want to do a child-vs-parents' income chart in Danish, it becomes "b?rn" and "for?ldre". And such names can be column names in datasets, etc. You can work around it but why should you? 

So, for local usage, it is quite sensible to allow extended character sets. 

For packages (and other distributed materials) probably not so. It is probably the language and not actually the character set you want to restrict, though.

Message-ID: <CANAiAiXgv3pRHqs_OEYn_2qqfN1br48B1u-_pO9pszCB0ThozQ@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy Folks,

I got a message that a package I maintain (nlmixr2rpt) has errors. The
issue is that the underlying package I'm using (nlmixr2est) requires the qs
package. The qs package is being depreciated and replaced by qs2. The
developer of nlmixr2est is replacing this and it should be on CRAN and
fixed before my two week period.

So my question is if the underlying packages I depend on have been fixed
would I need to do anything on my end?

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_nlmixr2rpt.html

Thank you,
John

Depends how the changes affect the API. I might hazard that it would be fine, but really the only way you can know early is to track their version control repositories and test your package with their fix (maybe with their cooperation?).

Yeah I work closely with them. My question was more of: If their updated
package (nlmxir2extra) fixes the issues with my package (nlmixr2rpt) would
that fix be picked up by CRANs checks? Or would I need to do something else.

You still have to handle it in a way that is consistent with the rest
of the checking process, which I believe means catching the error and
returning FALSE. I would use tryCatch for that.

> (ii) If the file does parse OK, then AFAICS the only places that non-ASCII characters might be lurking are: (a) in comments, where they are somewhat grudgingly allowed IIRC; (b) in string literals, where we would like to allow them;  and of course (c) in symbols (variable names; see notes below), where we DON'T want them if it's a package. And this can all be checked easily from $parseData. My specimen function below does it in ~20 lines of "real" code.

It isn't quite right though: symbols can appear in a few other
places. Look at

     function(x = y) g(z = w)

I believe you are only picking up two of the five symbols you want.

Also you can simplify your code by using getParseData. I would also
avoid using the pipe operator since it isn't consistent with the
coding style in the file you are proposing to change.

(IME backticks are often used for funny names with all-ASCII characters but in the wrong places.) Personally I'd vote no, but it's well above my pay grade--- and there's no voting in R. Anyhow, my code below has an option to check/not-check backticked symbols.

It is worth putting together a clean and well-tested patch that can be
easily reviewed and tested by others. There are folks who spend much
more time than I do on the QC code and may see reasons why going down
this road is a bad idea, or how to do this better, but we'll see.

When I am trying to build a package, the system stops with request to run a function call, which, when executed, displays the same error message again. What would be an appropriate way to break that loop?

Have you tried to use the old safe way

  R CMD build <sourcedirectory>
  R CMD check <pkg>_<version>.tar.gz

it is more manual, i.e. slightly more tedious,  but considerably less error prone ..

You won't get that error if you follow Martin's advice and use `R CMD 
build pkg`, followed by `R CMD check pkg_x.tar.gz`, you'll probably get 
more informative messages.

 From the path reported below, it looks like you are using Windows, so 
my guess is that you do not have Rtools installed, or don't have it 
available to the check process (maybe the tools are not on your PATH).

See https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.5.html for 
lots of detail.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rcpp: cannot find R_ext/Callbacks.h under winbuilders
 R-devel
Message-ID: <00d601dc6538$2fb446f0$8f1cd4d0$@gmx.de>

Dear package developers and affiliated people,

 

I just noted a problem with an Rcpp-based package (cannot find
R_ext/Callbacks.h):

 

https://win-builder.r-project.org/S0C6dP4J5NLU/00install.out

 

I admit that I don't know if it is a problem in Rcpp, R-devel or in the Rcpp
example from RStudio.

 

To reproduce in RStudio, just 

 

1.	create a new Rcpp sample, 
2.	change the email in DESCRIPTION into something meaningful (I forgot
that part when I tried it first)
3.	submit to r-devel (!) on CRAN's winbuilder

 

I appreciate any guidance on this (since my own package shows the same
error).

 

Best wishes,

 

Matthias

This is due to recent changes in R-devel that effect Rcpp. It seems I?aki/Dirk have it in hand over there (https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/pull/1418)

TL;DR, this has been _fixed_. You can resubmit your package. Longer
explanation follows.

In the process of header cleanup that R Core has been addressing
lately, R_ext/Callbacks.h was dropped in R-devel [1], and packages
started to fail with the error you experienced, including all new
submissions linking to Rcpp. We are aware of that [2]. But it turns
out that this header has been restored for now [3], so packages won't
fail anymore.

It turns out that Rcpp introduced this include many many years ago,
and probably it was needed then looking at the ChangeLog, but it is
certainly not needed anymore, so we are removing it [4]. The next Rcpp
release is scheduled for January without this include, and then R Core
may safely remove it.

So thanks, Luke, for restoring it for now.

Many thanks for helpful hint. I?d be most grateful if you could direct me to a more appropriate info source. Duncan?s link was already helpful.

I installed R in version 4.5.2, renamed the directory for R version 4.3.3, edited the path from R in 4.3.3 to 4.5.2, did the same in the environment variable. rtools45 was installed in C: (a bit ugly IMO). When typing R <Ret> from git bash, R 4.5.2 would start. Typing R CMD check results in the error message: ?Die Syntax f?r den Dateinamen, Verzeichnisnamen oder die Datentr?gerbezeichnung ist falsch.? Running devtools::check() results in printing the outputs of various diagnostic checks, tallying the number of errors, warnings and notes at the end. Running devtools::dev_sitrep() from within the package yields the following output:

?? R ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
? version: 4.5.2
? path: 'C:/Program Files/R/R-4.5.2/'
?? Rtools ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
? path:
?? devtools ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
? version: 2.4.6
?? dev package ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
? package: 'staduicc'
? path: '//LKR-FILESRV/Epidemiologie/Materialien_Software/staduicc/'

Should I be worried that no path is returned for Rtools?

Thanks for the hint, but I use devtools::load_all only through dialogue with the cosole.

The R CMD check needs to include the package to check, e.g.

   R CMD check staduicc_0.3.1.tar.gz

(assuming the tar.gz file is in your current directory).

If you're getting errors, warnings and notes it sounds as though you 
have Rtools installed properly now.  The next step is to fix all the 
errors and warnings (and some of the notes).  If you need help with 
interpreting them, post them here.

Hi all, 

I?m getting a curious note from CRAN?s submission check I?m not sure how to resolve for the voluModel package:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE
Author field differs from that derived from Authors at R

I do not have an ?Author? field in the Description file, only the ?Authors at R? field. This is not an error I get from any of my pre-release checks. 
Does anyone have a suggestion regarding where this phantom ?Author? field is hiding?

With enough squinting we notice that the difference is (for all ORCID fieldsm
only one shown) between

   (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0071-1745>)

and 

   (ORCID: <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0071-1745>)

which leads to _suspect_ that the processing code is now ahead is makeing the
ORCID identificier more of a proper field (there have been previous changes
to that effect) and the checking code may not have caught up, but likely will
soon.

You could ask CRAN, or wait a day or two and see if it changes, and/or try
with a slightly older R-devel build.  My containers rocker/r-devel and
rocker/drd (which is slighly smaller) update weekly early in the week so you
could try that.

Cheers, Dirk

You probably get this message with a package built with a current version of R but checked against an older version of R which doesn't process the author at R field so smartly. If that is the case, it is ok.

With enough squinting we notice that the difference is (for all ORCID fieldsm
only one shown) between

   (<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0071-1745__;!!PDiH4ENfjr2_Jw!EKV33MV5OyGXwLgFFyy7S02IxiH0bYZ_3UYarHYrQBVfmhYkTnCKecjTtHmx8578yNVIlr3inlEbB72NlTDHKv7c$ [orcid[.]org]>)

and

which leads to _suspect_ that the processing code is now ahead is makeing the
ORCID identificier more of a proper field (there have been previous changes
to that effect) and the checking code may not have caught up, but likely will
soon.

You could ask CRAN, or wait a day or two and see if it changes, and/or try
with a slightly older R-devel build.  My containers rocker/r-devel and
rocker/drd (which is slighly smaller) update weekly early in the week so you
could try that.

Thanks, that's helpful. I'll tidy up and submit the patch and que sera, sera.

FWIW my code does already trap parse-errors, and in fact it will check all 5 "symboloids" in your snippet      function(x = y) g(z = w) . The $parseData reports SYMBOL, SYMBOL_SUB, SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL, SYMBOL_FORMALS for the different cases, which are all caught by grepl().

I initially did use getParseData() but then realized it wasn't adding anything (except time). Anyway, I'll leave both options in there, de-piped, for people to consider.

cheers
Mark

(IME backticks are often used for funny names with all-ASCII characters but in the wrong places.) Personally I'd vote no, but it's well above my pay grade--- and there's no voting in R. Anyhow, my code below has an option to check/not-check backticked symbols.

So far I managed to whittle it down zo 1 error, 2 warnings, and 3 notes.

Topics I may welcome some feedback on:

* R CMD check does not run from the command line (R does), this is not a biggie though, as R CMD check seems to be run as part of devtools::check()

* "Checking for future timestamps" comes to a pause until a clock server is found but rejected for a lack of https protocol

* How do "Writing R Extensions" and R-pkgs.org relate? Seems to me the main difference is the reliance of r-pkgs.org on the usethis package. Speaking of this, does a usethis:: function exist which runs @examples in isolation from he other checks? The editor fails checking for matched brackets and stuff, so the example is the main debugging chore as I cannot seem to run examples without devtools::checking the rest.

* On a related note: browser() seems to be unavailable during running examples, correct?

*  As part of debtools::load_all() I get the Warning: replacing previous import 'dbplyr::sql' by 'dplyr::sql' when loading 'staduicc'. I did not invoke sql(). What am I to infer from this message?

Thank you very much

Perhaps you are not building the package first, and then checking the 
built result?

If your package is named staduicc and you are working on version 1.0.0, 
there would be two steps.  The first step is

   R CMD build <path to>/staduicc

This produces staduicc_1.0.0.tar.gz .  The second step is

   R CMD check staduicc_1.0.0.tar.gz

This does the check.  The devtools::check() function does both of these 
steps.


> * "Checking for future timestamps" comes to a pause until a clock server is found but rejected for a lack of https protocol

I haven't seen that particular issue.  I think you probably just need to 
ignore it.
> * How do "Writing R Extensions" and R-pkgs.org relate? Seems to me the main difference is the reliance of r-pkgs.org on the usethis package. 

Writing R Extensions is the "official" documentation, written by the R 
Core group.  R-pkgs.org is a web site based on Hadley Wickham's book 
about R.  Hadley is not in R Core, but he has a lot of experience 
building packages, and works at Posit, a company that started building 
addons for R, and has now branched out.  He was the principal author of 
the devtools package.  usethis is another one of Posit's packages.  Its 
goal is to simplify the tasks that are required to work with R.

 >Speaking of this, does a usethis:: function exist which runs @examples 
in isolation from he other checks? The editor fails checking for matched 
brackets and stuff, so the example is the main debugging chore as I 
cannot seem to run examples without devtools::checking the rest.

You can check examples one at a time in an R session by running

   example( topic )

I don't know if there's an easy way to run all the examples but not run 
the rest of the checks.  I just run them all.
> * On a related note: browser() seems to be unavailable during running examples, correct?

Generally browser() will only work in an interactive session.  So if you 
had a call to browser() in an example, it would run when you used 
example(topic), but not when you used R CMD check.>

I never use load_all(), so I can't really tell you anything specific 
about it.  My understanding is that it sort of fakes the process of 
building and installing a package.  I just build and install packages 
when I want to test them, in the belief that the time saved by 
load_all() comes with the risk that the fakery isn't perfect, and will 
waste lots of time when the real behaviour doesn't match the load_all() 
behaviour.

Sorry, I was thinking of a different book.  The R-pkgs.org book is by 
Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan.  Jennifer is the principal author of 
usethis, which likely explains the emphasis on that package.

Your package seems to import an `sql` function twice, once from dbplyr and once from dplyr. This looks like you are too generous in your NAMESPACE file. You should use `importFrom` and avoid importing all functions from other package namespaces.

Many thanks.
Removing the @example section from the *.R file helped insofar as the diagnostic messages do not contain any errors any more.

However, I would like to have an example spelt out upon request. I therefore added a vignette by invoking usethis::use_vignette("staduicc"). Entering and testing the Rmd file worked like a charm. Regrettably, devtools::check() stops with the message "System command 'Rcmd.exe' failed". I tried to work through the suggestions in https://forum.posit.co/t/failed-to-install-package-from-github-rcmd-exe-failed/166390 but to no avail.

As an aside:

My understanding that it is more or less a source() on all the *.R files in ./R, only that the source is evaluated in the environment bound to the package instead of <environment: R_globalenv>. I find this desirable.

You are right and I stand corrected. According to https://devtools.r-lib.org/, it does what you say it does (only that it reads "simulates" instead of "sort of fakes".

I don't even need dbplyr. This was a leftover. After editing dbplyr from DESCRIPTION and running devtools::document(), devtools::check() complains about contradictory entries in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE. According to  https://devtools.r-lib.org/, devtools::document() can be used to update NAMESPACE. This did not work here, NAMESPACE was not touched by devtools::document().

I think Roxygen (called by devtools::document()) will not modify a file 
that you wrote yourself.  You should move it out of your package and let 
Roxygen create it.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Resubmitting Archived Packages
Message-ID: <BL0PR07MB54918D170A41577CAC9EC4CA80A1A@BL0PR07MB5491.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hello all,

I was looking for advice on best practices for resubmitting packages that were archived. 

This morning, Brian Ripley erroneously archived one of my packages (geomander) prior to the deadline to fix a broken example. He then archived its reverse dependencies a few minutes later.

Given that CRAN is closing for the winter soon, I would like to fix this issue quickly. I have already resubmitted geomander this morning, as I had originally planned. However, as the packages are archived, each now must undergo a manual review, which takes more time.

Is it acceptable to submit the other downstream packages while the first is awaiting manual checks, as long as they are submitted in order of the dependency tree? As the original package had only a broken example and the reverse dependencies were actively passing checks, the review should be simple.

I would appreciate any advice or wisdom on how to reupload them expeditiously.

Best,
Chris

As far as I know that is not generally the case. I have seen packages
re-appear within hours of being archived. I am not aware of a policy
statement either way.

You will need a new revision (that question did come up recently and was
answered). But the incoming queue and its operators know the package has been
on CRAN and seem to give it expedited treatment no different from a normal
upload.  Of course NOTEs and WARNINGs and other outstanding issues need to be
addressed. 

[ I am speaking as a 'neutral observer' here as I am not involved in CRAN
operations. I merely wrote and continue to run some services that watch or
consume it such as CRANberries, r2u, or the CRAN Policy Watch. ]

Why erroneously?  Your deadline passed.
A new deadline was set for the reverse dependencies, but as mail to the 
maintainer bounced, that new deadline was not needed as the reverse 
dependencies got archived for themselves as they are unmaintained.

Please submit geomander and get it accepted first. The others will be 
auto-archived otherwise.

Thank you both for your responses.

The deadline had not passed at the time the package was removed. It was before the deadline at every single point on Earth. He removed the package early. It?s an error, plain and simple.

I'm happy to share the email with the deadline if that would help.

Thank you also for reviewing the update to geomander. 

(On the point of manual review, the package goes to newbies, but based on the speed of the response, it may not take an entire human review in the same way as other packages.)

Best,
Chris

Why erroneously? Your deadline passed.
A new deadline was set for the reverse dependencies, but as mail to the
maintainer bounced, that new deadline was not needed as the reverse
dependencies got archived for themselves as they are unmaintained.

Please submit geomander and get it accepted first. The others will be
auto-archived otherwise.

Thanks to your helpful hints (and Roland's) I could eliminate the warning about multiple definitions of sql(). When I remove the vignettes directory, I am left with two notes and to warnings which I am happy to ignore. Two warnings about using non-ASCII characters in comments, one note about "no visible binding for global variable" and one about a time server which would not be found.

Many thanks for all helpful advice!

Dear all,

I'm going to transfer the pim package on CRAN to a new maintainer, but I'm not entirely certain how I'd go about this best. Do I submit the package with the updated DESCRIPTION file, or can they do that? Is there any other instance I need to inform in another way?

Dear Joris,

I would suggest that you change the maintainer in DESCRIPTION and describe
the change in cran-comments.md in the package root. When the new maintainer
submits a new version to CRAN, you will get an email asking you to confirm
the change. At least that's what I recall when changing the maintainer
email address in a package.

Best regards,

Thierry

The new maintainers submits a new version (increased version number, 
updated maintainer information in the DESCRIPTION file).
You (/the old maintainer) will be automatically asked to confirm the 
submission once the update passes incoming checks.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

   I hesitate to prolong this part of the conversation, but ...

   ... when CRAN says "issues need fixing before [DATE]" (e.g. see 
https://hadley.github.io/cran-deadlines/), is that technically "on or 
before" or "strictly before"?  Without worrying about time zones at the 
moment, if my deadline is 2026-01-01 and I upload a new version of my 
package sometime on 2026-01-01, am I OK?  Or do I need to have uploaded 
a version on the previous day?

   cheers

Hi Ben,

We're talking mainly about statisticians here, who tend to be sticklers 
for precision. So, I would interpret "before" as meaning "less than" and 
not "less than or equal". But this is not a definitive answer, of course 
(he says, stickling).

Best,
 ? ?Kevin

"Before" is meant as "<".

In the past we had communication issues as is was not obvious for 
everybody that British English speakers use "by" in the sense of "<".
I believed "before" was clear enough, but maybe we have to use a 
mathematical expression?

Uwe Ligges

As a native speaker of the dialect spoken in the south east of England I 
find "before" much clearer. Before Sunday means not later than Saturday 
to me. I find "by" less clear, by Sunday could mean before Monday.

My 2?: if precision is required, use a timestamp, including time zone. It's
only a few character more.

Alternatively, something like 'before YYYY-MM-DD (N days, m hours)'.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Looking for maintainer of symmoments package
Message-ID: <00c201dc6ba6$0d79edf0$286dc9d0$@comcast.net>

Dear R community,

 

I'm the author and current maintainer of the "symmoments" package. This
package computes the central and non-central moments of the multivariate
normal distribution. In doing this it computes the formula for the requested
moment, both printable in Latex and internally in a format that is used for
actual computations and that can be used over, not requiring that it be
recalculated.

 

Since I'm retired and have not been seriously programming in a few years, it
is becoming difficult for me to maintain it, so I'm hoping someone could
take it over. Note that the package has been downloaded over 86,000 times
and there is at least one package that requires it. There have been no
serious problems with it, only minor changes apparently due to changes in
other packages.

 

If you would be interested in taking this over, I would greatly appreciate
it. Let me know here or at my email address: kemphillipsk at comcast.net
<mailto:kemphillipsk at comcast.net> . 

 

Thanks.
