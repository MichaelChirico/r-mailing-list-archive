Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R package does not find DLL routine
In-Reply-To: <20200628233953.1615607b@trisector>

Dear Dirk, dear Ivan,

thanks for your suggestions. I agree that R packages aren't meant to be
build that way, and even though this is an academic project but since the
source code wasn't written by me it is not my decision if, where and when
to publish it openly. In any case, directly linking to a DLL seems quite
unstable and I just came across the option to do a system call to an
executable instead which appears to maybe be the most straight forward
solution for me.

Thanks a lot for your time and effort.
Best,
Lisa

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] check cross-references error: Non-file
 package-anchored link(s)
Message-ID: <trinity-3569f1e7-da91-4b3c-9930-c4b451c9cb92-1593625573460@3c-app-webde-bap32>

Good evening,

My package bit 4.0.2 (https://github.com/truecluster/bit) is being 
rejected by CRAN checks with warning:


 >Check: Rd cross-references, Result: WARNING
 >  Non-file package-anchored link(s) in documentation object 'clone.Rd':
 >    '[ff]{clone.ff}'
 >
 >  See section 'Cross-references' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

although clone.ff is in clone.ff.rd as confirmed by

 > help("clone.ff","ff")[[1]]
[1] "/home/mypc/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/ff/help/clone.ff"

I asked the maintainers to explain what is wrong and what to do and got 
no answer. Does someone here can help?

Best regards

Jens

Linking to the manual _file_ is now enforced on CRAN. Here is how to
get the file name:

> help("clone.ff", package = "ff")[[1]]
[1] "/Users/gaborcsardi/Library/R/4.0/library/ff/help/clone"

So in this case you need to link to 'clone'.

Btw. since you already use roxygen2, you could also turn on markdown
support, and then [ff::clone.ff()] automatically creates the right
links in the latest version of roxygen2.

It's actually in ff/man/clone.rd, not clone.ff.rd.  There is no 
ff/man/clone.ff.rd file.

Hi,
What is the recommended way to test for those issues locally?
If it is tested during cran submission, then seems reasonable to be enabled
just by --as-cran switch. Is it?
Thanks

You can set the _R_CHECK_XREFS_MIND_SUSPECT_ANCHORS_=true env var and
use R-devel.

Alternatively, and you don't need R-devel for this, you can run R CMD
--html INSTALL on your package, and then look for messages that
contain "treated as a topic", e.g.

    curl_fds                                html
Rd warning: /Users/gaborcsardi/works/processx/man/curl_fds.Rd:11: file
link ?multi_fdset? in package ?curl? does not exist and so has been
treated as a topic

Thanks Gabor and Duncan,

but there *is* clone.ff.rd in the >= 4.0.0 versions of the packages bit/bit64/ff.

Hence the check warning is a false alarm resulting from checking bit 4.0.2 (GitHub.com/truecluster) against ff 2.2-14.2 (CRAN) instead of checking it against the also submitted ff 4.0.2 (GitHub.com/truecluster).

So all I can and will do is waiting that CRAN maintainers install and check again.

Best

Jens

Yes, this is one consequence of the newly enforced check. Now you can
choose which version of the ff package you want to be compatible with.
In the GH version a manual file was renamed and this is now a breaking
change, so you cannot be compatible with both.

There are a few ways to deal with this, but waiting for ff to be updated 
is probably easiest.

However, maybe ff can't be updated until bit is updated.  Here are some 
possibilities:

One way is to make bit depend on a particular version of ff.  That may 
cause a deadlock if both are being updated at once, but I think CRAN 
should be able to deal with it if they are informed of the issue.

Another way is to use R code in the Rd file to select which link to use. 
  For example, instead of \link[ff]{clone.ff}, you could use

\Sexpr[results=rd,stage=render]{clonelink()}

where clonelink() is a function that generates either 
"\link[ff]{clone.ff}" or "\link[ff:clone]{clone.ff}" depending on the 
detected installed version of ff.

Another choice that is nearly as easy as doing nothing is to include no 
link at all in this update, and make it a link again in the next update 
when the new ff is available.

Exactly that I have done: I submitted all three packages bit/bit64/ff in version 4.0.2 and made them dependend on Version >= 4.0.0.
And yes, the maintainers have been informed about the issue.

I'm not sure that's what I meant, but I can't be sure, since I haven't 
seen your source.  What I meant is a package dependency, i.e. the 
existing ff on CRAN is version 2.2-14.2 and it depends on bit without 
saying what version of bit is needed.  The existing bit is 1.1-15.2 with 
no dependency on ff.

So you can force the new ff to use the new bit by giving the version 
number, e.g.

Depends:  bit (>= 2.0)

but it's not so obvious how to make the new bit depend on the new ff.
There's no way to say that the dependency is only to a help page, and 
circular strong dependencies are messy, so I'd suggest you use one of 
the other options I offered:  a dynamic link in the Rd file, or no link 
at all.

Thank you for the advice Duncan,

But let's not get carried away here: we are talking about a *warning* that only arises if two packages are checked together that are never meant to be installed together.
The new packages contain weeks of improvement-work, and I am not going to add back-and-forth-trick-work just to circumvent some warnings that arise only at the point of switching from old to new.

If there is a problem when checking the new packages together that's a different story and worth taking care about. I didn't find such problems.

Kind regards


Jens

That's a choice, but your package might face auto-rejection on CRAN. 
Asking CRAN to handle your update manually means extra work for them; if 
there's a simple way to handle it without that (and I've given you two 
to choose from), it seems kind of selfish not to use it.

BTW, assuming you got the two packages on CRAN, it wouldn't be hard for 
a user to install the new bit without updating ff:  just have both 
installed before your update, then ask to update bit.  Since it doesn't 
depend on ff, it won't trigger an ff update.  You can't expect R to know 
they were never meant to be installed together unless you record that 
fact in the dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file.

On Linux you can use 'ltrace' to get a list of all the environment
variables that R looks up.  E.g., do the following in 'script' so all the
output is stored in a file ('typescript') and later look around in it for
the getenv calls.

$ R-devel --debugger=ltrace --debugger-args="-f -e getenv"

Hello everyone,

I would like to include external java codes (.jar files) to a package in order to speed up some computations.
However, this would increase the package size above 5 Mb and this code would not be working for users without java installation. 

Instead, I could include a default parameter in the function calling another R package making the same computation but more slowly. It would be best for users without java on their computer.
Besides, I could allow users to download the external java code from a stable url, and include in the R function all the arguments to launch this java code (wrapper for the java code). When downloaded, the jar file should be copied directly into the extdata directory in the user computer if possible.

Does it seem feasible to you? 

Many thanks 
Regards
Paul

Please check out the recent thread "Proper CRAN way - How to handle dependency of java jar file?? About a week ago - I asked essentially the same questions.

Cheers,

Pleas keep the list in CC so that they know tat you have a solution. Thanks.

There is the function ?Sys.which()? which returns the full path to an executable. Although in many cases correct, it can be that Java is installed but not in the path. So I have a variable called ?java.path? which is used when java is called - the default is set to `java.path <- Sys.which("java?)`

Plesase see https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml/blob/dev/R/aaa.R <https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml/blob/dev/R/aaa.R> and https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml/blob/dev/R/options.R <https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml/blob/dev/R/options.R> how I implemented it.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Debugging Clang ASAN errors
Message-ID: <CANotEPucEjpDT+1rJwmQBU3G_Nz9JQDopPwmynqOdtP3WtEmaA@mail.gmail.com>

A package I recently had accepted to CRAN is throwing up a "memory not
mapped" segfault on CRAN's post-acceptance fedora-clang ASAN test.  This
error does not occur with debian-clang or gcc.
(Check results:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_TBRDist.html)

I found a similar issue in the r-packages archives (
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2018q3/002907.html). The
suggestion in that case was that the issue may have been a false positive,
a possibility that is consistent with a "HINT" in the output log.

I optimistically suspect that this is the case here too: my package is an R
wrapper to a mature C library, and the segmentation fault arises during a
routine operation with simple input, not in some obscure corner case.  So
question one is: how might I confirm that this is indeed a false positive?

If it's not a false positive, then this raises the question of how I might
reproduce it, as a Windows user without access to a machine running Fedora.
rhub::check_with_sanitizers() uses debian, and returns 'success':
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/TBRDist_1.0.0.9000.tar.gz-b965d74e18dd4bdc8e51e4254ee3699a
Rocker (https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) only offers a debian (not
fedora) environment, so looks like it will not reproduce the error.

Any thoughts would be gratefully received!

Thanks,

Martin

The error points to this spot:
https://github.com/ms609/uspr-r/blob/04ecc6f6d26d7db957dc7da2d7753e0cec040a92/tbr.h#L2973

If I'm reading this correctly, if the match happens at the beginning
of the loop, then this is decrementing an iterator to
sibling_pairs.begin(), which doesn't sound good. This can't really
have an impact, because there's a break afterwards, but the library
shouldn't be doing that anyway.

Has the discussion about potential updates to Rd2HTML come to an end?
Should I be prepared to fix non-file package-anchored links in
(non-roxygen) packages I maintain, i.e., look up the help file structure
of the referenced packages?

I don't yet believe that R has really given up on supporting
developer-friendly, direct and simple links to

             _topic_       rather than            _file_

\link[rgeos]{gIntersection}     -> \link[rgeos]{topo-bin-gIntersection}

\link[colorspace]{heat_hcl}     -> \link[colorspace]{rainbow_hcl}

\link[RColorBrewer]{brewer.pal} -> \link[RColorBrewer]{ColorBrewer}

\link[gridExtra]{grid.arrange}  -> link[gridExtra]{arrangeGrob}

\link[ggplot2]{geom_line}       -> \link[ggplot2]{geom_path}

for pointing to other packages which are only in Suggests and thus not
necessarily installed at install-time of the referencing package.

Topic-based links to external functions are so much more intuitive. I do
not understand why there should be a penalty for clearly identifying the
target package as opposed to just writing \link{topic} and hoping that
the intended package will be found by the help system at run time.

Dear all,

The problem:
I struggle to solve a WARNING that is shown on the CRAN system but not on my side when I use "R-devel check --as-cran IndependenceTests". This seems to be related to the declaration of a LAPACK Fortran subroutine (zhpevx) that I call from C.

I could not find any hint on Google allowing me to solve the issue. I read the following sections of the "Writing R Extensions" manual (but could not understand how to solve the problem):

  *   4.5 Using Link Time Optimization
  *   6.6 Calling C from Fortran and vice versa

Maybe the solution is obvious, but not to me.

The warning shown on CRAN is:
checking whether package ?IndependenceTests? can be installed ...
[11s/11s] WARNING
Found the following significant warnings:
    myzhpevx.cpp:13:23: warning: type of ?zhpevx_? does not match original declaration [-Wlto-type-mismatch]

Other feedback I received from the CRAN team:
Professor Brian Ripley suggested the two pieces of advice below (which I believe to have followed):

  *   For registering/interfacing Fortran calls,
       gfortran -c -fc-prototypes-external
is the best way to extract a prototype (with gfortran >= 9.2).  If this
includes int_least32_t, see the comment below on Fortran-LOGICAL.
hint).
  *
 Fortran subroutines correspond to C void functions

What is the current state of my source code:
I have a Fortran subroutine (defined in the file src/zhpevx.f at line 232):
      SUBROUTINE zhpevx( JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, AP, VL, VU, IL, IU,
     $     abstol, m, w, z, ldz, work, rwork, iwork,
     $     ifail, info )

This subroutine is declared (in file myzhpevx.cpp at line 13) as follows:
          void F77_NAME(zhpevx)(char *jobz, char *range, char *uplo,
      const int *n, Rcomplex *ap, const double *vl,
      const double *vu, const int *il, const int *iu,
      const double *abstol, int *m, double *w,
      Rcomplex *z, const int *ldz, Rcomplex *work, double *rwork,
      int *iwork, int *ifail, int *info,
      FC_LEN_T jobz_len,  FC_LEN_T range_len,  FC_LEN_T uplo_len);

Source package can be downloaded here:

As shown below, it says "OK"

Please help me if you know how to fix the detritus issue in the temp dir.

Most likely this is because you start a web browser in your examples
or tests. Try to find where that happens, and don't run it that
example or test case on CRAN.

Thanks G?bor,

I removed all the URLs in the *.Rd files and resubmitted to CRAN.

I got the same NOTE again as below:

After removing the URLs in the *.Rd :
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rQCC_1.20.7_20200704_161730/Debian/00check.log


Just in case, the below is the NOTE before removing the ULRs in the Rd:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rQCC_1.20.7_20200702_112950/Debian/00check.log


I have this trouble after adding vignettes.
So my guess is that this NOTE may be from vignette.
I checked the package using  rhub::check_for_cran  with all the platforms.
They do not have this kind of issue.
Only CRAN produces this NOTE. My vignette is written in *.Rnw (essentially
the same as LaTeX format).
When the vignette file is compiled, some aux files are generated. So, I
think that CRAN may not delete aux files properly.

Thanks,
CP

URLs are fine, the problem is with opening external programs like a
web browser or a PDF viewer. I think you do that here:

https://github.com/AppliedStat/R/blob/8e4173da8917caf0f4f68d4056902075fb9013c2/rQCC/man/factors.cc.Rd#L118

Maybe at other places as well.

If you want to open the vignette from the example, maybe you can try
something like

if (interactive()) vignette("factors.cc", package="rQCC")

so it does not run in R CMD check.

I managed to reproduce the warning on R-devel r78607 built with
--enable-lto using gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1):

myzhpevx.cpp:13:16: warning: type of ?zhpevx_? does not match original declaration [-Wlto-type-mismatch]
           void F77_NAME(zhpevx)(char *jobz, char *range, char *uplo,

zhpevx.f:232:7: note: type mismatch in parameter 20
       SUBROUTINE zhpevx( JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, AP, VL, VU, IL, IU,
       ^
zhpevx.f:232:7: note: type ?int? should match type ?size_t?
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/include/stddef.h:216:23: note: the incompatible type is defined here
 typedef __SIZE_TYPE__ size_t;
                       ^
zhpevx.f:232:7: note: ?zhpevx? was previously declared here
       SUBROUTINE zhpevx( JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, AP, VL, VU, IL, IU,
       ^

Do you have access to the notes produced by the compiler in addition
to the warnings? Do they spell the same difference?

If yes, the warning is likely to be safe to ignore. m4/R.m4 notes that,
while gfortran < 8 uses int instead of size_t for hidden size arguments,
it doesn't make a practical difference.

Dear Ivan,

Thank you very much for your response.

I do not have more information than the one I gave in my previous email. (And on top of that, the computer I was using with Debian SID, a recent version of gfortran and the last version of R-devel, just broke.)

My problem is that the CRAN team won't accept to publish my package until this WARNING problem is solved. And because I am unable to observe the warning on my side (I could not with the desktop that just broke, and I still can't with my current laptop with Debian 10), I have no clue on how to suppress this warning.

Thank you in advance for any other advice.

Best regards,
Pierre

I managed to reproduce the warning on R-devel r78607 built with
--enable-lto using gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1):

myzhpevx.cpp:13:16: warning: type of ?zhpevx_? does not match original declaration [-Wlto-type-mismatch]
           void F77_NAME(zhpevx)(char *jobz, char *range, char *uplo,

       SUBROUTINE zhpevx( JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, AP, VL, VU, IL, IU,
       ^

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/include/stddef.h:216:23: note: the incompatible type is defined here

       ^

Do you have access to the notes produced by the compiler in addition
to the warnings? Do they spell the same difference?

If yes, the warning is likely to be safe to ignore. m4/R.m4 notes that,
while gfortran < 8 uses int instead of size_t for hidden size arguments,
it doesn't make a practical difference.

Have you tried what is recommended in
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Argument-passing-conventions.html
?

<quote>
For arguments of CHARACTER type, the character length is passed as a
hidden argument at the end of the argument list. For deferred-length
strings, the value is passed by reference, otherwise by value. The
character length has the C type size_t (or INTEGER(kind=C_SIZE_T) in
Fortran). Note that this is different to older versions of the GNU
Fortran compiler, where the type of the hidden character length
argument was a C int. In order to retain compatibility with older
versions, one can e.g. for the following Fortran procedure

subroutine fstrlen (s, a)
   character(len=*) :: s
   integer :: a
   print*, len(s)
end subroutine fstrlen

define the corresponding C prototype as follows:

#if __GNUC__ > 7
typedef size_t fortran_charlen_t;
#else
typedef int fortran_charlen_t;
#endif

void fstrlen_ (char*, int*, fortran_charlen_t);

In order to avoid such compiler-specific details, for new code it is
instead recommended to use the ISO_C_BINDING feature.

Note with C binding, CHARACTER(len=1) result variables are returned
according to the platform ABI and no hidden length argument is used
for dummy arguments; with VALUE, those variables are passed by value.

Hello Bill,

Thank you for your insight.

First, my impression, is that the problem comes from how I declare the type of the function itself (and not its parameters), since the first (and only warning they seen on the CRAN) message is:

<quote>
myzhpevx.cpp:13:16: warning: type of ?zhpevx_? does not match original declaration [-Wlto-type-mismatch]
           void F77_NAME(zhpevx)(char *jobz, char *range, char *uplo,
</quote>

What I did is the following:

<quote>
void F77_NAME(zhpevx)(char *jobz, char *range, char *uplo,
      const int *n, Rcomplex *ap, const double *vl,
      const double *vu, const int *il, const int *iu,
      const double *abstol, int *m, double *w,
      Rcomplex *z, const int *ldz, Rcomplex *work, double *rwork,
      int *iwork, int *ifail, int *info,
      FC_LEN_T jobz_len,  FC_LEN_T range_len,  FC_LEN_T uplo_len);

 char cjobz[2];
 strncpy(cjobz, jobz[0], 1);
 cjobz[1] = '\0';
 char crange[2];
 strncpy(crange, range[0], 1);
 crange[1] = '\0';
 char cuplo[2];
 strncpy(cuplo, uplo[0], 1);
 cuplo[1] = '\0';

 F77_CALL(zhpevx)(cjobz, crange, cuplo, &n[0], ap, &vl[0], &vu[0], &il[0], &iu[0], &abstol[0], &m[0],
  w, z, &ldz[0], work, rwork, iwork, ifail, &info[0], strlen(cjobz), strlen(crange), strlen(cuplo));
</quote>

Do you see anything wrong with the above?

Thank you

Best
Pierre

My file myzhpevx.cpp starts with:

<quote>
#define USE_FC_LEN_T
#include <R.h>
#include "Rmath.h"

#ifdef FC_LEN_T
extern "C" {

  void zhpevxC(char **jobz, char **range, char **uplo, int *n, Rcomplex *ap,
     double *vl, double *vu, int *il, int *iu, double *abstol, int *m,
     double *w, Rcomplex *z, int *ldz, Rcomplex *work, double *rwork,
     int *iwork, int *ifail, int *info) {

          void F77_NAME(zhpevx)(char *jobz, char *range, char *uplo,
      const int *n, Rcomplex *ap, const double *vl,
      const double *vu, const int *il, const int *iu,
      const double *abstol, int *m, double *w,
      Rcomplex *z, const int *ldz, Rcomplex *work, double *rwork,
      int *iwork, int *ifail, int *info,
      FC_LEN_T jobz_len,  FC_LEN_T range_len,  FC_LEN_T uplo_len);
</quote>

So if I understand correctly what you are saying, you suggest that FC_LEN_T was not correctly defined by the CRAN team?

Should I just write something like (adding the middle instruction below to my existing code above)?:

<quote>
#ifdef FC_LEN_T
typedef long long int FC_LEN_T;
extern "C" {
</quote>

Thank you
Pierre

With gcc 8.3.0, gfortran 8.3.0, and ld 2.33.1 from the mingw64 part of
rtools40 on Windows, if I misdefine the typedef FC_LEN_T and use the
-flto flag I get the sort of error messages that you report.

extern void sub_(char* word, double *ret, FC_LEN_T word_len);

My recommendation would be to try to minimize the example (package) as 
much as possible so that it still has the problem, and then try to 
investigate why exactly/where is the type mismatch. This is what helped 
me debug similar issues - sometimes it was hard to tell from the Fortran 
warnings where exactly the mismatched declarations were and why they 
were mismatched.

This process of minimization can already reveal the true source of the 
problem, and if not, others may try to debug for you using the minimal 
example. A useful tool is the Fortran option -fc-prototypes-external 
(see WRE for more details) and I've also used dumps of the compiler tree 
before (-fdump-tree-all, more in GCC documentation).

Best
Tomas

No, I don't think that would help.

What _might_ help is adapting the incantation from [*] to redefine
FC_LEN_T to int on older GCC:

#if defined(__GNUC__) && __GNUC__ < 7
 /* Rconfig.h #define doesn't match the actual type
  * of hidden length argument in old gfortran */
 #define FC_LEN_T int
#else
 /* Otherwise we use the #define from Rconfig.h */
 #define USE_FC_LEN_T
#endif
/* Your code starts here */
#include <R.h>
/* ... */

Another option that _should_ help is rewriting zhpevxC in Fortran
2003 using its bind(c) feature. The C interoperability would ensure that
the resulting function is callable from C, while the fact that it's
written in Fortran should make it safe to call other Fortran functions:

subroutine zhpevxC(jobz, range, uplo, n, ap, vl, vu, il, iu, &
                   abstol, m, w, z, ldz, work, rwork, iwork, &
                   ifail, info) bind(c, name='zhpevxC')
 use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding, only: c_char, c_int, c_double, &
                                        c_double_complex

 character(kind = c_char) :: jobz, range, uplo
 integer(kind = c_int) :: il, info, iu, ldz, m, n
 real(kind = c_double) :: abstol, vl, vu
 integer(kind = c_int) :: ifail( * ), iwork( * )
 real(kind = c_double) :: rwork( * ), w( * )
 complex(kind = c_double_complex) :: ap( * ), work( * ), z( ldz, * )

 call zhpevx(JOBZ, RANGE, UPLO, N, AP, VL, VU, IL, IU, &
             abstol, m, w, z, ldz, work, rwork, iwork, &
             ifail, info)

end subroutine

A subroutine defined like this can be represented by the following C++
prototype: 

extern "C" void zhpevx(
	char * JOBZ, char * RANGE, char * UPLO, int * N,
	std::complex<double> * AP, double * VL, double * VU, int * IL,
	int * IU, double * abstol, int * m, double * w,
	std::complex<double> * z, int * ldz, std::complex<double> *
	work, double * rwork, int * iwork, int * ifail, int * info
);

This is the approach described in WRE 6.6.1 Fortran character strings
near the code block with the definition of subroutine c_dgemm.

Hi all,

Sorry for asking again, but I got absolutely no advice on how to
correctly refer to extra copyrights and authors files in package
DESCRIPTION.
I know this can be considered as impolite and I don't want to do so.
So, I waited one week until sending the present message and I promise I
will not send another to ask for the same thing after this one.

Best,
Yohann

Hi Yohann,

I had a similar situation with my first package.
I used Author + Maintainer field instead Authors at R and I added the
inst/AUTHORS to Author and my email to the Maintainer field.
In the list of author names (and I have a lot of them in cgal4h), make sure
that you also define the different roles (i.e ctb, cph, etc).
You can access the metadata here and the Gitlab repository there

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cgal4h

Hope it helps.

Ahmadou

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How do you Rd reference parallel::mclapply() so it

Message-ID: <CAFDcVCRNxFY1XPQ2OXv3Ymnc34vgQzYmm9cdf7Xp_=4LABXq6w@mail.gmail.com>

Here's another "Non-file package-anchored link(s) ..." issue.  I'd
like to reference parallel::mclapply() in my help pages.  With the new
R-devel requirements, you have to link to the file and not the topic.
However, there is no cross-platform stable file reference for
parallel::mclapply();

# According to R on Linux
> basename(help("mclapply", package="parallel"))
[1] "mclapply"

# According to R on Windows
> basename(help("mclapply", package="parallel"))
[1] "mcdummies"

How can I provide a \link{} reference to the help("mclapply",
package="parallel") documentation?

Thanks,

Henrik

Not nice, but you may follow the way described in subsection

Indeed, another example, why we should move away from the
'file' instead of 'topic' (<-> \alias{.}) paradigm and requirement.

I'm optimistic we will do that soonish ...

Thank you Ahmadou, Robert and G?bor,

In package 'presser'  G?bor used no dedicated AUTHORS file but use
'comment' and 'role' tag of Authors at R to mention their contribution and
refer to further comments in file (e.g.  inst/credits/redoc.md, src/md5.h)

Robert, also described a strategy using Authors at R

Ahmadou, used something similar to what I have done in the 'IFC' package I
want to submit on CRAN, with extra AUTHORS and COPYRIGHTS files found in
inst/ directory of its 'cgal4h' package. Then, he used "Author: file
inst/AUTHORS" and "Copyright: file inst/COPYRIGHTS" in DESCRIPTION file to
refer to these files.

In 'RcppMsgPack' package, I was using as an example in my 1st message,
extra AUTHORS and COPYRIGHTS files found in 'inst/' directory were also
used.
DESCRIPTION file contains:
- Author: Travers Ching and Dirk Eddelbuettel; the authors and contributors
of MsgPack
- Copyright: file inst/COPYRIGHTS

So, as far as I understand from your replies, there seems to be no general
rule on how to do it.
But it seems that when Author: or Copyright: is used in DESCRIPTION and
refer to a file then 'inst/' directory should be prepend to the file name
(e.g.  Copyright: file inst/COPYRIGHTS)

In next submission I will use in DESCRIPTION:
Authors at R and have a 'inst/AUTHORS' file
Copyright: file inst/COPYRIGHTS  and have a 'inst/COPYRIGHTS' file
Description: <the description of my 'IFC' package> + See file 'COPYRIGHTS'
and file 'AUTHORS' for a list of copyright holders and authors

Thanks a lot for your help,
Yohann

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] package installation and linking with JAGS
Message-ID: <CAK+wxiOXjMAd3CVfJMrT9Mh25EfrS7GbJfvhoJswa-xWZAWj6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

we have written an R package that uses JAGS and requires a JAGS module
that's distributed with the package. We had a lot of problems making
the installation work across platforms and we adapted the way it's done in
'runjags' (it also contains a JAGS module). However, we are having two
problems:

1) the CMD CHECK returns this warning
Check: for GNU extensions in Makefiles, Result: WARNING
  Found the following file(s) containing GNU extensions:
    src/Makevars
    src/Makevars.in
  Portable Makefiles do not use GNU extensions such as +=, :=, $(shell),
  $(wildcard), ifeq ... endif, .NOTPARALLEL See section 'Writing portable
  packages' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

2) the package installation works only from the source. For example,
devtools::install_github() returns an error since .o files are generated
inside of the package folder. A similar problem occurs when generating the
source .tar.gz, however, manually deleting the .o files from it fixes
the problem and it can be used for installing the package.

I wanted to ask how should I proceed. Can I submit the package to cran with
this warning? We verified that the installation from source works on
Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Thank you very much,
Franti?ek Barto?

This warning is easy to deal with:

Use plain "=" macro definitions, since others aren't considered portable
enough.

>SOURCES= $(wildcard *.cc) $(wildcard */*.cc)

Replace $(wildcard ...) with hard-coded lists of files.

See the POSIX standard [*], or, indeed, section 'Writing portable
packages' in WRE [**] for a list of Make features considered portable.

Alternatively, add "GNU make" to SystemRequirements: in your
DESCRIPTION. This will silence the warnings, but require the GNU
flavour of Make to install your package.

How do you build the source package before installing it? I tried to
git clone your package, then R CMD build . it, and got a perfectly valid
RoBMA_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz without any *.o files inside. I *think* that R
CMD INSTALL <directory> may be not a good idea, but you can add .*\.o$
to .Rbuildignore to prevent the object files from getting inside your
source package this way.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Valgrind warning on saveRDS,
 about object in external pointer
Message-ID: <4fda6e6227c10640becba2bcca44cdef29c0a065.camel@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am currently getting a valgrind warning in a package that I?ve
developed, which occurs on a call to R?s ?saveRDS?, and I am having a
very hard time trying to figure out what went wrong:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/valgrind/isotree/isotree-Ex.Rout

In more detail:
- The package creates a C++ struct which it accesses through the
external pointer system (Rcpp::Xptr).
- The warning is about an un-initialized value allocated in a call to
C++ std::vector::reserve, which is called on a C++ vector member of the
struct in the external pointer.
- The warning occurs on a call to R?s ?saveRDS?.

I had the idea  that ?saveRDS? wouldn?t do anything about external
pointers in an S3 object, and thus I am wondering why exactly does the
warning occur in ?saveRDS?.

Other than the external pointer, the C++ object is also serialized into
an R raw vector using the Cereal library (which occurs in an earlier R
command, before the problematic ?saveRDS?), and this vector is part of
the objects that get serialized in the call to R?s ?saveRDS?, but as
far as I know, it should not possible to get such a warning about the
original object after those bytes were copied over and only the new
copied bytes are accessed.

Any help is appreciated.

Sincerely,
David Cortes

I'm ready to admit that I didn't read the code well enough, but it
seems to me that the vector resized on line 752 resides in
std::vector<WorkerMemory> worker_memory allocated on lines 411-415 in
int fit_iforest(...) and then disposed of by the end of the function. I
don't see workspace.ix_arr being saved anywhere model_outputs(_ext). I
think that workspace.ix_arr shouldn't even exist by the time the lines
following isolation.forest(...) are executed.

Can you reproduce the warning on your own computer? It might be helpful
to run R -d 'valgrind --vgdb-error=1 --vgdb-stop-at=startup', follow
Valgrind's instructions to attach the debugger to it, type "continue"
into gdb, then trigger the warning in R and use gdb to gather more
information when Valgrind stops the process around the memory access
it considers uninitialised.

Thanks for answering.

I?m not able to reproduce the warning when trying R CMD check with
valgrind on my computer (tried compiling with gcc9 and clang9), nor
with the r-debug docker images from github (
https://github.com/wch/r-debug). However, from what I was told when
trying to upload a new version of the package, the warning still
persist in the CRAN servers when checking the newer version.

About the source code: it actually complains about line
fit_model.cpp:751 :
hplane_root->reserve(exp_nodes);

Which is part of the struct ?ModelOutputsExt *model_outputs? (the one
that gets serialized through Cereal into an R raw vector, later
serialized through ?saveRDS?).

The same std::vector in the struct is heavily used all throughout the
module, and in most cases it?s only used with std::vector::back and
std::vector::emplace_back (first emplace right after L751), so it?s
unlikely that it could have uninitialized elements with no complaints
from asan or valgrind when creating the S3 object that goes to
?saveRDS?.

David Cortes

Oh, this is good news.

I see that these new warnings have already been disabled in R-devel.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] ISNAN warning [-Wfloat-conversion]
Message-ID: <CAL0QV_MZhoLKRXHEJcyCZr+1MKTpK-0wfJvdg5ATSaQf731yHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Please see below warning from GCC (rtools 4.0).
I know that the flag "-Wconversion" is not used by default when building
packages in R but I was wondering if the below warning can be avoided by
changing the ISNAN function in the R C API?
The functions R_IsNaN and R_IsNA do not generate these warnings but they
also have  a different behaviour than ISNAN.

test_ISNAN = inline::cfunction(
  verbose = TRUE,
  language = "C",
  cppargs = "-Wconversion",
  sig = c(x = "SEXP"),
  body = "
  if (ISNAN(asReal(x))) {
    Rprintf(\"Hello\");
  }
  return R_NilValue;
")

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Getting two independent packages with identical S3
 generics to dispatch each other's methods
Message-ID: <7102fe9eaf07c1a402df7f0447c047383e8b0a7c.camel@unsw.edu.au>

Dear All,

I would like to have two packages that do not depend on each other that
have an identical generic to be able to dispatch to each other's (non-
conflicting) methods. If it is of interest, the background for why this
is needed is given at the end of this e-mail.

As it is, it looks like two packages that do not depend on each other
both define a generic, they do not see each other's S3 methods. 

For example, in the two attached minimal packages, which define and
export generic foo() (identical in both packages) and methods
foo.character() and foo.numeric() that are exported via S3method(), we
get,

> library(test.character)
> foo("a")
foo.character() called.
> library(test.numeric)
Attaching package: ?test.numeric?
The following object is masked from ?package:test.character?:
    foo
> foo(1)
foo.numeric() called.
> foo("a")
Error in UseMethod("foo") : 
  no applicable method for 'foo' applied to an object of class "character"

That is, test.numeric::foo() doesn't "see"
test.character:::foo.character() and vice versa. Is there a way to make
them see each other?

This issue has arisen before, e.g. at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25251136/how-to-conditionally-define-a-generic-function-in-r-namespace .

The "clean" solution is, of course, to create a third package to define
the generic that the two packages could import (and, if necessary,
reexport). However, that involves creating an almost-empty package that
then has to be submitted to CRAN, maintained, and add some amount of
storage and computational overhead. Is there another way to do this
that is transparent to the end user?


# Background

This arose as a result of two packages (lme4 and ergm) both wanting to
implement a simulate.formula() method, causing conflicts when the user
wanted to use both at the same time.

ergm has a mechanism for dispatching based on the class of the LHS of
the formula. It does so by defining a generic, simulate_formula() which
evaluates the formula's LHS and dispatches a method (e.g.,
simulate_formula.<CLASS>()) based on that.

Since lme4 and ergm generally use different LHSs, we are thinking of
resolving the conflict by copying the LHS dispatching mechanism from
ergm to lme4, and then defining our own summary_formula methods as
needed.

			Thank you in advance,
			Pavel

Hi Pavel,

I asked essentially the same question a few weeks ago:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2020q2/005609.html

As Jeff already suggested, there is the generics package which might be of use.

Aside from this, I wasn't able to distill a workable solution from the discussion that did not involve adding dependencies to (one of) the two packages.

Best,
Wolfgang

If the semantics of the two generics must remain identical in the 
future, then there is an implicit dependency between the code in the 
packages.  You should formalize this by using one of the dependency 
mechanisms that the language provides, i.e. the clean solution.

Dear Duncan et al.,

Firstly, my apologies for the duplicated query. It seems that I had
searched everywhere but the mailing list where I asked the question.

Secondly, I was wondering if I could get some indication whether CRAN
would accept a package with the following code and documentation (and
only that):

1) A number of exported generics of the form

summary_formula(object, ..., lhs),
simulate_formula(object, nsim=1, seed=NULL, ..., lhs),
etc.,

which expect a formula as their first argument, evaluate the LHS of the
formula, and dispatch based on the class of the result, which can also
be overridden by the lhs= argument.

2) Corresponding S3 methods summary.formula(), simulate.formula(), etc.
methods, that call the corresponding *_formula() generic.

I am familiar with the generics package, but I don't think it's a good
place for this functionality, because this is not the typical
dispatching behaviour, and because *.formula() exports are not
technically generics but S3 methods. In particular, as far as I know,
existing mechanisms make it easy to cherry-pick generics, but they
don't make it easy to cherry-pick methods.

				Best Regards,
				Pavel

I think it would depend on the documentation and the submission message. 
  You'll need to convince them not to reject your package under the "A 
package?s contribution has to be non-trivial" rule.  Explain why you 
can't put the generic in one of the existing packages and import it from 
there into the other one.  (I'd make ergm import lme4, since that only 
adds 5 packages that wouldn't otherwise be present:   "minqa" 
"nloptr"    "statmod"   "Rcpp"      "RcppEigen", and those are all 
reasonably popular packages.)

Message-ID: <CAEXeAoZ3Yj0qmtsSxrQ-toUEbmcfG19qvpmUWqrUtMDEQHY1Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to submit a new version of the package to CRAN today and got an
email back about a pre-test error:

Windows: <
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/newscatcheR_0.1.0_20200712_103032/Windows/00check.log
>
Status: 1 ERROR

The full logs are here: <
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/newscatcheR_0.1.0_20200712_103032/
>

However, the winbuilder check didn't return any errors both on the R Under
development (unstable)  and R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) (logs:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/C38WY20VHvTO/ and
https://win-builder.r-project.org/aNK5eJQxxyGH/)

The package's code is here: https://github.com/discindo/newscatcheR

I am fairly new to packages and CRAN and I am not sure if the pre-tests are
doing the same thing as the winbuilder when sent from devtools.

When searching for a possible solution I found this thread that looks like
tibble might be causing the issue if it is not updated to 3.0.3 but I am
not sure (
https://community.rstudio.com/t/warning-messages-when-printing-tibbles/72622
).

Thanks for any help.

Regarding where to save the jar file, you might be interested in "app dirs" (via tools::R_user_dir() in R from 4.0, the rappdirs package, the hoardr package) cf https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/03/12/user-preferences/#not-so-temporary-files3

So a tet file in the inst/jar directory giving the link to the GitHub repo would be fine in this case?

I guess it would be stretching it a bit, as the jar file is 8.2 MB, and plantuml has regular continuous updates, so I would prefer to keep it dynamic.

(Admin privileges are often necessary to install packages in the main library.)? Generally I think everyone can install packages somewhere, but users do really get confused when they have multiple library locations, possibly each containing a different version of a package.

So the suggested option would be to have a function, which 
1) ask the user to create a directory in the home folder 
2) download the jar file into that directory or, when no permission is granted, into the tmpdir()

Thanks, no major changes necessary for that,

Rainer

Something with the ellipsis installation on the check machines seems 
broken, this is something for the CRAN team (which I am a member of) and 
will be fixed.

Hi Team,
I am unable to post messages to this group and keep getting "waiting for moderator" message from bounce email i.e. "R-package-devel <r-package-devel-bounces at r-project.org>".
Is there any criteria of sending the message to devel group?

Thanks you too.

That is also what I am doing. Note that I am downloading jar files into a directory created in rappdirs::user_data_dir() using the command download.file(url, ...).

If I do not specify 'mode='wb'' in download.file() on a Windows OS, downloaded jar file is corrupted and cannot be used because a text file is created in which \n are converted into \r\n, which does not make sens for a binary file.

I hope it can help
Cheers

On a related note:

I also need to set mode="wb" to download binary files on Windows in my rdwd package.
I'm considering calling download.file() with that mode as the default.
Is there any problem with that, potentially on other OS or for non-binary files?

Feel free to comment here to not crowd the mailing list:
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/issues/20

Thanks,
Berry

Jup - exactly.

Yes - the `mode = ?wb?` bit me as well - developing on MacOS, testing on travis on GitHub with Linux and Mac,, and what did I get, a corrupt jar on windows.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CALvJfh+=_xC9zytrGpwjQHVM073iKDMXzbn5JXSbx3gZnTyDWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My first posting.  Apologies in advance if I misspeak or am asking a dumb
question.

I maintain a small package on CRAN
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CGPfunctions/index.html

Source is on Github here https://github.com/ibecav/CGPfunctions/

Recently received note I needed to fix my package because of changes to
broom.  Corrections made and everything passes locally.

When I submit to rhub::check_for_cran() however it creates an error in the
development branch
*Build ID:* CGPfunctions_0.6.2.tar.gz-3e48a7f97fa04b64924552dc50b43fd2


with:

#> Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()),

Looking at data.table on CRAN I see there is no windows binary
Windows binaries: r-devel: not available
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/4.1/ReadMe>,


I don't use any data.table functions, I don't import it, or suggest it or
enhance it it's being pulled in through some dependency in car and/or broom.

Am I okay to submit to CRAN?  Is there a setting I can change?
Obviously data.table exists despite what Rhub is reporting.

Thank you hopefully that is a clear enough description.

Chuck

Hello,

I'm trying to submit an updated version of the RPPanalyzer package,
because of an upcoming maintainer change for the package.

But unfortunately the update does not pass the submit check system. :(
The details are here: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_RPPanalyzer.html)

inux and Windows are passed, but it keeps crashing for MacOS 
(r-release-macos-x86_x64) giving this error:

Error in file(con, "w") : cannot open the connection

(Full log here: 
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-x86_64/RPPanalyzer-00install.html)

I have no clue what might throw this message nor how to fix it ?

Any help is therefore very appreciated :)

Regards,
Torsten Schoeps

My fault. I was reading the GitHub source code instead of CRAN package
source code.

My current system is amd64 Debian 9.12 (gcc 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) with R
3.6.3-1~stretchcran.0. I have built a package from the current GitHub
source of the package and ran R -d 'valgrind --track-origins=yes'
--vanilla < isotree-Ex.R. This resulted in multiple Valgrind warnings
about accessing uninitialised values created by heap allocations at
fit_model.cpp:783 and fit_model.cpp:788.

The first such error can be traced to a pointer to
ext_model_ptr->hplanes[0][2].remainder:

(gdb) frame 2

(In some stack frames gdb helpfully says that the pointer is optimised
out, but in others it can be accessed.)

I grepped the source code for 'remainder =' and found one assignment to
hplanes.back().remainder in extended.cpp:507. Could
hplanes.emplace_back() happen without a corresponding assignment to
hplanes.back().remainder?

Message-ID: <CAAVP=a=JBcHYaLWJLUUj9qisufmDkwTLB+4Z=VsB44Kmiq3wVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know of a setup guide for getting R and Rtools 4.0 up and
running on Wine with the Windows Server 2008 R2 VM? Do other maintainers
with more knowhow think that would be useful for debugging purposes?

I've been trying to test out some flto gcc things for windows by setting up
a local wine VM on my ubuntu box. Wine has an option for Windows Server
2008 R2 (which I believe is the windows session CRAN uses?) If anyone has
done this before and knows of a guide somewhere that would be very helpful!

Steve Bronder

Are you sure you want to try to run R etc. under Wine?

- If you have Windows running, either directly or in a VM, you can run R there.
- If you have Windows and want to run R under some other OS, then set up a VM
e.g., Linux Mint, for that. I sometimes test R for Windows in a VirtualBox VM
for Win10, but generally run in Linux Mint. I've also run R in some Linux VMs
to test for specific dependencies in some distros.

I rather doubt R will run very well in Linux under Wine. My experience with Wine
is that a few apps (e.g. Irfanview) run well, but many give lots of trouble.

If you don't mind multi-gig docker containers, this can be helpful:

https://github.com/scottyhardy/docker-wine

It doesn't work with 64 bit versions of R as far as I could tell, but 32
bit did install and start correctly in a few clicks when I tried last year.

Thanks a lot for the answer!

I unfortunately wasn?t able to reproduce it with the same OS + compiler
+ valgrind settings, but from what I see in the message, turns out in
the end it might indeed be due to Cereal copying raw bytes into an R
vector and Valgrind complaining about the copied bytes rather than the
original object.

And it also looks like it could be issue with default initializations.
With this I?ve now learned that ?Struct() {}? and ?Struct()=default?
are not the same thing.

Still, oddly enough that the complaint happens only at ?saveRDS? when
tested on the CRAN servers.

Thanks again for your help!

Best regards,
David Cortes

Hi, this is because data.table is not available as a binary package
for R-devel, on CRAN. You can tell R to build it from source like
this:

rhub::check(
  platform="windows-x86_64-devel",
  env_vars=c(R_COMPILE_AND_INSTALL_PACKAGES = "always")
)

Btw. please report R-ghub errors in the issue tracker, e.g.
https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/367#issuecomment-621757715

Thanks,
Gabor

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Interpret feedback: not write testthat-tests in
 examples
Message-ID: <1594904220089.18734.11146@webmail8>

Dear R package developers,

I would enjoy some help regarding some feedback I got on my package from a CRAN volunteer, as I am unsure how to interpret this correctly.

This is the feedback I got (I added '[do]'):

> Please [do] not write testthat-tests in your examples.

I wonder if this is about using `testthat` or using tests in general.

To simplify the context, say I wrote a package with a function called `add`, that adds two numbers. My example code would then be something like this:

```
library(testthat)

expect_equal(add(1, 2), 3)
```

The first interpretation is about using `testthat`: maybe I should use base R (`stopifnot`) or another testing library (`testit`) or hand-craft it myself?

The second interpretation is about using tests in example code. I like to actively demonstrate that my code works as expected. I checked the policies regarding examples, and I could not find a rule that I should refrain from doing so.

What is the correct response to this feedback?

Thanks for your guidance, Richel Bilderbeek

Richel,

I think that feedback is important. Examples are examples first, and tests
second, as in if your examples no longer work, then maybe you need to check
your underlying code.

{testthat} tests belong in their own `tests` directory, and are used to
directly test your code and provide feedback about whether your code is
working.

The pattern I normally see if you want to directly check the output of an
example is a `stopifnot(x == y)`, but I've never observed having
`expect_equal` in example code.

There might not be a policy against it, but I think the general expectation
is that {testthat} code stays in `tests`, not in examples in the
documentation.

Dear Richel,

The comment itself is pretty clear I think: to be accepted on CRAN you
should not use testthat tests in your examples.

I can't speak for CRAN but I'm pretty convinced this is for testing in
general.

Tests are for testing, not for demonstration. Most users of your package
will probably have never heard of testthat because they are not package
authors. They also probably don't need testthat to use your package, so it
distracts them from learning how your package works. Packages like testthat
(and RUnit, unity and tinytest) are in the first place aimed at package
authors to make sure that their package works as it should and to avoid
re-introducing bugs (regressions).



Best,
Mark

If the point of having, say,

stopifnot(add(1, 2) == sum(c(1, 2))

is to make it explicit to the reader that your add() function gives
the same results as sum(), then I argue that is valid to use in an
example.  I'm pretty sure I've used that in some of my examples.  For
the purpose, there should be no reason why you can't use other
"assert" functions for this purpose, e.g.

testthat::expect_equal(add(1, 2), sum(c(1, 2))

Now, if the point of your "assert" statement is only to validate your
package/code, then I agree it should not be in the example code
because it adds clutter.  Such validation should be in a package test.

So, if the former, I suggest you reply to the CRAN Team and explain this.

Dear R package developers,

Thanks so much for the generous responses!

In summary:

- one should usually not write tests in examples, that's what the 'tests' folder is for
- if there is a demonstration, use a simple stopifnot, as one cannot assume a regular reader knows about the testthat package

Thanks again and the best, Richel Bilderbeek

The point of an example is to provide an illustration of how the function should be used for people who are not software developers. IMO any use of any other functions should be absolutely minimized to reduce the cognitive overload ("you need to understand 13 other concepts before you can understand what this function does"). Even stopifnot is in my view best avoided, and if you choose to use it then the use of that function should come _after_ the use of the function so it can be ignored by the reader without disrupting their reading of the example.

Complex interactions between functions should be described in vignettes, and tests should be stored in test code. R package help already has a reputation for being obtuse to beginners and mixing tests into examples exacerbates that perception.

Thanks! I'm hoping if I can get this all working locally I can put
everything into a docker container for other folks. At this point I have R
up and running and it can install binary packages, but there are some
terrible terrible Cygwin/Rtools errors I can't figure out. In particular
this warning / message seems worrisome

Cygwin WARNING:
  Couldn't compute FAST_CWD pointer.  This typically occurs if you're using
  an older Cygwin version on a newer Windows.  Please update to the latest
  available Cygwin version from https://cygwin.com/.  If the problem
persists,
  please see https://cygwin.com/problems.html

If anyone has interest I can post a script for setting up the wine instance
as far as I can get atm.

Sadly I don't have access to a windows machine. If I can't figure this out
then I'll probably just get a windows aws instance. But it would be nice
for people to have a wine setup they could test locally on.

Yes I'm 80/20 on whether compilation with Rtools will totally work on wine.
But if I can get this all setup and put it into a docker file I think it
will be useful for other people as well so it's worth spending a bit of
time on.

If the point is to communicate this to users I would write something like

## The following evaluates to TRUE:
add(1, 2) == sum(c(1, 2)

Using stopifnot just adds clutter that obscures the message for a
human reader; testthat::expect_equal even more so.

FWIW/in defense of the OP, this is a *very* common idiom in the base R 
code base.? There may be some false positives, but

 ?find . -name "*.Rd" -exec grep -Fl "stopifnot(" {} \; | grep -v doc | wc

lists 187 files, e.g. from src/library/utils/man/object.size.Rd

stopifnot(identical( ## assert that all three are the same :
 ???????????? unique(substr(as.vector(fsl), 1,5)),
 ???????????? format(round(as.vector(sl)/1024, 1))))

Looks like 187 opportunities to improve clarity.

And I probably wrote some of them, but I don't think I would now.
As a rule, I think the documentation is clearer without the tests.

On the other hand, we don't all agree on these things.

I agree with the consensus that documentation is for humans, while tests
are for computers.

Hello:


 ????? I'm getting two warnings that I don't know how to fix on both 
4.0.2 under macOS 10.15.5 and 4.0.0 under TRAVIS-CI; the email from 
Travis CI <builds at travis-ci.org> is copied below.


NON-ASCII INPUT:


* checking Rd files ... WARNING
man/nuclearWeaponStates.Rd: non-ASCII input and no declared encoding
problem found in ?nuclearWeaponStates.Rd?


 ????? I'm virtually certain this comes from the following:


 ? \href{https://www.americansecurityproject.org/ASP Reports/Ref 0072 - 
North Korea?s Nuclear Program .pdf}{Derek Bolton (2012) North Korea's 
Nuclear Program} (2012-08, American Security Program, accessed 2020-07-15)


 ????? If you look carefully, you see spaces and a right single quote in 
the URL.? If I copy this URL into a browser and back out again, I get 
the following:


https://www.americansecurityproject.org/ASP%20Reports/Ref%200072%20-%20North%20Korea%E2%80%99s%20Nuclear%20Program%20.pdf


 ????? However, if I use this inside "\href", "R CMD check" doesn't 
recognize the close curly bracket because of the presence of the 
non-ASCII characters.? I could leave out the URL, but that would degrade 
the quality of the documentation.


"--DATA-COMPRESS" IGNORED


 ????? I'm getting, " Note: significantly better compression could be 
obtained by using R CMD build --resave-data".? I get this message even 
though I use "R CMD build --data-compress Ecdat".? I also tried "R CMD 
build Ecdat --data-compress" and got the same result.


 ????? Suggestions?
 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Interpret feedback: not write testthat-tests in

If you do want to communicate around tests a bit more, without cluttering the manual, you might find the covrpage package interesting?https://yonicd.github.io/covrpage/ 
It creates a README in the tests folder, with test results, and it can create a vignette with the same content.

stopifnot(add(1, 2) == sum(c(1, 2))

is to make it explicit to the reader that your add() function gives
the same results as sum(), then I argue that is valid to use in an
example.? I'm pretty sure I've used that in some of my examples.? For
the purpose, there should be no reason why you can't use other
"assert" functions for this purpose, e.g.

testthat::expect_equal(add(1, 2), sum(c(1, 2))

Now, if the point of your "assert" statement is only to validate your
package/code, then I agree it should not be in the example code
because it adds clutter.? Such validation should be in a package test.

So, if the former, I suggest you reply to the CRAN Team and explain this.

WRE section 2.3 [*] provides an example of \href with RFC3986
percent-encoding. Since % is a comment character in Rd, the percent
signs have to be escaped with backslashes:

\href{https://www.americansecurityproject.org/ASP\%20Reports/Ref\%200072\%20-\%20North\%20Korea\%E2\%80\%99s\%20Nuclear\%20Program\%20.pdf}{Derek
Bolton (2012) North Korea's Nuclear Program}

This only works correctly in R >= 3.1.3, but results in correct output
in both HTML and PDF formats.

Alternatively, it should be possible to declare the encoding of the Rd
file using \encoding{UTF-8} (WRE 2.14 [**]), but in my tests (R 3.6.3,
could have been fixed in later versions) it results in a broken link in
Rd2pdf output.

The note offers you to try adding --resave-data to R CMD build, not
--data-compress. What happens if you use --resave-data=best?
--data-compress doesn't seem to be an R CMD build option; at least
it's not mentioned in R CMD build --help.

WRE 1.1.6 [***] provides an example of --data-compress as an option of
R CMD INSTALL (not build).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Note: information on .o files is not available /

Message-ID: <CAMHmY_wip6F6mAchw32F3=0uUsH6j8w-Agt+Rk8PuSbR02YqYg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to get an R package with C++ code on CRAN and I have one NOTE
remaining, for which I can't find a solution:

Note: information on .o files for x64 is not available
  File
'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/gpboost/libs/x64/lib_gpboost.dll':
    Found '_exit', possibly from '_exit' (C)
    Found 'abort', possibly from 'abort' (C), 'runtime' (Fortran)
    Found 'exit', possibly from 'exit' (C), 'stop' (Fortran)
    Found 'printf', possibly from 'printf' (C)

As much as I search through my code, I can't find the place / headers where
these calls / symbols originate. Also, I have no idea how to add
information on .o files (apart from the shared library, there are no .o
files). The .tar.gz file for the package can be found on
https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/blob/master/gpboost_0.2.0.tar.gz. Note
that the shared library is compiled using install.libs.R (this is a
deliberate choice) and the flag "GPB_R_BUILD" is set when compiling for the
R package (I have tried to put "#ifndef GPB_R_BUILD" around all headers
that could cause the problems with exit / abort calls, but apparently I
have not been able to find all).

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Fabio Sigrist

So maybe you tried that already but I noticed that sometimes when I do the
check on the package directory rather than on the tarball I get similar
errors. I don't know if that's the problem but it should be a quick thing
to try.

 ????? Can you run the checks only on the subdirectory containing the 
compiled code?? If yes, then you can run it only on half of that 
directory and identify it with a binary search.


 ????? Some years ago, I found a particularly difficult bug that way.? 
If I recall correctly, I made a copy of the package, deleted half of the 
*.Rd files, etc., until I identified which *.Rd file. Then I deleted 
~half of the contents of that *.Rd file until I isolated the problem.? 
It was neither easy nor fun, but it was what I did to find and then fix 
the problem.


 ????? Hope this helps,
 ????? Spencer

to

I managed to `R CMD INSTALL` the package with gcc-8 on Ubuntu. Then
doing `cd ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6/gpboost/libs/` and
 - nm *.so -C | grep exit
 - nm *.so -C | grep abort
 - nm *.so -C | grep printf

yields nothing. However, doing `nm *.so -C | grep assert` yields
                 U __assert_fail@@GLIBC_2.2.5

and doing `grep "assert" -nr .` shows that `assert` is being called.
Thus, is everything build with `-NDEBUG`? See
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#DOCF76

You will have to look harder. The external library, likely written without
knowledge of these (useful for R, otherwise arbitrary) constraint is likely
to contain exit(), (f)printf(), puts(), ... or alike.

If you want your package on CRAN, you need to change this. That's the price.
Code called from R cannot abort the session, and needs to communicate via R's
output streams.

Very nice catch!

Given the package (and underlying library) has a joint repo, it is pretty
easy to search directly at GitHub too, and it looks like all the required
legwork has been done to #ifdef printf() statements and alike.

Now, I had to do the same work for packages of mine too in the past, and I
don't recall the test output "crossing". So if it really were only assert
coming back in via -NDEBUG then the tests for printf would NOT be triggered.
So something else must likely be hiding.  Which is ... difficult to check in
a codebase that includes duplicate copies of Eigen, LighGBM, ... and more.

A curious thing is that it seems to only happen on Windows. I tried
searching objdump -D output for the offending functions by means of a
Perl5 one-liner [1] and found that the functions are all called by
various bits of libgcc, OpenMP, C and C++ runtimes. This is probably
caused by linking your R package with -static-libstdc++ (which is set
in CMakeLists.txt if(WIN32 AND MINGW)).

> Note that the shared library is compiled using install.libs.R (this

Some of the things it does aren't very portable (e.g. manually setting
most -W flags is discouraged). In particular, I had to manually remove
-Wno-error=cast-function-type from CMakeLists.txt to build the package
with GCC 6.3.0-18+deb9u1, despite it passing the version check
(>=4.8.2).

Hello, Ivan et al.:


 ????? I tried escaping "%" every time it occurred without success, but 
adding "\encoding{UTF-8}" as the 4th line of nuclearWeaponStates.Rd 
eliminated that problem.


 ????? Sadly, I tried "R CMD build --resave-data=best Ecdat", "R CMD 
build --resave-data Ecdat", "R CMD build Ecdat --resave-data", and "R 
CMD build Ecdat --resave-data=best", all without success.? I also noted 
that .travis.yml contains "r_build_args: --resave-data", which I 
remember adding some time ago to fix this problem.? And Travis reported 
this problem as well.? This suggests to me that a change was introduced 
with R 4.0.0 that disabled this option.


 ????? I also tried loading and resaving all the files in the data 
directory.? This seemed to achieve some additional compression on 
average, but I still got, "Note: significantly better compression could 
be obtained by using "R CMD build --resave-data".? I then tried load and 
saveRDS on each one individually, but at least the first of the 
resulting *.rda files was corrupted, so I restored what I had before.


 ????? Anyway, Ivan's suggestion fixed the UTF-8 problem and Travis 
confirmed that it can't make "--resave-data" work, either ;-)? If a CRAN 
maintainer complains about the compression problem, I can report what I 
tried and see what they suggest.


 ????? Thanks again,
 ????? Spencer Graves

Dear R community experts,

The CRAN package check page shows an ?ERROR? status for my ?Rmbal? package on the r-release-macos-x86_64 flavor. The error seems to be related to a failed connection. The following links show the error message.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Rmbal.html

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-x86_64/Rmbal-00check.html

There is also one ?NOTE? regarding the missing Rdpack and magrittr importFroms in the NAMESPACE file which I?ve already fixed it. I don?t know if the ?ERROR? message I get on r-release-macos-x86_64  is due to this ?NOTE? message or not.

The ?ERROR? and ?NOTE? messages only appeared on CRAN, I didn?t receive any message from rhub::check_for_cran(env_vars = c(R_COMPILE_AND_INSTALL_PACKAGES = ?always?).

Your help is really appreciated!

Regards,
Farshad Tabasinejad

Glad it works for you, but you might want to check that the link still
leads to the correct URL in the PDF output. In particular, the
following .Rd file:

\encoding{UTF-8}
\title{title}\name{name}\description{
\href{https://www.americansecurityproject.org/ASP Reports/Ref 0072 -
North Korea?s Nuclear Program .pdf}{Derek Bolton (2012) North Korea's
Nuclear Program}

\href{https://www.americansecurityproject.org/ASP\%20Reports/Ref\%200072\%20-\%20North\%20Korea\%E2\%80\%99s\%20Nuclear\%20Program\%20.pdf}{Derek
Bolton (2012) North Korea's Nuclear Program}
}

...gives two working links when processed with R CMD Rdconv -t html,
but when I process it using R CMD Rd2pdf, the first link gets a
\T1\textquoteright instead of ? in its URL, which makes it invalid. This
could be a LaTeX problem on my part, of course.

> I also tried loading and resaving all the files in the data

You can also try using tools::resaveRdaFiles with various parameters if
you are interested.

> at least the first of the resulting *.rda files was corrupted

This sounds like trying to load a version-3 *.rda file (implemented in
3.5.0, default since 3.6.0) using an older version of R. Or a possible
indicator of a hardware problem.

Many thanks to everybody for the valuable answers.

Several people (Benjamin and Ivan) pointed to the lack of portability due
to the "-Wno-cast-function-type" flag. I have changed this.

Further, as suggested by Benjamin, I also added the " -DNDEBUG" flag.
Consequently, there is no assert call anymore when compiling with gcc under
Linux.

Ivan suggested that the forbidden exit/abort calls might be caused by
linking the R package with -static-libstdc+. I have now removed this but I
am still getting the " Found '_exit'" etc. notes. It is also unclear to me
why these exit / abort symbols are only found under Windows / MinGW and not
under Linux.

I agree with Dirks assessment. It seems that the bottom line is that it is
very difficult to find the exit / abort calls. Very unfortunate...

I have

in a package and its not finding the coerce definition from the raster
package. I know I need to add an @import roxygen2 directive of some kind,
but I'm not sure the correct syntax. My first try generated a warning that

What is the correct way to do this? Or does raster need to export this

 ?? I think this is a classic confusing R message.? Try adding methods 
to the Imports: statement in your DESCRIPTION file and see if that 
helps. (Maybe I should file a bug report about that error message - it 
confuses me every time.)

Yes, indeed, it is confusing. You don't need to file a new bug report, though. There is one already:

https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17179

Please feel free to comment there. This thread could serve as another confirmation. :-)

Best regards,
Sebastian

Thanks for pointing to the bug.

Now I am finding I cannot use the 'as' definitions from 'raster' without
loading the package. Do I need an @import directive that specifies the
definitions in the 'raster' package? My understanding is that the 'setAs'
function generates a 'coerce,...' signature but I'm not sure how to import
it to my package.

Thanks again.

HelloYesterday a new version of cartograflow v1.0.3 was updated on the crank.? Everything seems to be OK.
However, when I write in help cartograflow I don't see the thumbnail with the different possibilities of visualization: pdf, HTML ...
Is this normal?
Thank you in advance for your answer

Is this the best place to ask?

R-SIG-Mac [*] is probably a better place for this. The short answer is
that OpenMP support has been dropped from the compiler supplied with
macOS, but there are workarounds [**].

Hello,

In an R function within a package, I would like to call a Fortran subroutine to compute lower gamma function. Any advice will be appreciated.

Thanks!

 ??? Is there a reason not to use pgamma(), possibly adjusted by a 
(de-)normalizing constant??? (See detailed notes in ?pgamma)

Why? -- see ?dgamma

See also the section on including fortran code in "Writing R Extensions,"
which should be your first port of call for such questions.

If neither of these is what you need, it may be helpful if you explain why
not.

BTW, if you search for "incomplete gamma function" on Rseek.org, you will
find whole packages for this.

Sorry for not making myself clear: The Fortran subroutine in an R package needs to call incomplete gamma function.

You can often find this kind of code on netlib.org.  Just include it with
the fortran code in your package.

As others have said, built-in function pgamma is a (normalized) version of the incomplete gamma function!   John

Thanks to Ben and John. Perhaps the program should call pgamma in R and pass the number to Fortran. Calling some Fortran subroutines older than R can trigger concerns when submitting the package to the CRAN.

 ? Interesting.? It looks like the way to make use of this is to combine 
the information in section 6.7.1 ("Distribution functions", including 
pgamma ...) with section 6.6 "Calling C from Fortran and vice versa" ?

 ? Interesting.? It looks like the way to make use of this is to combine the information in section 6.7.1 ("Distribution functions", including pgamma ...) with section 6.6 "Calling C from Fortran and vice versa" ?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error in CHECK caused by dev.off()
Message-ID: <15fca50d-de12-f13b-af24-aabebdf22d8a@bebac.at>

Dear all,

I have two variables, foo and bar. The first is TRUE if a png should be 
created and the second is TRUE if an already existing one should be 
overwritten.
At the end of the plot I had
if (foo | (foo & bar)) dev.off()
This worked as expected in all versions of my package built in R up to 
v3.6.3. However, when I CHECK the package in v4.0.2 I get:
 > grDevices::dev.off()
Error in grDevices::dev.off() :
 ? cannot shut down device 1 (the null device)
Execution halted

I tried:
if (foo | (foo & bar)) {
 ? dev <- dev.list()
 ? if (!is.null(dev)) {
 ??? if (dev == 2) invisible(dev.off())
 ? }
}
without success (same error).

Even the more general
if (foo | (foo & bar)) {
 ? graphics.off()
}
did not work.

The plot is called only in an example of one man-page -- though embedded 
in \donttest{}.
Even if I set both foo and bar to FALSE (i.e., the respective part of 
the code should not be executed at all), I get the same error.

Any ideas/suggestions?

Regards,
Helmut

Hmm... I see 2 possibilities for still getting an error while the 
concerned part of code is not supposed to be run:

  - either you are running not updated version of your package;
  - or the error comes from some other place of the code.

Sorry but without a minimal reproducible example I cannot help more.
Best,
Serguei.

I suspect your foo and bar variables are not logical anymore... insufficient info. However, why aren't you using short-circuit && and || operators?

Assuming that foo and bar are each length one variables, this test is 
logically equivalent to

   if (foo) {

Is that really what you intended?

I _can_ built the package and it runs as intended. Only the CHECK throws 
the error.

Closing the device is required only _once_ in the entire package.
In my NAMESPACE I have (and had in all previous versions):
importFrom(grDevices, png, graphics.off, dev.list, dev.off)

> Sorry but without a minimal reproducible example I cannot help more.

The problem is that I cannot reproduce it as well. Only CHECK laments 
about dev.off() which I changed to graphics.off() in the meantime.

library(grDevices)
foo <- TRUE?? # shall we plot?
png.path <- "~/" # user's home folder
png.path <- normalizePath(png.path)
if (foo) {
 ? png(paste0(png.path, "test.png"), width = 480, height = 480, 
pointsize = 12)
}
plot(x = 0:1, y = 0:1, type = "l", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
if (foo) {
 ? graphics.off()
}

Helmut

You don't test whether the call to png() succeeded.  During a check, it 
probably wouldn't, because you aren't allowed to write to "~/".  Your 
package should be writing to tempdir(), or a location entered by the user.

Following WRE 1.5.6 (Namespaces with S4 classes and methods), you should
have "Depends: methods" in your DESCRIPTION, and "import(methods)" or a
more selective "importFrom(methods, ...)" directive in your NAMESPACE.

Then you would usually use the NAMESPACE directive

    importMethodsFrom(package, generic)

to explicitly import S4 methods exported from another package.
However, the raster package does not do

    exportMethods(coerce)

so if you try

    importMethodsFrom(raster, coerce)

you will get

> Error: object ?coerce? is not exported by 'namespace:raster'

when trying to install your package (also during R CMD check, of course).

To solve this problem, you could either

- import raster's entire NAMESPACE via import(raster)

- or ask maintainer("raster") to exportMethods(coerce)

- or do

    importClassesFrom(raster, RasterLayer)

which will magically make the corresponding coerce methods available as
well.

HTH!

Correct. However,
 ? if (file.exists(paste0(png.path, "test.png"))) graphics.off()
worked in the example but not in the package...

The user is asked to provide a certain path indeed. Only if none is 
provided, the fallback is "~/" (which is always writable). The package 
is intended for "common" users and not "R-geeks". If I would write to 
tempdir(), I guess chances are pretty low that a user will be able to 
locate the file.
What I still fail to understand: CHECK laments about 
grDevices::dev.off() in a certain man page, where I removed the argument 
foo completely in one example (which is within \donttest{}). Hence, the 
entire plotting routine is not executed at all. Furthermore, dev.off() 
is nowhere used, only graphics.off() - now after file.exists().

Helmut

That disqualifies your package from inclusion on CRAN.  If no 
destination is provided and tempdir() isn't acceptable, you shouldn't 
write anything.  The user may be keeping an irreplaceable piece of 
information in "~/test.png", and your package would destroy it.  It's 
not your decision to make to trespass on the user's file space.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] inappropriate maintainer moniker
Message-ID: <CAEp5mpCNDh11KpWqdmA0MRH43ok5iFHOFKoURwY9wVJ_uJrzPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello R-pkg-devel,

Our package vcfR,

https://github.com/knausb/vcfR

has been removed from CRAN because they asked me to make changes that I
have not been able to make before their deadline. One of the issues was
that the moniker

"briank.lists"

is not appropriate and that we should see CRAN policy. I interpret "CRAN
policy" here to be the following link.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

I'm struggling with *why* is this inappropriate, so I do not understand how
to fix it. My attempt to interpret this issue is that this "moniker" has
been interpreted as a "mailing list" by a CRAN member. The policy states
that a "single designated maintainer (a person, not a mailing list)" should
be included in the DESCRIPTION. However, in vcfR this address is a "single
designated maintainer" (me). It's where I receive mail from various mailing
lists I've signed up for. For example, mail I receive from "R-pkg-devel"
comes to this address. So I feel that this is confusion on the side of
CRAN. Does anyone see a reason for *why* this may be considered
inappropriate?

Thank you!
Brian Knaus

 ??? Once all the other issues are resolved, I'd suggest e-mailing 
r-cran-submissions with this explanation and asking for clarification.

 ??? My interpretation would have been the same as yours (i.e., that 
this is an appropriate e-mail address, and that CRAN maintainers may 
have misinterpreted it a mailing list address).

Can you please point to such a policy in the R-Extension Manual? Eight 
versions of the package were accepted by CRAN and three times checked by 
members of the team.

BTW, the package passed on winbuilder:
Your package replicateBE_1.0.14.9000.tar.gz has been built (if working) 
and checked for Windows.
Please check the log files and (if working) the binary package at:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/k2tGfNoY7y88
The files will be removed after roughly 72 hours.
Installation time in seconds: 41
Check time in seconds: 251
Status: 1 NOTE
R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)
Hence, I suspect that there is a problem with CHECK which I run locally 
on my machine.

The package is used in a regulated environment (e.g., for the FDA). The 
name of the file is always unique, i.e., depends on the input. The code 
checks whether a file with the same name already exist and -- if yes -- 
asks the user to confirm overwriting it.
The man-pages make clear that a path should be provided. If none is 
provided, a message is issued informing the user that results are saved 
in the home directory. By using tempdir() the user would have to move 
all files to another location before the session is closed.

It is explained here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html
Section about source packages:
"Packages should not write in the user?s home filespace (including
clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R
session?s temporary directory (or during installation in the location
pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should be cleaned up)."

And I think the policy was different at some point in the past. Anyway,
it's a good policy - just get a temporary folder and your desired file
name - e.g.:
file.path(tempdir(), "your_file.png")

Best regards,
David Cortes

THX; I missed that! However, the policy continues:
"Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the 
package obtains confirmation from the user."
IMHO, this is applicable here (i.e., the user _should_ specify a 
directory (as recommended in the man-pages), and only if none is 
provided, a warning is issued and confirmation obtained).
If I would use tempdir() and the user forgets to copy the result files 
to another location and closes the console, everything would be lost and 
the user would have to start again from scratch. I think that this is 
not very user-friendly.

I would issue an error instead of a warning, and in the error message, 
suggest some code that should work.

Helmut,

For previous uploads you affirmed that you read the CRAN Repository Policy
which states

     * The code and examples provided in a package should never do anything
       which might be regarded as malicious or anti-social. The following are
       illustrative examples from past experience.

       [...]

          * - Packages should not write in the user?s home filespace
            (including clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system
            apart from the R session?s temporary directory (or during
            installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage
            should be cleaned up). Installing into the system?s R
            installation (e.g., scripts to its bin directory) is not allowed.

Your package appears to violate that requirement. I would fix the package.

Dirk

Back to the original topic: graphics.off() is probably not what you
want. It shuts down *all* open graphics devices, not just the current
one. Example code or your plotting functions should not do that.

Calling graphics.off() in example code will also disturb standard R CMD
check. Before running the examples, R CMD check opens a pdf device to
store any graphics output [1]. You will find the resulting pdf file in
{PACKAGE}.Rcheck/{PACKAGE}-Ex.pdf after R CMD check. [BTW, the plots
therein will be usefully annotated with the names of the originating
help pages.]

R CMD check will eventually fail from trying to close this pdf device
after running the examples [2], if you have already closed all graphics
devices (including this pdf device) through code in your examples. This
is where the

Error in grDevices::dev.off() :
  cannot shut down device 1 (the null device)
Execution halted

actually came from.

Finally, many of the graphics devices are platform-specific and the png
device may not even be available. So it is reasonable to condition on
capabilities("png") or to put such examples in \donttest. The latter is
also used in the example code for grDevices::png, at least in the Unix
version of the man page [3].

HTH!

BTW, on Unix-alikes, example(png) writes to files myplot.png,
myplot1.jpeg, and myplot2.jpeg in the current working directory. This
should be fixed.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Check Error Due to Unicode in Documentation
Message-ID: <02ce01d6612d$d1323740$7396a5c0$@denney.ws>

Hello,

 

I have a personal package that I?d eventually like to clean up and either
find other packages to be homes for the functions or perhaps eventually
release it on CRAN.  To that end, I try to keep package checks working.

 

One of the functions that I use is to try to simplify Unicode text to ASCII.
With that, I tend to receive data that is scientifically-focused to the mu
character should be converted to a ?u? instead of the standard conversion to
?m?.  On top of that, there are at least two Unicode characters that are
visually the mu character, one is the micro character and the other is an
actual lowercase mu.  This function converts both of those to ?u? as
desired.

 

I generate the documentation using roxygen2, but the text in the
documentation aligns with the expected Unicode character, so I think the
issue is not with roxygen.

 

The issue is that Codoc gives the following error:

 

* checking for code/documentation mismatches ... WARNING

Codoc mismatches from documentation object 'unicode_to_ascii':

unicode_to_ascii.character

  Code: function(x, verbose = FALSE, pattern = c("?", "?"), replacement

                 = c("u", "u"), general_

 

But, the code and documentation appear to be the same.  I think that the
issue relates to something with Unicode support in Codoc, but I?m not sure
how to test for that.  The code is here:

 

https://github.com/billdenney/bsd.report/blob/454caf217c5b333af1d65c7e63bbad
4194320e07/R/unicode_to_ascii.R#L28-L31

 

And the documentation is here:

 

https://github.com/billdenney/bsd.report/blob/454caf217c5b333af1d65c7e63bbad
4194320e07/man/unicode_to_ascii.Rd#L17-L24

 

Do you have any suggestions on how to make this code/documentation work with
Codoc?

 

Thanks,

 

Bill

Ah! For years I was wondering where the PDF comes from.

OK, now I have:
if (file.exists("myfile") & !is.null(dev.list()["png"]) {
 ? invisible(dev.off(dev.list()["png"]))
}
You made my day. No error in check() any more.

Ouch!

Done.

If you change the source to include the explicit characters (i.e. use 
pattern = c("?", "?") instead of pattern=c("\u03bc", "\u00b5")), does 
that help?

It may cause other issues:  WRE recommends against including UTF-8 chars 
in source code.

If that doesn't solve the problem, then it looks like an issue with 
Roxygen2.  I don't know if there's a way to tell it not to convert \u 
escapes into the corresponding character.  If there isn't, it seems like 
that's something they should add.  As a workaround, is there a way to 
say that this one particular .Rd file should be edited by hand, instead 
of auto-generated?

As I wrote previously the statement continues with
"Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the 
package obtains confirmation from the user."

I'm not a native speaker of English but for me "should not write" != 
"must not write".

>   I would fix the package.

I removed the automatic switch to "~/" if no path is given. As before I 
recommend in the man-pages to give the full path. However, I _still_ 
state that "~/" _can_ be used for convenience.
The package is used in a regulated environment. The output file contains 
an entire audit-trail (name of the user and system, version and date of 
the OS, R, all packages, functions used, time of execution, blablah). If 
the package would write to tempdir() I would have to add a warning in 
bold font of every man-page like "Execute the command tempdir() to find 
out where your result files reside. Copy the files to a safe location 
before you quit the R-session. If you fail to do so, your results will 
be lost."

Off topic: I don't like it that on Windows tempdir is located at 
"C:/Users/{Username}/AppData/Local/Temp/Rtmp..." I strictly separate my 
OSes (on C), software (on D), data (on E), backups (on F). Writing to 
the system disk is not what I prefer. However, in my installation "~/" 
resolves to "E:/Users/{Username}/Documents/"...

I don't think roxygen2 intentionally converts \u sequences, I think
this is just a consequence of the parse() + deparse() roundtrip:

x <- '"\\u03bc"'
charToRaw(x)
#>  [1] 22 5c 75 30 33 62 63 22
y <- deparse(eval(parse(text = x)))
charToRaw(y)
#> [1] 22 b5 22

Bill, please report a roxygen2 issue at
https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues and we can probably fix this.
Thanks!

Btw. you can possibly work around this by manually providing the

R-4.0 introduced a new function, tools::R_user_dir(package, which),
where which is one of "data", "config", and "cache".  It gives
standard directory names in which to place package-and-user-specific
files which you want to last longer than one R session.

I suppose you will still have to ask the user if it is ok to use those
directories, but you might want to put your log files in one of them
instead of in ~/ itself.

And "may be allowed" is not "will be allowed".

This is a little unclear (perhaps the language issue again).  It's fine 
if your documentation recommends the user choose that.  That's a 
variation on what I recommended to you (that you generate an error 
message that suggests how to avoid the error).

I don't agree with it if you mean to say the CRAN policy gets it wrong, 
and you should be allowed to have your original automatic fallback.

It can resolve anywhere you like (as long as its writable), by 
specifying the TMPDIR environment variable.

Yes, I've done that.

Agree. Though I can change it permanently in _my_ Rcmd_environ file, in 
a package I _must not_ change the users environment.

One (late) additional command:

in the following setup:

pdf("some_path")
plot(1)
dev.off()

if the plotting function fails, code execution stops and dev.off never gets called, leaving (potentially nested) devices open.

I suggest:

pdf("some_path")
on.exit(dev.off(), add=TRUE)
plot(1)


add=TRUE is technically only needed if you have several on.exit calls.
I trained myself to always include it after it bit me when I introduced more on.exit calls later on.

HTH,
Berry

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Warnings from gdal
Message-ID: <F289E8AA-BB76-420C-8966-11ACA83E47F1@noaa.gov>

I have a package on CRAN that  has a graphics component that calls a package that ultimately calls 'rgdal that CRAN is unhappy about.  'rgdal' now throws a warning if 'crs' is used,  and unless I am misreading the problems (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rerddapXtracto.html) that is what is causing the problems.  I am not certain that I can suppress warnings because it is from a package that calls a package (in this case raster) that calls rgdal.

Any advice appreciated, in particular if I am mis-reading the warning.

Thanks,

-Roy

Hope this helps.  I had a similar issue with my package.  Prior to the
recent change, GDAL did not throw a warning for empty (NA) CRS
strings. After change, it does.  projectRaster is throwing the warning
because it thinks input and output crs are the same (perhaps CRS is
missing?).  The purpose of projectRaster is to change crs's, so
identical crs's make little sense. I suggest making sure the input CRS
is valid (not NA) and that output CRS is different than the input.

Thanks.  What has made it really difficult is that devtools::check() runs fine on my Mac,  I installed Fedora on a virtual machine on my Mac,  devtools::check() also runs fine,  so it makes it really difficult to pin down things because I can't get into a debugger to see why CRAN is throwing errors, or more importantly if steps I have taken to correct the errors are working.  When I can't reproduce the warning it makes it very difficult.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] install.packages() seems not to select the latest
 suitable version
Message-ID: <7E6FCD0E-8690-4FA7-B66B-D1A0BF295DEF@stat.unipd.it>

When I updated package mnormt to version 2.0.0 in June (now at 2.0.1), 
at the stage of --as-cran checking, there was a compilation error,  
which was overcome by setting the 

Depends:	R (? 4.0.0)

With this option, all worked fine.

However, shortly afterwards, complaints started coming, 
either from users or from maintainers of packages making use of mnormt,
because this high version dependence causes troubles to some people,
such as those using Debian installations, currently at a much lower 
R version.

At the time I select that dependence value, I relied on the fact that
install.packages() selected the most recent suitable version of a package,
given the existing R installation. I expected that people without
R 4.0.0 would have the older version of mnormt, 1.5-7, installed.
As my memory goes (and the memory of other people too), this was 
the working in the past, but apparently not any more. 

For instance, this is a passage from a specific user:
 
"install.packages() used tp just install the most recent available 
for your current version of R.  In the past it might have done just that, 
but that's clearly not the case currently."

Can anyone clarify the reason of this (apparent? real?) change?
...and possibly indicate a way who people with lower R version (and perhaps
limited R expertise) can install the older version of mnormt, 1.5-7, 
without much hassle?

You can point those users to a) the r-sig-debian list and b) the Debian
directory at CRAN as we have always had "backports" of the current R to older
Debian releases---thanks to the work by Johannes Ranke "backporting" whatever
my current Debian packages of R are.

Moreover, you can also point them at `apt install r-cran-mnormt` -- I have
maintained your package within Debian since 2007 (!!) and continue to do so
giving Debian (and Ubuntu) users the choice between a distro binary and
installation from CRAN source.

I don't think that is quite correct. The CRAN repo is always set up for the
currently released version, and may allow constraints such 'R (>= 4.0.0)'
imposing the current (major) release.

There is no recent change in this behavior.

| "install.packages() used tp just install the most recent available

Yes and no. I don't think this correctly stated. `install.packages()` always
picks the most recent version, but this may also require running _the
current_ R release.  I disagree about "not the case currently" -- no change
as stated above.

"Versioned" installs were never supported by `install.packages()`.

But one could always download an older version to a local file, and point
install.packages() at that file (and setting 'repos=NULL'), or use `R CMD
INSTALL` directly. No change there either.

Hello everyone,

I've got at package on CRAN which uses C++17. Package is at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/image.binarization/index.html
The package fails on Solaris with the following message as my Makevars just contains CXX_STD = CXX17 indicating it requires C++17

* installing to library ?/home/ripley/R/Lib32?
* installing *source* package ?image.binarization? ...
** package ?image.binarization? successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
** using staged installation
** libs
Error: C++17 standard requested but CXX17 is not defined
* removing ?/home/ripley/R/Lib32/image.binarization?

real        1.0
user        0.7
sys         0.1

Looks like Solaris does not support C++17 yet. Is this error something that needs to be fixed by me? Will the package be removed from CRAN because of this. Any other people with C++17 code who can provide some advise.

best,
Jan

Dear R community,

in an effort to re-submit one of my packages (thurstonianIRT) to CRAN
because of some test failures after updates of other packages, I get the
following error from the CRAN debian installation, which I don't know how
to address:

* installing *source* package ?thurstonianIRT? ...
** using staged installation
** libs

It seems to be a problem with the V8 package (on which the latest version
of rstan depends) but I don't know if I can fix it from my side.

Many thanks for your advice
Paul

Tracing it:

  edd at rob:~$ locate libnode.so.64
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnode.so.64
  edd at rob:~$ dpkg -S $(locate libnode.so.64)
  libnode64:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnode.so.64
  edd at rob:~$ 

Looks like libnode64 needs to be installed. On systems that lack complete
dependency resolutions (cough, RSPM, cough) one needs libnode-dev; this
libnode64 above is dependency of libnode-dev.

Maybe you need to add 'libnode-dev' in SystemRequirements:  ?

Much simpler. On Debian the so number is now 72 and no longer 64, so CRAN
package V8 needs a simple rebuild to look for 72 and not the no-longer
existing 64. CC'ing Kurt Hornik.

I was, coincidentally, hitting the exact same issue on a Debian testing box
running reverse depends.

It's "the price we pay" by not having CRAN package tied to the system-level
dependencies which can at time also change.

Hi all,

I?m wondering if someone an offer advice on a problem I?m facing in developing a package.

My package essentially generates code and formats data for one of two MCMC sampling engines, JAGS accessed via rjags or nimble (a native R package), calls the engines, and then provides functions to access the results. Since only one of the engines is needed I would like to include rjags and nimble in Suggests in the DESCRIPTION and use requireNamespace() to load the appropriate package when its functionality is needed.

Unfortunately, nimble will not work with this mechanism. It relies on a complex mechanism to compile C++ code to run the sampler, and some of the functions cannot be found when the package is loaded in this way. I?ve been in touch with the maintainers and they are aware of the issue but the current fix is to include the package under Depends. However, this forces a user to install nimble (which itself requires compiling lengthy C++ code) even if the user intends to run the sampler in JAGS.

I thought I?d solved the problem by including nimble in Suggests and then loading it via library() so that all of its functions are attached. This works, but produces a note during the check:
? checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  'library' or 'require' call to ?nimble? in package code.
    Please use :: or requireNamespace() instead.
    See section 'Suggested packages' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual

What is the recommendation?

I see two options:


  1.  Include nimble in Depends and force user to install it.
  2.  Ignore the note and explain the problem when I resubmit to CRAN.

Am I missing anything?

Thanks in advance!

Simon

I think the key line = " Unfortunately, nimble will not work with this
mechanism. "

Given that, depends seems like a good short-term solution. Change it to
suggests once the upstream problem is fixed.

You might make a second package that depends only on nimble and your
main package can then suggest that second package and JAGS.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Documenting courtesy S3 methods
Message-ID: <CH2PR04MB6855A30C1C04E6891806A46DF1480@CH2PR04MB6855.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear package developers,

My package offers a few methods whose generics are in other packages; for example, 'cld', for which the generic is in the 'multcomp' package. Unless the user wants to use cld() (which I don't even encourage), they do not need the multcomp package to use other features of my package. Therefore, I do not want to import and re-export multcomp::cld. Instead, on loading my package, I dynamically register the method via RegisterS3Method() if the user's system happens to have multcomp installed; and if they don't, then they can still use my package, just not the cld method. this has worked well and keeps down the number of dependencies.

The problem is documenting it. I thought I had it solved by using this roxygen2 tag:

    #' @method multcomp::cld emmGrid

In turn, this tag generates these lines in the \usage section of my .Rd file:

    \method{multcomp::cld}{emmGrid}(object, details = FALSE, sort = TRUE, by,
      alpha = 0.05, Letters = c("1234567890", LETTERS, letters),
      reversed = FALSE, ...)

and the resulting help file looks like this:

    ## S3 method for class 'emmGrid'
    multcomp::cld(object, details = FALSE, sort = TRUE, by,
      alpha = 0.05, Letters = c("1234567890", LETTERS, letters),
      reversed = FALSE, ...)

This is exactly what I want. It tells the user clearly that if they want to use cld(), they have to have multcomp installed, and either name it explicitly in the call or have it in the search path.

No problems occur until I check the package, when I get this warning message:

    Bad \usage lines found in documentation object 'summary.emmGrid':
      <unescaped bksl>method{multcomp::cld}{emmGrid}(object, details = FALSE, sort = TRUE, by,
        alpha = 0.05, Letters = c("1234567890", LETTERS, letters),
        reversed = FALSE, ...)

Well I suppose this is "bad" as in unexpected; but it seems to be not bad in that it doesn't keep the help page from formatting correctly. And truly, I don't see how it could cause any harm. At lest the usage comes out correctly in both the HTML help and the PDF manual.

I can avoid the problem just by omitting "multcomp::". But then the user doesn't get such a clear message about how to use the function. 

I'm interested in suggestions, but again I would regard importing multcomp::cld as an unhelpful suggestion. We ought to be able to provide courtesy methods for generics in other packages (and this is not the only one in my package) without importing a whole bunch of unneeded stuff and doubling the number of required installations.

Thanks

From WRE:

"As from R 3.6.0 one can also use S3method() directives to perform
*delayed*registration.
With

if(getRversion() >= "3.6.0") {
    S3method(pkg::gen, cls)
}

function gen.cls will get registered as an S3 method for class cls and
generic gen from package pkg only when the namespace of pkg is loaded. This
can be employed to deal with situations where the method is not
?immediately? needed, and having to pre-load the namespace of pkg (and all
its strong dependencies) in order to perform immediate registration is
considered too onerous."

I understand the issue is documentation, but if you took this route, could
you not document your S3 method as usual without loading multcomp's (or
whatever) namespace. You could include a \note section in the doc saying
that the multcomp namespace must be explicitly loaded if your method is to
be used (perhaps showing the code to do so)

If I am clearly mistaken about this, feel free to dismiss without reply.

Dirk,

This sounds familiar: in package 'bit' for  

bit | bitwhich 

R did neither S3-dispatch to "|.bit" nor to "|.bitwhich" but nonsensically to the default method. 

It took me a while to reverse my class thinking enough to realize that I could get control by forcing dispatch to a common class 'booltype'.  So far this sounds harmless. But the truth is that to make this work 'booltype' must not be a common superclass but needs to be a subclass of 'bit' in bit-objects and needs to be a subclass of 'bitwhich' in bitwhich-objects. Only then the dispatch to "|.booltype" dominates and we get a seemingly conflict-free dispatch to "|.booltype" which then resolves possible conflicts. I hope using R's S3 class system upside-down does not introduce "another problem". Citing from "Beautiful Code":

"
it is worth bringing our discussion to an end by noting that Lampson attributes the aphorism that started our exploration (all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection) to David Wheeler, the inventor of the subroutine. Significantly, Wheeler completed his quote with another phrase: "But that usually will create another problem."
"

Best

Jens

Thanks, Bert. 

This looks potentially useful as an alternative to the way I currently dynamically register the method. It does seem to require that 'pkg' must actually be installed on the system in order to work, and that pkg would have to be listed in Import. I'd rather not force users to install packages they will never use. I am not sure of this requirement, but I'm sure I could verify it one way or the other using the checking system.

And yes, I could (and do) document within the Details and Examples (and could add a note as well) that users need to use multcomp::cld(). It just seems that actually showing that in the Usage section is by far the clearest way to communicate that requirement.

Testing results for Bert's suggestion...

I tested this with a different -- much smaller -- package: Put the S3method() construct in NAMESPACE but the generic package is not mentioned at all in any DESCRIPTION field. I built the package and checked it --as-cran. Interesting results:

  * Calling multcomp::cld(object) worked just fine without my doing anything to register the method. 
  * In checking, there was no objection to my not importing the generic for cld.

So this looks like a potentially good solution, except for the documentation issue.

BTW, note this parallel:

  * In NAMESPACE, the construct    S3method(pkg::gen, cls)
  * In Rd files, the macro    \S3method{pkg::gen}{cls}(args)

The latter is what I am asking about, that creates a warning. However, the parallel between these just cries out to be valid!

Probably unnecessary to say, but if/when you determine whether the package must be installed, let us all know.

Hi all,

Thanks for the suggestions and comments. I found a way to allow nimble to work and avoid the note when checking the package. My solution is to use:

requireNamespace(nimble)
attachNamespace("nimble")

I have a feeling that this may be against the spirit of the check (I believe that it essentially replicates library()), but it does allow nimble to find its own functions without any notes.

Cheers,

Simon

Dear all,

I'm struggling to understand this NOTE in 
r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang (only)
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_PowerTOST.html
emmeans is a great package (THX Russell!) but we don't use it anywhere 
in ours.

Only in two man pages we have
... obtained via \code{\link[emmeans]{emmeans}} of package \code{emmeans}.

Previously we had plain text and were asked by users for details.
AFAIK, this is the correct syntax acc. to the REM linking to the man 
page of another package. In the library links work as intended.

Our package is used in a regulated environment where even a NOTE raises 
eyebrows.
In all other R-versions and operating systems there is no problem. What 
surprises me is that on Fedora the results depends on the C-compiler. 
Strange.

Of course, we could use in NAMESPACE
 ? importFrom(emmeans, emmeans)
but that would force users to install a package they might not need at all.

If you want to link to a package in the documentation, you'll have to
add it to Suggests.

THX, will do. Is this documented somewhere? Any why don't the *other* 
installations of CRAN complain as well?

The check is documented in
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html
You can turn it on with the _R_CHECK_XREFS_PKGS_ARE_DECLARED_
environment variable.

I don't know if they run a different set of checks on purpose or by accident.

This doesn't make any sense.  If you don't use the code from that
package anywhere, then a cross-reference to that package should not
require the extra dependency in Suggests.  

Cross references should be able to point to other functionality that
might be useful to the user, or might add extra depth of understanding
to a concept.  If the user doesn't have the package installed, no
worries, it is just a cross reference.

The requirement you are suggesting is also not discussed in Writing R
Extensions:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-exts.html#Cross_002dreferences

In fact, it explicitly allows links to potentially uninstalled
packages.

Regards,

Brian

The whole point of the Suggests package relationship is that you don't actually have to have it installed to use the package. It does have to be installed to check the package, which allows the link to be tested at least once before being released.

You're reading the wrong version of the manual.  This is in the R-devel 
manual:

"Packages referred to by these ?other forms? should be declared in the 
DESCRIPTION file, in the ?Depends?, ?Imports?, ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields. "

This is at the end of section 2.5 in 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html.

I see. However, the HTML-source states
This manual is for R, version 4.1.0 Under development (2020-08-06).

I was relying on the PDF-version (4.0.2 of 2020-06-22) which does *not* 
contain this sentence. Hence, I fell into the trap. Should be stated in 
the PDF as well, IMHO.

Oh, c'mon.  It will be a new requirement in R 4.1.0  It's not a 
requirement in 4.0.2, and you didn't get a NOTE about it there, you only 
got the note in one of the r-devel platforms.

The general way things work in R is that changes get announced well in 
advance of release *by putting them in R-devel*.  That's why you're 
asked to check your package against R-devel before submitting:  so that 
it meets upcoming announced changes to requirements as well as ones that 
are in the current release.

Yep, but why are the others not configured in the same way (with setenv 
_R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_ false)? Doesn't sound consistent to me.

Of course, we checked the package on winbuilder... Are you suggesting to 
set up a multi-boot system for all those OSs? Even if one -- not us -- 
would aim at that: Where to get Solaris v10? Buy a Mac to run checks on 
maxOS?

At least I understand now the differences between 
r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc and r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc 
(given in the last line there: 
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rconfig/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc).

What has this got to do with your suggestion that changes that will be 
released in R 4.1.0 next year should be documented in R 4.0.2?

 ? I agree that package developers should always be reading the very 
most recent version of the docs. But I also agree that it gets confusing 
when the settings for different r-devel platforms on CRAN are 
different/inconsistent in ways that don't seem required by intrinsic 
between-platform differences ...

With "R Under development (unstable) (2020-07-05 r78784)" (Windows) documentation references such as "\link[utils]{dump.frames}" trigger "Non-file package-anchored link(s) in documentation object" warnings even if the package is in your "Imports."

Is that not the right form? Is there any way to fix this other than the workaround of just removing links from the documentation? I kind of don't want to do that as the links were there to help the user.

This might have to be \link[utils:debugger]{dump.frames} now, i.e.
explicitly linking to the man page on which dump.frames is found
rather than following aliases?

Thanks Ben!

I'll see if that style change works for me.

It's always had to be that way for reliable links.  It's just that the 
QC checks are finally warning about the unreliability.

Firstly: thanks to Ben for the help/fix.

I know nobody asked, but.

Having to guess where the documentation is just to refer to it is just going to be really brittle going forward. Previous: if the function you referred to existed in the package you were fine. Future: if don't correctly specify where the help is you are wrong. Going forward: reorganizing a package's help can break referring packages. This sort of brittleness is going to be a big time-waster going forward. It seems like really the wrong direction in packaging, isolation, and separation of concerns (SOLID style principles).

That's not correct.  The system could often work around the error, but 
not always.

 ? I may be missing something. It may well be that referring to a 
cross-package link by alias rather than by the name of the Rd page 
actually never worked, but: would there be a big barrier to making 
cross-package documentation links be able to follow aliases? I can 
imagine there may be technical hurdles but it seems like a well-defined 
problem ...

To link to "?utils::dump.frames", you need to construct a URL that leads 
to the HTML file containing that help page on static builds of the help 
system.

If utils is available, no problem, just look up the fact that the page 
you want is debugger.html at the time you construct the link.  But it 
was documented that such links should work even if the target package 
was not available at the time the link was being made.  So you need a 
link that you are sure will be available when the referenced package is 
eventually installed.  Obviously that's going to be brittle.

Perhaps the new requirement that referenced packages be mentioned in the 
DESCRIPTION file is a step towards addressing this.  If everything 
that's referenced is present when the help system is being built, there 
will be an easy solution.

Nowadays, it would probably be reasonable to put in stub pages for every 
alias, so that when you try to load dump.frames.html, the page itself 
redirects you to debugger.html.  Or maybe you could just have a single 
page in each package that handles aliases via Javascript.

Or R could just no longer support static copies of the help system.

When you are using dynamically generated help pages, the link can be 
resolved by the server, and that's why those links have appeared to work 
for so long, even though the requirement to link to the filename instead 
of the alias has been there since before I wrote the dynamic help server.

These recently introduced 'R CMD check' WARNINGs were disabled again
in R-devel on July 8, 2020:

r78793: https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/ccd903e47ab42e1c181396256aea56454a2e70c9
r78794: https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/b70f90ae11dd516c1c954ed15eb5a7c2a304b37f

This is because there's a plan to add support for what we're all
asking for in one way or the other. That's all I know.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] WARNING: A complete check needs the 'checkbashisms'
 script.
Message-ID: <CAEp5mpAywq7SFwfHBeTBGUOp_40X7aBuj_CasG8AgkBQvmL6zA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R-pkg-devel,

My package

https://github.com/knausb/vcfR

has been archived on CRAN because I was asked by CRAN to address issues
that I was unable to address before the deadline I was given. The issue I'm
struggling with is that when I use

```
R CMD check --as-cran vcfR_1.12.0.tar.gz
```

I get

```
* checking top-level files ... WARNING
A complete check needs the 'checkbashisms' script.
See section ?Configure and cleanup? in the ?Writing R Extensions?
manual..
```
.

Dirk Eddelbeuttel has proposed a solution on SO. (Thank you again Dirk!)

```
https://stackoverflow.com/a/62721142
```

I've implemented this change, but I am concerned that it won't be accepted
by CRAN. My concern is that this works on my local machines (Ubuntu and
MacOS), where I can install checkbashisms, but I can't control whether
checkbashisms is installed on CRAN machines or on user machines. This means
it will generate a WARNING on machines where checkbashisms is not
installed. Most of me feels that I need to address this somehow. But I do
not know how. Part of me is wondering if I should expect users to manage
this. Any help would be appreciated!

Thank you!
Brian (knausb)

Hi Brian,

The checkbashisms script is invoked by the R checks automatically:

https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/library/tools/R/check.R#L1216-L1267

Thus there shouldn't be any need for you to invoke it manually in your 
configure script, even less so to worry about its presence. You can 
still install it locally so the R checks can proceed without the warning 
(or set _R_CHECK_BASHISMS_ to FALSE to skip that particular check, again 
locally), but that shouldn't be a problem in CRAN, as it should be 
installed there already.

Cheers,

Rodrigo

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Conditional linking in Makevars
Message-ID: <de8907ebd3f6ee7b130220b99956933746b01d0a.camel@gmail.com>

I am having issues with undefined compiler symbols in a package with C
code that I recently updated:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang/poismf-00install.html
The issue seems to be connected with usage of OpenMP, and happens only
when compiling with clang:
?Error: package or namespace load failed for 'poismf' in dyn.load(file,
DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-devel-
clang/Work/build/Packages/00LOCK-poismf/00new/poismf/libs/poismf.so':
  /home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-devel-clang/Work/build/Packages/00LOCK-
poismf/00new/poismf/libs/poismf.so: undefined symbol:
__atomic_compare_exchange?


Prof. Ripley left the following comment:
?I don't know what makes your use of OpenMP uniquely different but
when 
using clang you need to include -latomic in the link (where it exists, 
as it does on Linux and probably on FreeBSD).?

I am wondering if it is somehow possible to add conditional link
arguments in a Makevars file depending on the user?s operating system,
or if not possible, whether it would somehow hurt in windows/mac
installations to add a raw -latomic in there.


Best regards,
David Cortes

Thank you Dirk "Eddelbuettel" (apologies for my spelling, it's your name,
so I should be able to spell it correctly, particularly if I'm asking you
for help) and Rodrigo Tobar for the responses! It sounds like I've gone
down a rabbit hole that I should not have.

When I omit ```configure``` (in my case it only includes this call to
```checkbashisms```) I build with no ERRORs or WARNINGs on Ubuntu 18.0.4
and R 4.0.2 with ```checkbashisms``` installed. When I build on macos
10.15.6 and R 4.0.2 without ```checkbashisms``` installed I throw the
previously reported WARNING (when using --as-cran but not when I omit this
flag). I feel I need to address this because it is a WARNING. It sounds
like I can assume that CRAN machines will have ```checkbashisms```
installed where necessary and handle this appropriately when not? And that
users will not try to use R CMD check --as-cran? Suspecting like I'm trying
too hard now. But also feeling like I've been down this path with CRAN
already and am trying to respect their time.

Thanks!
Brian

That's my reading, yes.

I don't think you need to handle this at all. As you experimented, 
simply removing your otherwise empty configure script should suffice.

Note that by default (i.e., without --as-cran) the check is not 
included. The documentation for _R_CHECK_BASHISMS_ reads "... Default: 
false (but true for CRAN submission checks except on Windows).". Adding 
--as-cran effectively turns that check on.

Having said that, users can still run checks with --as-cran, but they 
would need to be aware that it requires certain infrastructure to run 
those checks. That's true for all packages though, not only yours, so I 
don't think you need to specially worry about it.

Cheers,

Rodrigo

Thank you again for your responses Rodrigo Tobar. I'm happy to call this a
solution. I've got some testing to do but I'm hoping to get this sent back
to CRAN soon.

Thank you for your help!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Etiquette for package submissions that do not
 automatically pass checks?
Message-ID: <fd761a57-9ec5-6f89-a151-80b2af2d905c@hum.leidenuniv.nl>

A while ago, I submitted an update to my package 'buildmer' that does not pass R CMD check. This is deliberate. The package contains functionality to run on cluster nodes that were set up by the user and needs to access its own internal functions from there. In previous versions of the package, I had maintained a list of those functions and clusterExport()ed them, but that had the side effect of overwriting any same-named user objects on the user-provided cluster nodes, which I thought was poor form. The update therefore accesses these functions using ':::', which triggers a check warning.

I thought the etiquette was to explain this in the 'Comments' box when submitting, but this gave me the same automated message that the package does not pass checks and that I should fix it or reply-all and explain. This led me to believe that I should not have used the 'Comments' box for this purpose, hence I resubmitted the package leaving the comments box empty, and I replied-all to the subsequent e-mail I got with an explanation similar to the above.

It has now been a while since I sent that e-mail (ten days), and I have yet to hear back. I was wondering if the message had gotten lost, if they simply haven't gotten around to it yet (I have no idea how much mail they receive on a daily basis, but I'd think it's a lot more than I do), or if I should have handled this differently. Only CRAN can answer the first two questions, but before I bother them: was this the correct procedure, or should I simply have done something differently?

Thanks,
Cesko

It seems to me that what you should have done is "reply-all and 
explain", as the automated message said.

You can see the state of your submission using the foghorn package. 
cran_incoming("buildmer") currently shows your package is in the 
"archive", which means "package rejected: it does not pass the checks 
cleanly and the problems are unlikely to be false positives".

I only see version 1.7 there, which may indicate that you resubmitted 
exactly the same package (down to the version number).  As the 
instructions at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#Re_002dsubmission 
say, "Increasing the version number at each submission reduces confusion 
so is preferred even when a previous submission was not accepted."

What I'd suggest now is that you do nothing more for a day or two, 
because CRAN members who aren't on holiday might read and respond to 
your message.  If you don't hear anything, then I'd start over again, 
with a new version number, and an explanation in the comments, and 
likely a followup reply-all.

Alternatively, you could export those troublesome functions from your 
package but document them as for internal use only.  Renaming them with 
a name starting with "." will make them harder for users to stumble 
upon, but you can still access them using buildmer::.something, you 
shouldn't need clusterExport(). Then you will meet the technical 
requirement and not need any explanation.

You have more than a few days.  As it says on CRAN:
"CRAN submission is offline from Aug 14 to Aug 24, 2020 (CRAN team
vacation and maintainance work)"

Duncan, Joshua,

Thanks for the feedback. I had indeed forgotten to increment the version number, so that may explain it. I'll give it until a few days after the 24th, and then just resubmit with a new version number.

Also, thanks for introducing me to the foghorn package, I wasn't aware of it before.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to retrieve a flag set in configure.ac (filled in
 Makevars.in) during package installation in an R or C++ script ?
Message-ID: <CAJ=u__OOabSyH-+kbgF+wkRCbge8RtvZ2OspSynSx5cfj9XCdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Background:

The package rminizinc <https://github.com/acharaakshit/RMiniZinc> provides
an interface to MiniZinc
<https://www.minizinc.org/tutorial/minizinc-tute.pdf> in R. The package
provides various functionalities to parse, solve and manipulate MiniZinc
models. This is done by using the MiniZinc C++ API (libminizinc
<https://github.com/MiniZinc/libminizinc>).

The installation requires linking of the library an including the header
files for which PKG_LIBS flag(-L/path/to/libminizinc -lmzn) , and
PKG_CPPFLAGS (-I/path/to/libminizinc/include) are filled in Makevars.in
which is set by configure based on the path of the library provided by the
user using --configure-args or if the user doesn't provide any arguments, a
default path is passed from configure (using configure.ac).

Question:

In one of my Rcpp functions mzn_parse() which is used to parse MiniZinc
models, I sometimes need to use the files in the subdirectories of the
libminizinc library. To access these files, I need to use the path of
libminizinc (which can change per installation). I want to extract this
path from either Makevars or configure to use it in my package. Is there
any way I could retrieve this path in my scripts?

Please let me know if this question is not relevant to the mailing list.

The Makevars.in looks like this:

CXX_STD = CXX11
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I. @MZN_INCLUDE@
PKG_LIBS = @MZN_LIBS@
OBJECTS.tests = cpp_tests/test-runner.o cpp_tests/test-mzn_parse.o
cpp_tests/test-
set_params.o cpp_tests/test-mzn_eval.o cpp_tests/test-sol_parse.o
cpp_tests/test-
getMissingPars.o
OBJECTS.sources = RcppExports.o set_params.o mzn_parse.o mzn_eval.o sol_parse.o
getMissingPars.o
OBJECTS.helpers = filetoString.o helper_parse.o expDetails.o pathStringcheck.o
OBJECTS = $(OBJECTS.sources) $(OBJECTS.tests) $(OBJECTS.helpers)
$(SOURCES:.cpp=.o)
strippedLib: $(SHLIB)
    if test -e "/usr/bin/strip"; then /usr/bin/strip --strip-debug
$(SHLIB); fi.phony: strippedLib
all: clean
clean:
    rm -f $(OBJECTS.sources) $(OBJECTS.tests) $(OBJECTS.helpers)  *.so

Thanks!

Dear Akshit,

in the configure script of my package RcppCWB, I use the command line call 'R CMD config ...' to get the installation flags. 

Calling 'R CMD config' will display options. For your scenario, you can use 'R CMD config CPPFLAGS' to get the value of CPPFLAGS. 

To call R CMD config safely, you will need to prepend $R_HOME/bin. In the configure script of RcppCWB, I need to detect the compiler used and I do it using this snippet:
CC_R=`$R_HOME/bin/R CMD config CC`

More experienced people following R-package-devel than myself may be aware of a better solution, and I would also be happy to learn about it.

Kind regards
Andreas

Apologies for derailing the thread, but I had a similar problem a few
months ago [*], found what looks like a different solution but did not
have time to investigate it further.

Given that serialize() does not send package namespaces over the wire
[**], why would it be a bad idea to pass actual functions (instead of
character strings naming functions) to parallel::parLapply and friends?
This seems to avoid the need to export the worker functions or use :::
in calls to parallel functions from package functions. Unless I am
missing something, which I probably am.

Dear Andreas,

Thanks for your answer!

I also got an answer from Rcpp-devel list by Nik Pocuca. He suggested me to
create an .RData or .rda file
(say config.RData) in the data folder of my package and then execute the
statement given below in Makevars.in
to save the flag in the .RData file.
$(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript -e "LIBMINIZINC_PATH <- '@MZN_LIBS@';
save(LIBMINIZINC_PATH, file='../data/config.RData')"

This way the flag would be saved in the data file. Then in the script I
call data("config") and the LIBMINIZINC_PATH flag is
loaded in the global environment from where I can access and use it. I am
currently using this solution and haven't faced
any issues.

Thanks,
Akshit

Just as Makevars is generated during ./configure run from Makefile.in,
you could generate a config.h from a config.h.in and substitute all the
necessary #defines in it. This is how GNU autoconf is typically used in
stand-alone programs [*].

A simpler option would be to add an equivalent of
-DMZN_PATH='"@MZN_PATH"' to PKG_CPPFLAGS in Makevars.in and make sure
that AC_SUBST is called for that variable in configure.ac [**]. Then
the C or C++ code would be able to use MZN_PATH as if it was #defined
in a header file.

.Rbuildignore is not documented [1] to allow comments, but the
current implementation does skip empty lines [2] since 2010 [3]
(otherwise empty regular expressions would match all file names).

It could be possible to get away with comment lines, since the
resulting regular expressions are unlikely to ever match anything, but
it would cost CPU cycles to match every file name against every
regular expression, and some regular expressions may turn out to be
really expensive on some inputs [4].

I think that it's best not to try to add comments to .Rbuildignore, and
to avoid blank lines unless not having them becomes really inconvenient.

I just tried this out with R-4.0.2 on Linux and it looks like
.Rbuildignore does not treat lines with '#'s as comments.  E.g.,

% mkdir test test/inst
% touch 'test/inst/#octothorp.txt' 'test/inst/normal.txt'
% echo > test/DESCRIPTION 'Package: test\nVersion: 0.1\nTitle:
test\nDescription: A test of .Rbuildignore'
% touch test/NAMESPACE
% R CMD build test > /dev/null

% tar ztf test_0.1.tar.gz | grep '\.txt$'
test/inst/#octothorp.txt
test/inst/normal.txt
% echo '#.*[.]txt' > test/.Rbuildignore
% R CMD build test > /dev/null

Thanks for the feedback. It seems like I was under the impression that
.Rbuildignore would follow similar rules as .gitignore.

No worries, these issues are also what this mailing list is for! I've meanwhile heard back from Uwe that I should resubmit after the 24th, and that he still would like the warning to go away. Your suggestion certainly makes sense, but it would require a rewrite of some delicate parts. Fortunately, I was already passing a parameter list around anyway, so I can just add those functions in that list, and I'll probably end up indeed taking that approach. Thank you for the suggestion! It does feel like an awful hack, though, given that the language supports doing this in a clean way using the ::: operator. But I also understand that CRAN want to impose certain limitations to discourage bad practices, and I trust their judgment that ::: is one of those.

Best,
Cesko

This is for `install.libs.R`, but AFAIR it is also true for `configure`. So
you need the `R_PACKAGE_DIR` env var.

Nice. An alternate approach I have used is to call

    $(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript -e 'cat(.libPaths()[1])'

from configure but Gabor's approach saves a process.

But R_PACKAGE_DIR contains the temporary path for staged
installations. Instead, I think R_LIBRARY_DIR is the desired path.

I defined mu submodules to uses a specific commit, not the master.

I tried to used args="--recursive" but the same problem is still occurring.

 optimally eligible for CRAN
Message-ID: <1598260970191.21076.170832@webmail6>

Dear fellow package developers,

I send this email for advice whether if I should submit a package to CRAN.

I have written a GPL-3 licensed package, that allows one to install and use a command-line tool. This command-line tool, however, has a restriction: it is to be used by academics only. To be able to actually install it, there is a web form to request a download URL (valid for 4 hours). After confirmation of being an academic, one receives this URL by email.


I feel the package on its own is useful enough to be put on CRAN. It 'R CMD check's cleanly without the install, yet if helps the install the command-line tool from the emailed URL (see <https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/netmhc2pan#install> ).
Should I submit my package to CRAN?

Thanks for your advice, Richel Bilderbeek

Dear Mac users,

Can someone of you identify the cause of the problem in

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-oldrel-macos-x86_64/ff-00check.html

I can't because I don't have access to a Mac.

It seems that gc() after rm(ffobject) does not remove the ff file in rows

(@test-zero_lengths.R#34)
(@test-zero_lengths.R#35)
(@test-zero_lengths.R#63)
(@test-zero_lengths.R#64)

so maybe the finalizer is not triggered? Does delete(ffobject) work?

Kind regards


Jens

Message-ID: <3C0F7C1B-8102-4D0C-B577-AC326F1E15DB@ic.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I am reaching out to seeking help in debugging my package.
The package has been already on CRAN for some time, updated twice. Also, I have been checking the package regularly on rhub, since my last submission to CRAN, with no errors.

However, recently last checks on rhub end with a segmentation fault for the following platform:
Platform:       Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran

From the error log below it seems that the error happens after running the examples:

Is this reproducible on R-hub? Do you see it with the other R-devel
containers as well?

Some things to try:

Try running address sanitizer on your package to see if it can find
any memory errors. You can do this on R-hub as well, if you cannot do
it on your machine.

Try downloading the https://hub.docker.com/r/rhub/fedora-clang-devel
Docker container and reproduce this locally.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error in winbuilder
Message-ID: <CACrL82WYooy2hM5KAfkUfoYJ721bQWN0OPgOG94ZocgHLdsg7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I have an error when submitting to Winbuilder for my R package, naniar
<https://github.com/njtierney/naniar>.

When using `devtools::check_win_devel()` or `devtools::check_win_release()`
on naniar, I get the following logfile from winbuilder:

```
* using log directory 'd:/RCompile/CRANguest/R-release/naniar.Rcheck'
* using R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)
* using platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit)
* using session charset: ISO8859-1
* checking for file 'naniar/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
* checking extension type ... Package
* this is package 'naniar' version '0.5.3'
* package encoding: UTF-8
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... ERROR
Check process probably crashed or hung up for 20 minutes ... killed
Most likely this happened in the example checks (?),
if not, ignore the following last lines of example output:

======== End of example output (where/before crash/hang up occured ?)
========
```

(submission URL here: https://win-builder.r-project.org/77PYyM2kMri1/)

I had previously thought this was a problem to do with CRAN being closed
last week, but apparently this is not the case, and it should have been
working. I cannot find any details on CRAN for this, but it passes build on
R HUB for windows, and it passes build with no warnings, errors, or notes
for me on Mac OSX, as well as on github actions (windows, macOS, and
ubuntu).

Just wondering if anyone has thoughts on this? I have also cross
posted on Rstudio
community
<
https://community.rstudio.com/t/winbuilder-error-check-process-probably-crashed-or-hung-up-for-20-minutes-killed/77492
>,
in case that is of interest.

Thanks for your time, and apologies if I have missed something obvious.

All the best,

Nick

Message-ID: <CAKw8BGJguhq20+UT-1+y0gCW5XPhCL2LOe-hAU5FbSULoghpWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I cannot get my package to correctly build on Windows because of an
encoding error that I just can't figure out. The package builds on my Mac
(10.14.6) and on a recent Debian release.

The source code for the package can be viewed here:
https://github.com/JHarrisonEcoEvo/CNVRG

The error code thrown by the "check_win_release" function of devtools is:

* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING
LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
LaTeX errors found:
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char ? (U+2010)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char ? (U+2010)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
* checking PDF version of manual without hyperrefs or index ... ERROR
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... OK
* DONE
Status: 1 ERROR, 1 WARNING, 1 NOTE

FYI the note referenced is because the package is a new submission.

I figured the problem was with hyphens (the unicode 2010) and so I went
through the manual and vignette and deleted all the hyphens in the regular
text. There are still hyphen symbols in the assignment operator of the
examples ("<-"). Are these the problem?

I have spent way too much time trying to figure this out so any help would
be greatly appreciated. I see that many folks have similar issues with
vignettes and manuals but I haven't found a solution that works for me.

I am completely fine not having the package build on Windows. Users of that
system can download the manual or view it in a browser. However, I don't
see how I can get the package on CRAN without fixing this.

Thanks for your time and assistance!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] url checks not working for me
Message-ID: <CALnEB14VV2weCWkLNpw3SGK3uO-QYzMSJjDM0gNj3M5HCmrr7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
URL errors in my DESCRIPTION file and package vignette are not picked up
when I do R CMD check --as-cran or devtools::check(). I only know about
these errors because CRAN has rejected my package submission and instructed
me to fix the urls (example at end of this message).

I am trying to figure out how I can get R CMD check --as-cran to detect
these URL mistakes. From
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/URL_checks.html I understand that I
need libcurl installed, which I have.

Can anyone tell me whether I am using the wrong combination of libcurl
version, R version, and Ubuntu version? (see versions below). If not, what
else can I do to get the URL checks to work?

Thanks, Vincent

At the minimum you should look at the ?moved to? URLs and change your links to those (some are outright changes in URLs that were redirected and some are http to https changes).

Addressing the errors is not the problem. I want to be able to detect these
problems when I do: R CMD check --as-cran.
At the moment, I can only detect the errors by submitting the package to
CRAN, because only their package check triggers these errors.

Dear Nicholas

Do you in fact have many examples in the package? Perhaps for some 
mysterious reason they take longer there than when you check at home.

The win-builder system will also detect them.

These checks trigger for me on your package.

You cannot :-/. I pointed that out to CRAN maintainers a few times myself.

Apparently we are supposed to find that in the generated ${package}.Rcheck
directory even when no warning was issued. Supposedly one has to live in
Auckland, Dortmund, Oxford or Vienna to find that normal.

Sorry, I was reading too fast.  One possibility is your R version is wee bit old.  Try a more recently daily build.

I recently saw such errors when submitting to Win-Builder, but was fine locally (per your situation).

Hi Michael,

I do indeed have quite a few examples in the package, this hasn't been a
problem in the past, but I guess I could try reducing them down. Have you
had this problem before?

Cheers,

Nick

Friends, thias looks like a hang in the CRAN incoming feasibility 
checks, hence may well be some web related issue as it seems it ran into 
the timeout there.

Hi Uwe,

OK thank you for that, good to know! I imagine it might be a bit tricky to
know when, but do you have an idea of when submissions might return to
normal? Or should I be good to submit again soon?

Thanks again,

Nick

Ok, Uwe was kind enough to take me to task off-list and I can now confirm
that I _can_ replicate the URL issue locally by ensuring all three of

 - recent enough r-devel build (that was true, I may add that the
   rocker/r-devel and rocker/drd containers I look after can help)

 - built with libcurl support so check capabilities()[["libcurl"]] (that was
   also true for me)

 - CRAN incoming checks turned on (and that was my issue)

One way to ensure the last point is to have a file

  ~/.R/check.Renviron-Rdevel

which I had (but where I had commented out 'incoming' as it can take a
moment).  Current values below, with thanks to Uwe for the reminder.

I reiterate that this really should be part of R CMD check --as-cran.  Maybe
one day it will be.

And I forgot to add them.  This time.  One of the values is local to my
R-devel build.  I am sure Henrik will follow-up soon with an extended list :)

Hyphens that, e.g., get auto generated in MS Word are non ASCII. You 
have to declare an appropriate encoding, or even better, replace by 
regular hypehsn.

See functions

tools:::showNonASCII     tools:::showNonASCIIfile

that may help to see where these are...

Hi Uwe,

Thanks for the response and for mentioning the 'tools::' functions. Those
functions were super helpful in identifying a hyphen that I missed in a
supporting file that roxygen used to build the manual.

My package builds without warnings and errors now on a few systems, so I
think I am good to go. Thanks again.

Hi,

I submitted a package, "PhysActBedRest" to the CRAN a couple of years ago and am trying to update it.  In writing the update, I realized I forgot to update my email address when I changed institutions.  As a consequence, when I run CMD check on the updated package there is a NOTE that the maintainer has changed.  How to I get my update to pass the check and correct my email address?

Thanks,
Dustin

Message-ID: <b2489dda-5e8a-6b30-4152-0b0d16712a4b@mcmaster.ca>

Dear r-package-devel list members,

I got the following note when checking two different packages today 
--as-cran, both under R 4.0.2 and under R-devel, on my Windows 10 and 
macOS Catalina systems, and on several platforms on rhub:

	* checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
unable to verify current time

I'm writing to inquire about the note because no one else has mentioned 
this problem recently, in case it's produced by something that I'm 
doing. There is a discussion of a similar problem from 2019 at 
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2019q1/003577.html>.

Both packages that I was checking are close to CRAN releases and so I'd 
like to know whether I can disregard the note.

Any help would be appreciated.

John

Dear Josef

 From the policy

Explain any change in the maintainer?s email address and if possible 
send confirmation from the previous address (by a separate email to 
CRAN-submissions at R-project.org) or explain why it is not possible.

Burned into my cortex since I did it incorrectly a few years back.

R tries to get the time from

http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/UTC or
http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/utc/now

The first one doesn't accept UTC as a timezone; it appears to want 
etc/UTC instead.  The second one is offline.

Duncan Murdoch

If both of those fail, you'll get the message you saw.

  It seems to have gotten worse at the moment (package checking on my 
local machine hangs at this step).  Sorry if this is cross-threading.

I didn't -- I just disregarded the note assuming that it would go away 
when the time server was back up.

(I've cc'd the R-package-devel list so that others can see your question 
and my response.)

Message-ID: <1598946197192.22292.40366@webmail3>

Dear fellow R package maintainers,

I would enjoy your advice to clarify a CRAN policy issue.

The question is: should a package be able to work, when calling its exported functions using the scope operator? Or, in the example code below, should #1 work?



```
# 1. Scope operator: should this always work?
mypackage::myfunction()

# Possible error message:
# Error in myfunction() :
# object 'myhiddenfunction' of mode 'function' was not found


# 2. Calling library first
library(mypackage)
myfunction()
```

I feel the answer is 'yes, #1 should work', as I feel this is only indirectly a CRAN repository policy [1] , the IMHO relevant one which I quote: 'Packages should not modify the global environment (user?s workspace).'. This means that if I have a function that calls `mypackage::myfunction`, it will call `library`:


```
#' Function in another package, that depends on my package
do_something <- function() {
library(mypackage)
myfunction()
}
```

So, should a package be able to work, when calling its exported functions using the scope operator?

Thanks for your advice/pointers, Richel Bilderbeek

Yes.

Yes.

This means that if I have a function that calls `mypackage::myfunction`, it will call `library`:

No, it can import from the namespace, i.e. it loads the package, but 
does not modify the search path (i.e. does not attach the package).

Also note the workspace (=.GlobalEnv) is not the search path.

Hi,

Hi Matt,


If you scroll down just below the Windows and Debian OKs, you'll see these lines:


Last released version's CRAN status: ERROR: 1, WARN: 3, NOTE: 1, OK: 7
See: <https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/checks/check_results_modeltime.html

It seems one of your vignettes is causing issues when trying to use phantomJS.

Hi all,

All checks for my updated package seem to be all fine except for  r-release-macos-x86_64 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html#r-release-macos-x86_64> .
KEGGgraph a bio conductor package is required for my package to run but is not available on the platform.

It is however available on the devel version.
Full log below:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-x86_64/iCARH-00check.html

Does this mean the package might be removed from CRAN?

Thanks in advance,
bw,

That message is about the version that's on CRAN, not the new 
submission.  I think Matt should just follow this directions:  "If you 
are fairly certain the rejection is a false positive, please reply-all 
to this message and explain."  Having OK results rejected sure seems 
like a false positive!

Hi Max,

I appreciate the quick response - The webshot should no longer be an issue.
My latest submission has only one vignette and I switched all of the plots
from interactive (which uses webshot to convert to PNG) to ggplot2 so
webshot should not be necessary.

I think the CRAN Modeltime 0.2.0 results should be corrected. The only one
I see that may still be an issue is the prophet library, which modeltime
uses.

What do you think?

Hi Matt,


If you addressed the issues with the current CRAN version, then I would go with Duncan's suggestion below and treat this as a false positive.


Best,

Hi Max,

I appreciate the quick response - The webshot should no longer be an issue. My latest submission has only one vignette and I switched all of the plots from interactive (which uses webshot to convert to PNG) to ggplot2 so webshot should not be necessary.

I think the CRAN Modeltime 0.2.0 results should be corrected. The only one I see that may still be an issue is the prophet library, which modeltime uses.

What do you think?

That message is about the version that's on CRAN, not the new
submission.  I think Matt should just follow this directions:  "If you
are fairly certain the rejection is a false positive, please reply-all
to this message and explain."  Having OK results rejected sure seems
like a false positive!

Here is the build report for KEGGgraph

http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGgraph.html

where it builds, and is available, across all platforms. This does not seem to be a Bioconductor problem, but rather a CRAN configuration issue.

    KEGGgraph a bio conductor package is required for my package to run but is not available on the platform.

    Does this mean the package might be removed from CRAN?

I've received a notification of errors from CRAN on some package (zen4R) 
recently updated, being asked to fix within the 2 weeks before archiving.

The error deals with 'keyring' package import at test time, on _Fedora_ 
flavors only.

See https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_zen4R.html 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_zen4R.html>

I'm not running this OS so I used the R-hub package builder 
(https://builder.r-hub.io/advanced <https://builder.r-hub.io/advanced>) 
to re-test on these flavors:

 ??? - Fedora Linux, R-devel, GCC : 
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/zen4R_0.4.tar.gz-8031e4afba828ef9d3f7933b7231207e 
<https://builder.r-hub.io/status/zen4R_0.4.tar.gz-8031e4afba828ef9d3f7933b7231207e>

 ??? - Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran: 
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/zen4R_0.4.tar.gz-5fc1d63c756b7c4b650da06ed87f7c35 
<https://builder.r-hub.io/status/zen4R_0.4.tar.gz-5fc1d63c756b7c4b650da06ed87f7c35>

On both, status is OK, so I still wonder why I get these errors on CRAN,

Your advice in order to solve that would be much appreciated,

Thanks a lot

Emmanuel

Life, as they say, "is too short" so you could just comment-out the test.

Indeed, it is probably best not to run this test on CRAN's machines.

It probably fails because CRAN's keyring package is built without the
OS's keyring library, at least on Fedora.

But really, ideally you would not access the OS keyring in test cases,
except when running on a CI, or on the developers' machines.

Thanks both for your quick answers,

I've implemented a solution to avoid the keyring issue by handling 
properly the error, and catch it properly in test-all.R (as a better 
control to deactivate CI integration tests if Zenodo token is invalid - 
which is the case on CRAN).

https://github.com/eblondel/zen4R/commit/ff3c34a20b486e547bbc684a696cfe15eb8c37bd 
<https://github.com/eblondel/zen4R/commit/ff3c34a20b486e547bbc684a696cfe15eb8c37bd>

zen4R has been resubmitted and Fedora CRAN builds are fine now.

Hi, I've one note in my package which I can't seem to resolve while
submitting to CRAN:

  New submission

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: R code for possible problems, Result: NOTE
  Possibly missing '()' after 'return' in the following functions:
    'asymptoticMemoryUsage' 'asymptoticTimings'


There are opening and closing brackets with the return statement to the
functions already. The source code can be found here:
asymptoticTimings:
https://github.com/Anirban166/testComplexity/blob/master/R/asymptoticTimings.R
asymptoticMemoryUsage:
https://github.com/Anirban166/testComplexity/blob/master/R/asymptoticMemoryUsage.R


The note seems trivial but I can't seem to get rid of it. Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Anirban

`return()` is a function in R, so `return` does nothing. You probably
want `return()`.

Hi Anirban,

I don't think the issue is coming from the return statement at the end of your function. I think it's triggered by your "ifelse" statement, where you have "return" as the expression to be run if the condition isn't met.

A more idiomatic way of achieving what you're trying to do would be to use "stopifnot".

Best,

Thank you for the helpful replies! I got it now, I overlooked the return on
the ifelse() before.

Message-ID: <CAJbAZz6P1qn8b8H+4WUzp--Y9hm8zj==VCt1nzEhxLt7kzoWAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all. I am developing a package that includes some global variables.
Because these are non-ASCII, I have escaped them. But then because these
are difficult to read, I want to provide an easy way for users to unescape
all of them up front. Thus I have code like to create and save the data in
global variables in one file:

pali_vowels <-
  c("a", "\u0101", "i", "\u012b", "u", "\u016b", "e", "o")
pali_consonants <-
  c("k", "kh", "g", "gh", "\u1e45",
    "c", "ch", "j", "jh", "\u00f1",
    "\u1e6d", "\u1e6dh", "\u1e0d", "\u1e0dh", "\u1e47",
    "t", "th", "d", "dh", "n",
    "p", "ph", "b", "bh", "m",
    "y", "r", "l", "v", "s", "h", "\u1e37", "\u1e43")
pali_alphabet <-c(pali_vowels, pali_consonants)
use_data(pali_alphabet, overwrite = TRUE)

and then I try to export a function like this in another file:

pali_string_fix <- function() {
  pali_alphabet <<-
     stringi::stri_unescape_unicode(pali_alphabet)
  # Several more of these...
  }

The idea is that users can run pali_string_fix() once when they load the
package and then they won't need to deal with all the Unicode escape
sequences after that.

However, this is getting rejected by the CRAN checks with the message:

* checking R code for possible problems ... [4s] NOTE
pali_string_fix: no visible binding for '<<-' assignment to
  'pali_alphabet'

I'm guessing this is because the data and the function are defined in
different files, so even though those globals are defined by my package,
that isn't obvious when the check is run on this code.

Does anyone have advice for how to fix this?

     Dan

Store the cached data in an environment within the package:

pali_data <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())

pali_string_fix <- function() {
  pali_data$alphabet <-
     stringi::stri_unescape_unicode(pali_alphabet)

Thanks, Gabor. I want these to be easily available to package users though
? that's why they are in the package. So I would rather not "hide" them in
a local environment. This is fundamentally a data package, so access to
this data is the primary point of installing it.

Is there any other solution?

You shouldn't be doing that.  Write a function that returns those 
results, and tell the user that if they store them in a global variable 
named "string_fixes" (or whatever), then your function will use their 
values instead of your own built in ones.  You should never write to the 
global environment, but you can read from it.

I get that, but these variables are created by the package. It's a data
package so the whole point is to provide access to the data. I'm just
trying to provide an option to make the data more readable since I can't
include Unicode strings directly in the package. In other words, these
variables (eg, pali_alphabet) will already exist when the user attaches the
package ? but is there a way I can tweak them after the package has been
loaded?

Well, if you want to put a cache in a package, then the way I showed
you works well.

Possibly more importantly, maybe I misunderstood something, but
stringi::stri_unescape_unicode() is not doing anything or your
character vectors, because they do not contain escaped characters:

fixed <- stringi::stri_unescape_unicode(pali_alphabet)
identical(pali_alphabet, fixed)
#> TRUE

   OK, trying again.

   Would it work to save the unescaped versions in a .RData file as in 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Data-in-packages 
?  Presumably the problems with non-ASCII variables arise when they show 
up in a text-format (e.g. .R) file, not when they are read from a 
binary-format file?

   Then, if you use LazyData: yes in the DESCRIPTION file (this may be 
the default?), these should automatically be accessible to users when 
the package is loaded?

I chose a bad example. :-) Trust me that I have a bunch of strings with
escaped Unicode.

It seems the consensus is that I should not try to do what I'm trying to
do. I think instead I'll just document how users can fix the escaping if
they want to, since it's not very hard anyway.

That was where I started, but for some reason that triggered a WARNING
about these non-ASCII characters, which seemed worse. :-)

You can include Unicode strings in a package, either as data, or just
as character vectors. Or character vectors returned by functions. Many
packages do that. E.g. cli:::symbol_utf8$tick is Unicode (not
exported, but it could be).

The only restriction is that the source file must be ASCII, i.e. you
need to create these vectors with `\u` escapes. For example the tick
in cli is created like this:
https://github.com/r-lib/cli/blob/e3ca34656f5bb82df63bfc1c741e75acc79b13d9/R/symbol.R#L27

When you print it (e.g. with something like
`cat(cli:::symbol_utf8$tick)`) the proper Unicode character is
printed, as long as the platform supports it. E.g. on macOS:

? cli:::symbol_utf8$tick
[1] "?"

Message-ID: <41AB2974-96E3-4F20-989A-EFC931D6F278@krugs.de>

I know this has been asked a few times - but I can?t find anything which might help me.

I have a package (https://github.com/rkrug/ROriginStamp) which wraps around API calls to OriginStamp (https://originstamp.com) to obtain trusted time stamps.

The package works, but the tests are the problem on remote machines.

My question is:

1) I have disabled all tests and all examples if there is no environmental variable set with the API Key - is this OK for CRAN?
2) If not, how can I make this CRAN compliant?

Thanks,

Rainer

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Can these two notes be safely ignored?
Message-ID: <1599210444735.22429@inrae.fr>

Hi


I've a package that I'd like to submit to CRAN.  When I run the command  rhub::check_for_cran()  the checks on both Windows and Ubuntu virtual machines send me emails with the following two notes...


* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

Maintainer: 'David Pleydell <david.pleydell at inrae.fr>'
New submission

* checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
unable to verify current time


Could you please confirm my best-guess that I can safely ignore these notes: the first is just printing out correct information that is contained within the DESCRIPTION file. The second is related to a time check being performed on a website that is currently down - and so a check on any package would currently generate the same note.


Many thanks

David

Message-ID: <5cd99597-18bb-f8f2-9888-f58584eaedf1@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have tried to submit a textbook to the CRAN Contributed Documentation
(https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html#nenglish).

However, the instruction on how to do that are vague. The Contributed
Documentation page states "To submit, follow the submission instructions
on the CRAN main page.", however, it is impossible to upload non-R
package using the standard way (https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html).
Therefore, I decided to follow another CRAN suggestion "If this fails,
upload toftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/  and send an email to
CRAN-submissions at R-project.org  <mailto:CRAN-submissions at R-project.org>  
following the policy.", uploaded the PDF to CRAN incoming FTP and wrote
an email several days ago. I did not get any answers back.

Could you suggest me a proper way how to add a document to the CRAN
Contributed Documentation?

Best,

Jakub Nowosad

Hi Rainer,

You could set an environment variable with the API key, and only run
the tests if the variable is set.

Here's an example that I use:
https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/blob/master/tests/test_getSymbols.R#L4

Best,
Josh

Sorry, I missed that you're already doing this.  I confirm that it
works for CRAN.  I also set my API key as a private/secure variable on
TravisCI, so the tests will run there.

IIRC, testthat does something similar. You could look at that pattern,
since it works on CRAN for many packages.

Hello, all.

I have submitted a R package and it returns some NOTES from the automatic

This is because you didn't use R CMD build to build your package.

If the text "The package maintainer" is in your DESCRIPTION file, you 
should replace it with your name.

Same as 1.

You can't ignore it.  You need to make sure xi and yi are defined in the 
source of your package, and they shouldn't be the top level if you are 
modifying them. It's possible but tricky to have global in packages, and 
it would be best to just avoid the problem by not having them.

If they aren't functions that the users will see, then they don't need 
to be exported and documented.

Thanks, Stefan.

Yes, I have seen that. However I decided to ask here, as the next 
section of the Contributed Documentation website still encourages people 
to contribute. Thanks once more for clarifying it.

Message-ID: <CAOcqoUO+FuFY2eWjYjwi0bnFXZk5PH7r6RzuJdRmyh0-Aq2f3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to publish on CRAN a package that uses the INLA::inla function
from the INLA package. The INLA package is outside CRAN. After package
submission, CRAN gives me an error that seems to be related to the use of
this INLA::inla function on Debian R. The error says that the INLA package
is not available. Below the result of the CRAN check.

Can I do anything about it? Can I still publish my package on CRAN?
Thanks
Edoardo

   It's surprising that this is only an error on Debian ...
   In general "strong dependencies not in mainstream repositories" is a 
non-starter. Here is the relevant paragraph from the CRAN repository 
policies:

 > Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a 
mainstream repository ...  [where "depends" means 
"Depends/Imports/LinkingTo]

    In principle you could create a package that only "Suggests:" INLA 
(and uses it conditionally) but is effectively non-functional without it 
(i.e. in the absence of INLA, all examples or tests that depend on INLA 
are disabled).  This does seem to defeat the intention of the policy, 
though.  I don't know if the CRAN maintainers would reject it for 
violating the spirit of the policy ...

    cheers

Hi Josh,

Thanks for the thumbs-up for CRAN.

With the secure variable on Travis - that is exactly what I am doing.

Thanks a lot,

Rainer

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Compiling 32-bit on Windows using 64-bit gcc and -m32
Message-ID: <003b01d68539$70553230$50ff9690$@denney.ws>

Hello,

 

My question is:

Can I use the 64-bit gcc to build a 32-bit package with the -m32 command
line option with Rtools?  And, can that work for CRAN?  Or more generally,
is there a work-around for needing lots of RAM during compilation with the
32-bit compiler?

 

The background is:

I'm trying to compile a the development version of RxODE
(https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/RxODE/issues/278), but I'm hitting
32-bit memory limits (using >3GB and possibly >4GB RAM during compilation)
using the 32-bit version of gcc.  Specifically, 

 

"C:/rtools40/mingw32/bin/"gcc [etc., see the link above for the full command
line]

 

yields the error

 

cc1.exe: out of memory allocating 65536 bytes

 

There is no problem building with mingw64, and I played around to confirm
that by using:

 

Sys.setenv(BINPREF="c:/rtools40/mingw64/bin/")

 

And compilation completed successfully (though installation failed as
expected because the compiled .dll couldn't load on 32-bit R).

 

Thanks,

 

Bill

Did you have any update on this? If there is a problem with MinGW-w64 
version, you can (just for experimentation) try UCRT demo build, which 
uses a newer version of MinGW-w64 than RTools 4:

Please note Brian Ripley has added/improved support for cross-compiling 
on Linux for Windows, so that it can be used for diagnosing LTO warnings 
(see NEWS in R-devel and src/gnuwin32/README.compilation). The 
cross-compilers and needed cross-compiled libraries for R itself are 
part of at least some Linux distributions (he tested on Fedora).

Microsoft is giving for free time-limited VMs primarily for testing 
Edge/MSIE, you can run them in e.g. in Virtualbox. As instructed in the 
VM, take snapshots often.

Being able to test R on Wine may be useful, if you figure it out, I 
would be interested to learn more. It is easier to obtain, may be easier 
to automate, and some low-level bugs may be easier to diagnose. Of 
course, for the price of sometimes seeing errors not present on real 
Windows.

I think this is too much memory to be used for compilation. I think it 
would be best to simplify the code, possibly split it, or just reduce 
the optimization level, as I read you have done already anyway. Maybe it 
doesn't have to be -O0, maybe you can enable some. In the past I've seen 
similar cases when inlining too aggressively in large files, maybe you 
could just reduce that a bit. It may very well be that reducing the 
optimization level just a little bit will provide about the same 
performance, but require far less memory at compile time (in the past 
there have been cases when -O3 did not produce faster code than -O2 on a 
set of standard benchmarks, of course that may be different in today's 
compilers).

Spending much more time for optimizing of the 32-bit builds may not be 
worth the effort (and neither on the R/CRAN side).

As we are in conditional mode: maybe that could be recognized by adding an
explicit flag allowing us to disable 32-bit builds on a case by case basis?

And it would be nice to be able to do this for that other OS none of us have
access too (outside of a win-builder instance that differs subtly in setup
from the CRAN one).

Yes, we are testing reducing the optimization level.  Using -O0 works to compile using ~500 MB.  The code can't be simplified as it is a very long algebraic equation.  The function is often used in the middle of an optimization routine that can often takes minutes to hours (statistical minimization here, not meaning compiler optimization), so optimization is preferable.  But, it's a fair point that I don't know the value of the different -O optimization levels for what is only long algebra.

Thanks,

Bill

Message-ID: <f87af79b-5fcb-0326-599b-a04a56cde8e1@stanford.edu>

We've been struggling to get past CRAN's rejections for a new upload of 
CVXR.? The new version makes essentially one change to the existing 
version on CRAN: the addition of a DOI to an article to appear in JSS.? 
We realize that CRAN may tighten policies in the meantime forcing some 
changes to be made, which we are happy to do. But we are not sure what.

The automated check 
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/CVXR_1.0-6_20200908_223033/> 
came back with 2 notes on Debian and Windows, both addressed in replies 
and submission comments. (Solaris failures are expected, also noted.)

The communications with CRAN indicates that the problem might be that 
our package (the current version too) _suggests_ solvers not available 
on CRAN. These are either on github or on vendor websites (free to 
academics after login).? One reply from CRAN suggested that we either 
use the "Additional_repositories" field or provide some text in 
Description. The former is not applicable---these are not CRAN-like 
repositories---so we added text in the description with URL links.

What could we be missing?

Thanks.

Hi Naras
I had a similar issue recently with
https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/ --- it Suggests: re2r which is
a package that is no longer on CRAN, but available on github. To solve the
issue I just copied the re2r into a drat repo, which is a CRAN-like
repository hosted on github. More info on drat here
http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratForPackageAuthors.html So if those
solver packages you have in Suggests are open-source, you can just copy
them to your drat repo, and list that drat repo in Additional_repositories.
If they aren't open-source then you should provide a description of how to
obtain those packages in Description. Something like "gurobi package is not
available in any public open-source repositories but can be downloaded for
academic use free of charge from $GUROBI_URL"
BTW thanks for your efforts in getting CVXR on CRAN, that is really
important work!
Toby

Message-ID: <CADVZz_oa0SsbYPCT2SsWymnDsi1VXtyQ7ViM+aKzGGuZhiwnwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have been facing travis build fail on linux xenial due to *fftwtools
fatal error* (fftw3.h: No such file or directory) with my R package. The
error appeared at a random time a few months ago (at a random time := I do
not link it with any fftwtools-function related change commit I did) and
persists.

There is not much I achieved in googling and trying to decipher it, sadly;
I am hoping maybe some Community members saw a similar error with their dev
work and can suggest a hint/solution?

Hi Marta,

One change I can see from your Git history that seems to match the first failed build on Travis is when you added "Imports: fftwtools" to your DESCRIPTION file. And it makes sense, because if we look at its DESCRIPTION file, we can see that it has fftw3 as a SystemRequirements. In other words, it needs to be installed on Travis before you can run the checks on your package.

As for solutions, I can see that Karim wrote a short description of how to install the library on Linux, and there's a link for Mac; all this is on the Github repo: https://github.com/krahim/fftwtools

I also noticed that there is an R package wrapping fftw on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=fftw) and I can see that it's a Suggested package for fftwtools. I haven't tried it, but presumably you could install the fftw R package, instead of the fftw3 library.

HTH,

 sudo apt-get install -y fftw3

Then try again.

Let me know if it doesn't work.

Cheers!

Or maybe rather

   sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev

Thanks,

That may be it. It is a missing dependency.

It's been a while and I'm not sure which package exposes fftw3.h ...

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] DOI for archived package?
Message-ID: <58f64994-30da-d9a5-724d-5f2ba3e11e79@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am in the process of submitting a "workflow" article about an R 
package (which is onCRAN) to F1000Research. The associate editor that I 
am dealing with wants a "DOI" for the source code of the package being 
described in the manuscript.? I have already explained that CRAN 
archives all versions of packages, and I sent him the URL to the archive 
page for the package, However, he still seems to believe that a DOI 
needs to be assigned by some site like Zenodo.

I haven't yet responded by pointing out that CRAN has been archiving all 
versions of packages since at least the year 2000, it has mirrors all 
over the world, and the URL/URI used here is likely to be far more 
permanent than the DOI from Zenodo. Nor have I pointed out that there 
are more than 15,000 packages at CRAN, nor that not a single R user 
would ever think to go look on Zenodo for an R package.

Does anyone have other suggestions for how to respond? (I know;? I could 
just put the [expletive] thing into Zenodo and move on, but creating a 
permanent identifier for something that will *never *be accessed just 
seems stupid.)

Thanks,
 ? Kevin

Dear Kevin,

My git2rdata package is on CRAN, ROpenSci and Zenodo. The GitHub repo is
linked to Zenodo, so every release on GitHub gets its own DOI.

The benefit of the DOI is that it makes it easier for others to cite your
package in a consistent manner. And you'll get a better overview of those
citations.

So I won't waste time arguing over this and use that time to put it on
Zenodo.

Best regards,

PS Zenodo is well funded (https://about.zenodo.org/infrastructure/) and
IMHO equally likely to be permanent as CRAN is.

If you proposed
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/<pkg>/<pkg>_<version>.tar.gz
and the editor is suspicious about the "src/contrib/Archive" stuff, you
could propose instead
https://cran.r-project.org/package=<pkg>&version=<version>,
which *looks* more permanent I guess.

As a tangential but informational comment, Bioconductor started minting
minimalist DOIs for packages a couple years ago. I do not think DOIs have
seen broad uptake as a citation mechanism for Bioc packages (I states
without evidence), but the opportunity arose to do so and we took it.

Adding the following to .travis.yml:

before_install:
  - if [ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" = "linux" ]; then sudo apt-get -y install
libfftw3-dev ; fi

did the trick!

Thank you both for your attention to this issue!

Bests,

If your article is published with a DOI and read by anyone actually interested in it then it will be likely be accessed, so "never" seems rather pessimistic of you. You could simply not argue with your editor and acquiesce.

I think that is an example of the issue discussed in this blog post:
  http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2020/08/26#029_introducing_bspm

The RSPM system gets you the package, but it is by its (on purpose simple)
design disconnected and unaware of the dependency required which sent you
down a rabbit hole. (One could also suggest that maybe Karim should expand
   SystemRequirements:	fftw3 (>= 3.1.2)
to maybe list the packages offering fftw3 _headers_. Jeroen uses a pattern
for this, eg curl has
   SystemRequirements:	libcurl: libcurl-devel (rpm) or libcurl4-openssl-dev (deb).
which is already one step better.)

Only systems with actual dependency resolution can go further, but it is hard
to do that cross-platform / cross-OS.  On Linux we have both BSPM utilising
the existing rpm and deb binaries, respectively, maintained by tireless
volunteers, as well as the older use of directly using the binaries.

Eg looking at the Ubuntu binary from the Rutter PPA shows that
r-cran-fftwtools will bring the fftw3 runtime in:

   docker at 08d894be427a:/work$ apt-cache show r-cran-fftwtools | grep ^Depends
   Depends: r-base-core, libfftw3-double3 (>= 3.3.5)
   docker at 08d894be427a:/work$ 

That would be an easier binary install as it skips the 'from source' build
step that sent Marta hunting for the required header.

If I find some time I will try to set up some Travis CI examples utilizing
BSPM.  Until then, one can do as I have done for over half a decade and point
Travis CI to these binaries via the (still maintained and simple) r-travis
setup.  Works for me.  See http://eddelbuettel.github.io/r-travis/  and
numerous .travis.yml in packages of mine and a few other users.

Hi Dirk,

Thanks for resolving this! It's been awhile since I've worked on this...

So for dependencies, I'd like to keep it as simple as possible. I agree
fftw3 may need to be updated.

It's my understanding that if one were to install the latest fftw (3.3.8)
from source then it would expose the header file.

Is this incorrect?

If this is the case, then it becomes about the various distribution
specific packages.
So then I want to aim people in the right direction.

How about?

fftw3 (>= 3.1.2; ensure fftw3.h is exposed - libfftw3-dev in Ubuntu)

Kind Regards,
Karim

Not necessarily and it depends on how the package is setup.

In general you want a '-dev' or '-devel' package but I do not know what this
one is called in the Fedora/RH/CentOS world.

| fftw3 (>= 3.1.2; ensure fftw3.h is exposed - libfftw3-dev in Ubuntu)

So per the above I would suggest you reconsider the curl example I emailed
earlier and do something like

  fftw3 development package: libfftw3-dev (deb), ..... (rpm)

Maybe someone can help with the rpm package name.

Cheers, Dirk

I can compile a package under clang++ with -stdlib=libstdc++, but with -stdlib=libc++ I get

"

???????? ^~~~~~~

Is there any howto for using Rcpp with -stdlib=libc++ ?

Hello,

There is only one fftw3 tar.gz  file that I see.

http://www.fftw.org/download.html

Once built it provides headers and static libraries to use fftw3 in cpp.

For an example of how it's used in cpp see:
http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Complex-One_002dDimensional-DFTs.html#Complex-One_002dDimensional-DFTs

As a general rule, you will need header files and to compile cpp code
using libraries.

This package basically provides a wrapper for fftw3 cpp routines. I
wrote it so I could easily swap fftw for fft in my multitaper package.

Ok I looked at the curl dependencies on the cran page.

If I do something similar, I would have:
libfftw3-dev (deb)
fftw-devel (rpm)

The documentation for these two packages state these contain the
header files and static libraries.

https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libfftw3-dev
http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=fftw-devel

I don't expect to rush this update, and I would appreciate
confirmation before doing this from a redhat user.

I appreciate that this is of use. I get less comments about this than
multitaper.

Kind regards,
Karim

That has zero to do with Rcpp.  You are lacking a C++ library header when
switching the C++ standard library along with clang. Nothing that Rcpp ships,
or governs, or selects.  

I am forgetting the fine details here (and someone may hopefully fill in
fuller details) but in short, "that is just the way it is".  I think we
simply pivot back to the g++ standard C++ library even when using clang++.

Cheers from Chicago,  Dirk

hello,

?
i am submitting my first package for CRAN, but am failing pre-check on windows and debian. below is an excerpt from the failure message:

?

package wordpressr_0.1.0.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically, please see the following pre-tests:
Windows: <https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/wordpressr_0.1.0_20200912_211523/Windows/00check.log>

?
as the logs confirm, the only note is related to this being a new submission. should i email CRAN staff noting that this is a false-positive that should be reviewed??

?
any and all help is most appreciated!

?
thanks

Hi Simit,

There's actually more happening in the NOTE than simply a reminder that this is a new submission. You get a message about a possibly invalid URL because of a redirect, and you also get this:

Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

You may get this message when the "vignettes.rds" file is omitted because of a line in .Rbuildignore; see for example this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39649133/package-has-a-vignettebuilder-field-but-no-prebuilt-vignette-index

I am submitting a package to CRAN and I have got the below warning from the reviewers team: Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index. that I have in fact seen also when

My understanding is that many Linux OSes package the clang compiler, the
libc++ standard library, and the headers used by the libc++ standard
library separately. To install those headers, you likely need (e.g. on
Ubuntu):

    sudo apt install libc++-dev libc++abi-dev

to be able to build and compile programs against libc++.

This also comes with the caveat that mixing programs built against
different standard library implementations is in general a bad idea, so you
may see issues if you mix libraries compiled with libstdc++ and libc++ in
the same R session. (This can come up with R packages that link to other
libraries installed on the system, which will typically be built with and
linked against the "default" system compiler + standard library
implementations.) I'm not sure if this will be an issue in practice with
what you're doing, but it's worth being aware of.

Best,
Kevin

Thank you Dirk and Kevin,

that was very helpful and

did the job!

Great, this was very important to me.
Thanks again

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN incoming checks email
Message-ID: <CAGmyFCGsE7zxs-kNt9MrkWoRONu9sL4f6=zGWK_f=-80WLUhxA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List-Members:

The email from the automatic incoming checks says to "reply-all" in case
one suspects a false-positive, yet the reply-to header is set only to "
CRAN-submissions at r-project.org". My email program (just as myself)
interprets this as "reply-all means replying only to
CRAN-submissions at r-project.org". The wording in the email, on the other
hand, suggests I also should reply to Uwe Ligges. I find the current
disagreement of wording and email headers more than confusing.

Can someone clarify the correct protocol of replying to the email? I
wouldn't want to unnecessarily bother Uwe Ligges with even more emails.

Thanks,
David

Message-ID: <CAGmyFCFVBXmyUR+YbOKB0Sc=KK67kYjQH18mewXDCTgGiNgQOg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I submitted an update for my package and got automatically rejected by the
incoming checks (as expected from my own checks) for using `:::` calls to
access the package's namespace.
"There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package
*almost* never needs to use ::: for its own objects:?" (emphasis mine)

This was a conscious decision on my part as the package runs code on a
user-supplied parallel cluster and I consider cluster-exporting the
required functions a no-go as it would potentially overwrite objects in the
clusters R sessions. The package code does not own the cluster and hence
the R sessions. Therefore overwriting objects could potentially lead to
unintended behaviour which is opaque to the user and difficult to debug.

Another solution to circumvent the R CMD check note is to export the
functions to the public namespace but mark them as internal. This was also
suggested in another thread on this mailing list (c.f. "Etiquette for
package submissions that do not automatically pass checks?"). I do not
agree with this work-around as the methods are indeed internal and should
never be used by users. Exporting truly internal functions for the sake of
satisfying R CMD check is a bad argument, in particular if there is a
clean, well-documented, solution by using `:::`.

I argue `:::` is the only clean solution to this problem and no dirty
work-arounds are necessary. This is a prime example of where `:::` is
actually useful and needed inside a package. If the R community disagrees,
I think R CMD check should at least emit a WARNING instead of a NOTE and
elaborate on the problem and accepted work-arounds in "Writing R
extensions". Or keep emitting a NOTE but listing those nebulous reasons
where `:::` would be tolerated inside a package. Having more transparent
criteria for submitting to CRAN would be really helpful to the entire R
community and probably also reduce the traffic on this mailing list.

Best,
David

Who is calling this function:  package code or user code?  I assume it's 
a bit of a mix:  your package writes a script that calls the function 
when it runs in user space.  (It would help if you gave an explicit 
example of when you need to use this technique.)

If my assumption is correct, there are other simple workarounds besides 
exporting the functions.  Instead of putting

    pkg:::foo(args)

into your script, put

    pkg::callInternal("foo", args)

where pkg::callInternal is an exported function that can look up 
unexported functions in the namespace.

You may argue that you prefer pkg:::foo for some reason:  to which I'd 
respond that you are being rude to the CRAN volunteers.  I've offered 
two options (one in the previous thread, a different one here), and 
there was a third one in that thread offered by Ivan Krylov.  Surely one 
of these is good enough for your needs, and you shouldn't force CRAN to 
handle you specially.

At least in the 'parallel' package

library(parallel)
cl = makePSOCKcluster(2)

and because of the nature of the R language, the entire namespace is exported, analogous to

baz <- local({
    foo <- function() 2
    function(...) foo()
})

so making a package function baz available makes all functions in the package available -- a function in the package already has access to other functions in the namespace, whether those functions are exported or not, so there is no need to use :::.

> parSapply(1:2, baz)
[1] 2 2

This is in contrast to what one might expect from exploring things on the command line, where foo is defined in the global environment and, by convention, the global environment is not serialized to the workers

> foo <- function() 1
> bar <- function(...) foo()
> parLapply(cl, 1:2, bar)
Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) : 
  2 nodes produced errors; first error: could not find function "foo"

Do you really need to use `:::`?

Another possibility is what quantmod::newTA() does.
https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/blob/a8e9cb87825c0997a8468f5105db6c507b26ac5d/R/newTA.

It's a function that creates a user-facing function.  The created
function needs to access unexported objects from the quantmod
namespace.  newTA() accomplishes that by setting the environment of
the function it returns to the quantmod namespace.

https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/blob/a8e9cb87825c0997a8468f5105db6c507b26ac5d/R/newTA.R#L98

That gives the user's new function access to the unexported charting
objects it needs to work.

Hope that helps.

Best,
Josh

Thanks, Martin. I completely missed that the parallel package serializes
the entire environment of the function, including the package namespace and
so `:::` is indeed unnecessary in my use case. I probably experimented in
the global environment first and extrapolated the observed behaviour to the
package. Sorry for annoying everyone with this.

I also have another use of `:::` for which I am not sure if it's considered
disallowed use of `:::`, so I'm throwing it out there for feedback.
I have one internal function which checks a long list of common arguments
to several other functions, similar to
internal_check_args <- function (sd = 2, type = c("bootstrap",
"theoretical"), ...) {
  # check arguments for valid ranges, etc.
  return(list(sd = sd, type = match.arg(type))
}

And several functions which use the internal function for argument checking
and such, similar to
exported_foo <- function (x, sd = 2, type = c("bootstrap", "theoretical")) {
  args_call <- match.call()
  args_call[[1]] <- quote(mypackage:::internal_check_args)
  args <- eval.parent(args_call)
}

exported_foo_cv <- function (x, cv_folds = 3, ...) {
  args_call <- match.call(expand.dots = TRUE)
  args_call[[1]] <- quote(mypackage:::internal_check_args)
  args <- eval.parent(args_call)
}

This is modelled after what, e.g., `lm()` does with `model.frame()`, only
that `internal_check_args()` is not exported, hence I use `:::`. There are
other solutions for this type of use of `:::` (probably some considered
cleaner) but again without guidelines on when `:::` is acceptable it's
difficult for package maintainers to know when to use/not use it. From all
the discussions it seems that there is absolutely no acceptable use of
`:::` and work-arounds are always the better alternative.

In light of the other interesting points brought up by discussants, I also
want to honor their time and reply here.

You may argue that you prefer pkg:::foo for some reason:  to which I'd

I am sorry it came across rude when I tried to solicit arguments for why
the use of `:::` is considered "bad practice", while work-arounds are
considered to be okay. I wouldn't force CRAN to handle my case specially; I
rather wanted to challenge the general "attitude" towards the use of `:::`.
I am sure there is a need to discourage the use of `:::` in packages as
CRAN volunteers probably have seen hundreds of cases where `:::` was abused
(such as mine, as Martin Morgan pointed out).

you can use

That would be a work-around I would have used if necessary. But my general
question remains: why should I reinvent the wheel when R already comes with
`:::`? The only advantage of all the work-arounds I've seen would be to
trick R CMD check that the code is okay, when in fact the same "bad
practice" is practiced.

Best,
David

Apologize if I hijack this thread, but the use of ::: is something I was puzzled.

I tried Duncan's solution in my R package mypkg, something like:

pkg::callInternal("foo", args)

R CMD check mypkg

* checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING
'::' or ':::' import not declared from: ?pkg'

I probably missed something here.

Thanks,
Zhu

Who is calling this function:  package code or user code?  I assume it's a bit of a mix:  your package writes a script that calls the function when it runs in user space.  (It would help if you gave an explicit example of when you need to use this technique.)

If my assumption is correct, there are other simple workarounds besides exporting the functions.  Instead of putting

    pkg:::foo(args)

into your script, put

    pkg::callInternal("foo", args)

where pkg::callInternal is an exported function that can look up unexported functions in the namespace.

You may argue that you prefer pkg:::foo for some reason:  to which I'd respond that you are being rude to the CRAN volunteers.  I've offered two options (one in the previous thread, a different one here), and there was a third one in that thread offered by Ivan Krylov.  Surely one of these is good enough for your needs, and you shouldn't force CRAN to handle you specially.
