Hello, All:


 ????? I've been unable to get SSH to work with 
"https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda", documented in my email to this 
group almost 3 weeks ago.? I've been able to do "git clone 
https://sbgraves237:<GitHub-password>@github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda", then 
change a file, do "git commit" and "git push".


 ????? However, this has my GitHub password in a plain text ".git" file 
on my hard drive.? I think the hard drive on my computer is encrypted, 
so maybe that's not a problem.


 ????? Am I not allowed to use SSH with a GitHub repository that's not 
my own?


 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves


p.s.? Since my previous email, Ramsay added "README.md" to that 
repository.? I can do "git clone" and get it, then edit it, then "git 
commit".? However, "git push" keeps giving me errors:


git push
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 
'https://<token>@github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda/'


 ????? A few hours ago, the owner, JamesRamsay5, went to "Settings" > 
"Manage access", then invited me as a collaborator.? I got an email 
asking me to "view invitation", which I did.? I got another email 
saying, "Hey there, we?re just writing to let you know that you?ve been 
automatically subscribed to a repository on GitHub." Sadly, I still 
couldn't access it, so I I deleted my token and created a new one.? I 
also deleted my previous local clone of "fda" and recreated it using? 
"git clone https://<token>@github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda".? Then I did a 
test edit to the one file in that repository, README.md.? I think did 
'git commit README.md -m "tst edit"'.? Then "git push" keeps giving me 
the error just mentioned.

Hi Spencer,


Did you follow the instructions here? https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


Once the key is setup, you should be able to do "git clone git at github.com:JamesRamsay5/fda.git", without any need to input a token or a password in the command. Similarly, git push/pull/fetch should all work seamlessly.


This is how I've used Github for many years, and it's always worked fine.


Best,

Max

Hi, Max et al.:


 ??? ? With SSH established:


git clone git at github.com:JamesRamsay5/fda.git


 ??? ? Worked.


 ????? I had tried something like "git clone 
git at github.com:JamesRamsay5/fda.git" before, but I either did not have 
that exact syntax or I tried that before I had SSH.


 ????? Thanks again,
 ????? Spencer Graves

Message-ID: <20200406142129.EGroupware.03ZLD_VgacS_cdTQ6r6zcEC@_>

Dear all,

I just submitted the new package "JuliaConnectoR" to CRAN.
(See https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR )
The submission does not pass the automatic checks because of two notes (see below).
One note is simply that I am a new submitter.
The other note is because of the the use of "attach".
But I am certain that I am using "attach" in the right way. In its documentation, under "Good practice" , it says,
"In programming, functions should not change the search path unless that is their purpose."
Here this is exactly the purpose because one of the main functionalities of the package is to add Julia functions to the search path.
Can anybody help me with this?
Best wishes
Stefan

True, but this misses the "Letter of the law" versus the "Spirit of the law".

It might be worth mentioning that use of attach() is seen, to find one poor
analogy, pretty much like use of global variables these days. "Just because
you could does not mean you should".

See e.g. one of the first google hits for 'r do not use attach' here:

  Fair enough.  I'm going to derail/repurpose this thread to ask a
couple of questions about attach().

   I have often used with() for situations where I want to evaluate a
bunch of expressions with the elements of a parameter vector, e.g.
inside a gradient function for deSolve::ode().  However, I have found
this very hard to debug because (AFAIK) you can't debug-step through the
components of a with() expression.
  Potential solutions for this include

 1. attach(params); on.exit(detach(params))

  * this will be flagged by CRAN
  * I have found some really surprising (to me) precedence issues with
this _when used in a package context_ - it looks like the elements in
'params' are found _after_ built-in objects in R?? (I have to take some
time to make a MRE of this

  2. The zeallot package does 'unpacking' as with Python tuples.  I was
worried about dragging in tidyverse dependencies, but it looks like it
doesn't actually Import: anything.
   This doesn't quite do what I want, as I want to unpack using the
names in the object (which makes it look perfect for the attach() solution)


  Thoughts?

I don't have a strong opinion on this:  the proposed use seems to be no 
worse than library() or require().  Those are fine for users to use, but 
are discouraged in a package.  If the attach() never happens without an 
explicit request from the user (and that's what it sounds like), I'd say 
it's probably okay.

However, there is an easy workaround:  just return the environment 
without attaching it.  Then the user has the choice of attaching it, or 
using it as a prefix when they call the functions in it.  So it's not as 
though this will destroy the utility of the package if Stefan isn't 
allowed to call attach().

My case is a little bit different from the use of global variables for data described in the Stackoverflow post.
I import a data base which contains function names of Julia functions from a Julia package.
This is analogous to loading a package in R.
The goal is to make it possible to call Julia functions like R functions.
If you call library(...) in R then the functions contained in the package are also available in the global search path.
In this case it doesn't make sense to use "with".
I am open to suggestions how I can change it to make it better, but the goal is really to be able to write

    juliaUsing("SomeJuliaPackage") # exports myJuliaFunction
    myJuliaFunction()

same as you would write

    library("MyRPackage") # exports myRFunction
    myRFunction()

Best wishes

Stefan

Hi,
following up on this.
Has anybody encountered this issue or could give some insights on it?
Is there anything I can do here, except avoiding using Matrix in the union class?

Thanks

Yes, as I wrote earlier, I would like to imitate the behaviour of loading an R package

 juliaUsing("SomeJuliaPackage") # exports myJuliaFunction
 myJuliaFunction()

like R:

 library("MyRPackage") # exports myRFunction
 myRFunction()

I could return an environment, such that the call becomes

 attach(juliaUsing("SomeJuliaPackage"))
 myJuliaFunction()

But calling juliaUsing(), as it is now, takes care that if a package is imported a second time,
the first data base is removed via detach().
This way, users do not have to worry about calling juliaUsing() mutliple times in a script, same
as R users don't have to worry about calling library() multiple times.
If you call the code with attach() multiple times and do not detach, you get your screen cluttered with
warnings "xxx is masked by xxx".
So I would say it would decrease user-friendliness to return an environment.
I also want to make explicit, that the call to attach
occurs only once in my code, after creating the environment:

 envName <- paste0("JuliaConnectoR:", absoluteModulePath)
 if (envName %in% search()) {
 detach(envName, character.only = TRUE)
 }
 attach(funenv, name = envName)

This code is only called by juliaImport() and juliaUsing(), which aren't called by any other function of 
the package
and are supposed to be called directly by the user.

I suspect what happened is that you had a copy of a built-in function in 
the global environment.  The global environment always comes ahead of 
attach()'d environments.  On the other hand, with() gets it right.

You can see this:

x <- 123
df <- data.frame(x = 456)
with(df, x)
#> [1] 456
attach(df)
#> The following object is masked _by_ .GlobalEnv:
#>
#>     x
x
#> [1] 123
detach(df)

As for debugging, the setBreakpoint() function can set a breakpoint in 
the code block in with().  RStudio uses that or some equivalent for 
setting breakpoints, so it can set breakpoints within the block.

If you call debug() on a function and get to a with() statement, you can 
eventually get to the code within it by hitting "s" (step in) several 
times.  It's fairly scary stepping into .Internal(), but it does

I wouldn't use it that way.  I'd write it as

     sjp <- juliaUsing("SomeJuliaPackage")
     sjp$myJuliaFunction()

This is similar to the advice to use pkg::foo() rather than library(pkg) 
followed by plain foo() in the code.

One could take the position that the library and require functions were a mistake to begin with and that all contributed packages should be accessed using ::...  or one could recognize that these functions are an expected feature of R at this point and then it is not defensible to ban the proposed approach of importing names as Stefan wants to. I don't think it is fair to require this higher level of specificity just because it involves use of attach.

That said, another feature of R packages is the integrated help system... importing Julia functions wholesale may lead to problems with consistency in navigating the help files. IMO it may be justifiable to ban this particular syntactic convenience to maintain some separation in the minds of users looking for help on these new functions, since the syntactic and semantic structure of functions from another language may not align well with normal R functions. But I am not familiar with Julia or Stefan's package or the support it brings in this area... I just disagree with banning a "library" lookalike function "just because" it happens to involve attach.

Message-ID: <7cf879d3.2ce8.171535093ff.Coremail.jared_wood@163.com>

Dear all?

I have three datasets (drugbank.rda edgar.rda mala.rda) in my package and I put them in the document folder which called ?data?.

 

And I just use the dataset in the function. However, here comes a note:

 

drugbank_disease_gene: no visible binding for global variable

    'drugbank'

  edgar_disease_gene: no visible binding for global variable 'edgar'

  malacards_disease_gene: no visible binding for global variable 'mala'

  Undefined global functions or variables:

drugbank edgar mala

 

It shows that I need to do something else. I am confused and I don? know what need to do next.

 

Thanks for your attention.

Either use the data() function to retrieve it or use the

LazyData: true

line in your DESCRIPTION file.

Thank you very much for your comment. 
Could you elaborate how you think that it could interfere with the help system?
I haven't yet connected the Julia help with the R help, as the R help system is quite complex and RStudio handles it again differently. So it's simply like the functions were declared on the command line. They have no help.
A simply way to print the help for a Julia function, e.g. the function "first", is to call
 juliaEval("@doc first")
This then simply prints the output on the command line.

I did not say "interfere"... I said "problems with consistency". I don't think your wholesale import of functions without corresponding help pages is consistent with the normal use of R, which will make reading R code written with this mechanism in place a painful source of trouble for help forums.

On the other hand, if the code is prefaced with an environment name then there will be no expectation that a help page should exist on the part of someone reading that code for the first time. (It will be no less obscure, but at least it won't be misleading.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Windows specific install error
Message-ID: <CAD9kV-LGosh0NoV90pYv3UuRSAaVwMpmxJLqvV4wyMSXaF538w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

My package seems to pass all the CRAN checks for Linux but fails to install
on Windows. This is the contents of 00install.out:

* installing *source* package 'DiPALM' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** data
** inst
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
Error: .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'S4Vectors', details:
  call: validObject(.Object)
  error: invalid class "LLint" object: superclass "integer_OR_LLint"
not defined in the environment of the object's class
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'DiPALM'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/DiPALM'


If I understand the error, it's saying that the CRAN server cannot
load the S4Vectors package because one of classes it depends on is not
defined. I'm guessing this is a namespace issue? I've taken a few
shots at adding directives to my NAMESPACE file but obviously I don't
know what I'm doing or maybe the error has nothing to do with my
package namespace.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

This is the same as

  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2020q1/005256.html

and due I believe to stale packages on the CRAN windows builder; the solution is I believe on the CRAN side.

Dear all,

I was notified about errors:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_replicateBE.html

Since I don't have access to those operating systems, I'm a little bit lost.
Here is what I get with 64bit R on Windows:
library(replicateBE)
x <- method.B(details = TRUE, print = FALSE,
               data = rds30, option = 1)[c(10, 19)]
y <- c(17.86418, 92.73371)
d <- as.numeric(signif(abs(x - y), 7))

With R 3.6.2
print(d)
[1] 4.431372e-06 1.182994e-07

With R 3.6.3
print(d)
[1] 1.078696e-05 1.182989e-07

x[10] are Satterthwaite's degrees of freedom obtained by package 
pbkrtest. In both R-versions I use its current version (0.4-8.6 of 
2020-02-20).

Any ideas / suggestions?
As a workaround I could reduce the tolerance of testthat's 
expect_quivalent() from to currently 5e-7 to a higher (_which one?_) 
value. But I still want to know what might be going on the CRAN's 
linux/solaris devel/patched installations since the other R-versions on 
all operating systems passed the tests.

Cheers,
Helmut

Do both of your R installations use the same version of lme4 ?

A new lme4 version has been published on CRAN yesterday and some changes
regarding default numerical tolerances in optimizations could explain
the difference in your results. See the NEWS here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/news.html

THX, good point! On R3.6.2 I have lme4 1.1-21 (2019-03-05) and on R3.6.3 
indeed yesterday's lme4 1.1-23.

I see. Since the other 93 (!) tests passed, I will submit a fix only for 
_this_ data set. A little bit nasty since we recently published a paper 
about software validation: https://dx.doi.org/10.1208/s12248-020-0427-6
The supplementary material contains code for IQ (installation 
qualification). If a user on r-devel (Linux) or r-patched (Solaris) runs 
it ? with the current lme4 - he/she will be slapped in the face and the 
suppl. material will tell him/her:
"If a test fails [?] the package did not pass IQ in the user?s 
computational environment (hardware, operating system, R-release) and 
_must not_ be used."
Splendid.

Cheers,
Helmut

Hi Renaud,
One reason you got no response here, is because we don't even
know about which package you are talking.

So there's nothing, anybody can reproduce from your posting.

There have been changes in R's dealing with class unions etc,
notably even *relating* to an earlier bug report on class unions
exactly for such a case which was *triggered* when people built
on such Matrix classes.

But we would really want to be able to reproduce what you are seeing..

Best regards,
Martin Maechler

Use trace() to get a bit more detail - .__C_compMatrix is looked for in the
wrong environment with inherits=FALSE.

Thank you William for the reproducible example.

Currently I using the following (same as in William's example):
setClassUnion("mMatrix", c("Matrix", "matrix"))

Martin, are the changes made in the union class handling affecting the way we should declare them?
Thank you.

Bests,
Renaud

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Add SystemRequirements of imported package in
 description file?
Message-ID: <936BA237-CCC6-4006-B5FC-FEF0AEA60FD4@contoso.com>

Hi all,

should ?SystemRequirements? of an imported package be listed in the description file of a package?

General scenario:
- Package X imports Package Y.
- Package Y lists ?libzzz? as SystemRequirements.

Should Package X list the SystemRequirements ?libzzz? as well? (question occurred @ https://github.com/dleutnant/influxdbr/issues/47)

Thank you and happy easter!
Dominik

Dear Dominik,

IMHO you only need to list "first order" dependencies: things that your
package directly uses. Listing higher order dependencies would be redundant
as they are listed in the packages that have them as first order dependency.

It is important for me to get my package into CRAN.
I haven't gotten any answer from the CRAN maintainers. I already tried to submit a version of the package before some months and haven't gotten any reply then.
The replies you gave me (thanks to all engaged in the discussion) were mixed.
I still think that the library-like import is a good feature, but if it is not possible to get this package on CRAN with it, I will change it with returning an environment like reticulate.
My question now is:
So what would be the process how to proceed?
Is there anybody who can make a decision in such cases?
Or do I make this decision myself after I lost hope that it will be accepted the way it is now?

Stefan

Hi Stefan,

first of all, thank you for taking the time and effort to link Julia and R. That said, I would strongly encourage you to go for a reticulate-like approach. There's a good reason for that. Once you start mixing languages, you really want to have some indication what code is ran in what language. Especially since I can imagine at one point there'll be a Julia function masking an R function of the same name, and that is going to cause a world of hurt and confusion. 

If you don't like environments, you can try to use namespace functionality. There's the "namespace" package that allows you to create one, and some internal namespace functions are visible (eg namespaceExport() from base). That's going to be the closest to mimicking R packages, but it's beyond my knowledge to know how feasible this approach actually is. I hope someone else chimes in, especially if this is dangerous for other reasons I overlooked.

Kind regards
Joris

Hi!
Thanks for pointing to the package "namespace". 
I experimented with it but I couldn't really figure out how it is supposed to work:

The following code leads to strange errors that I don't understand:

 > nse <- list2env(list(data="x", asdf = 2))
 > namespace::registerNamespace(name = "NewNamespace", env = nse)
 > NewNamespace::asdf
 Error in asNamespace(ns) : not a namespace

It would really be interesting if someone could comment on whether the namespace approach is feasible, how it is supposed to work, and whether/how it would be better than using attach.
Greetings!
Stefan

Hi Stefan,

you need the function makeNamespace() to create the environment as a namespace. Look at the examples in the help files, I found them rather instructive. I also hope someone else chimes in to shed some light on whether or not that approach would be acceptable.

Hi!
Thanks for pointing to the package "namespace".
I experimented with it but I couldn't really figure out how it is supposed to work:

The following code leads to strange errors that I don't understand:

 > nse <- list2env(list(data="x", asdf = 2))
 > namespace::registerNamespace(name = "NewNamespace", env = nse)
 > NewNamespace::asdf
 Error in asNamespace(ns) : not a namespace

It would really be interesting if someone could comment on whether the namespace approach is feasible, how it is supposed to work, and whether/how it would be better than using attach.
Greetings!
Stefan

When I execute the example, I also get a strange behaviour:

 library(namespace)
 ns <- makeNamespace("myNamespace")
 assign("test",7, env=ns)
 ls(env=ns) 

When I now want to invoke any help for a function, I get a warning message:

 > ?loadNamespace
 Warning message:
 In find.package(if (is.null(package)) loadedNamespaces() else package, :
 there is no package called ?myNamespace?

Also sessionInfo doesn't work any more:

 > sessionInfo()
 Error in if (pkgpath == "") { : argument is of length zero

I don't think this is a good sign....

You're right, that's enough to not dig any further. I remembered it from the earlier days of devtools, but they removed that dependency ages ago. I also believe now the namespace package predates the later changes to the namespace mechanism. Forget what I said, I should have spent a bit more time testing it myself first.

Kind regards

Message-ID: <CAJiVmSBKg9OeVh5U76m9w+f6YWsruw4ZD9bMyX4ZpsxuY6Wpgg@mail.gmail.com>

I submitted the Package AQLSchemes on Dec 9, 2019. I corrected the errors
noted in the manual inspection and resubmitted it on Jan 9. I got the
message that it passed the automatic checks and was awaiting manual
inspection. I have not heard anything since.  Do I need to resubmitt the
package? Or how can I find out if this package is still in the queue for
manual inspection?

Thank you

 ? foghorn::cran_incoming() will let you inspect the package queue.

 ? (most likely if the package has been sitting this long it's not ever 
going to move farther through the queue and you should resubmit.? An 
e-mail to the CRAN maintainers after you check the status would probably 
be appropriate.)

As the CRAN policy document says under Submission, you can see the queue 
by looking at ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/.  The foghorn package 
makes this really easy:  you run foghorn::cran_incoming("AQLSchemes") to 
see where your package is sitting.  It doesn't appear to be there at all.

Next time, I'd follow up if you go a week without hearing a reply; 
waiting 3 months seems a bit long.

AFAIK, no, though if the upstream package cannot (or won't) be implemented without that system requirement and it really is a requirement for this package then you might want to indicate "libzzz via Package X" just to be clear for users. If it isn't a requirement for most of your functionality then you may want to use Suggests to alleviate the problem.

When I try to R CMD check --as-cran the EdSurvey package for submission on R-devel I get this error:

So, I went into R and tried installing car, and that  appears to exit cleanly (at end of message). But then I still got the same (above) message.

I made sure the .libPath was the one in R-devel/library.

What can I do to test my package on R-devel?

Hello,
All packages with vignettes are having this error in r-patched-osx-x86_64:

    dyld: Symbol not found: ____chkstk_darwin
     Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/pandoc (which was built for Mac OS X

    Error: processing vignette 'topography.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:

For example:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_mdsumner_at_gmail.com.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_santaR.html

I wonder if it will affect future submissions (having the same error in 2
submissions)

Dear Francisco

It is hard to answer this without more details. If you mean to update a 
package which you have on CRAN then the CRAN policy document has a short 
section on re-submission at the very end. If it is a private package not 
for distribution then you just update the version in the DESCRIPTION file.

Michael

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R CMD check failure during vignette rebuilding
Message-ID: <CAM2gKPZfgke_+p5ZGhmWpmRXV=+ccykxgFtuhuwSqiTn5frb1g@mail.gmail.com>

I have a package vignette that reproducibly fails the second time
round in `R CMD check`, in the ?checking re-building of vignette
outputs? step.

I have uploaded a small reprex to GitHub [1]. But in a nutshell the
vignette contains a subfolder `foo`, and a file `foo/bar`. And the
`test.rmd` vignette contains the following R code:

> newfile = file.path(getwd(), 'foo', 'baz')
> writeLines('baz', newfile)

This code causes `R CMD check` to delete the folder `foo` inside
`00_pkg_src/vignettes` after building the vignette, leading to the
following error message further down the line:

>   Error(s) in re-building vignettes:
>     ...
>   --- re-building ?test.rmd? using rmarkdown
>   Quitting from lines 8-10 (test.rmd)
>   Error: processing vignette 'test.rmd' failed with diagnostics:

>   --- failed re-building ?test.rmd?

This seems to be due to the cleanup after building vignettes inside
`tools::buildVignette`, because creating a file inside a folder
changes the directory subfolder modification time (on POSIX-like
systems) so the whole folder is deleted in cleanup, rather than just
the file. Can I prevent this?

Normally the checks don't want you to be writing files outside of the 
temp dir, because if a user processed your vignette, it might stomp on 
their files.  So can't you change that code to

   dir.create(tempdir(), 'foo')
   newfile <- file.path(tempdir(), 'foo', 'baz')

Hi Duncan,

Thanks for the explanation. Using a temporary directory is what I?m
doing at the moment as a workaround.

What confused me was that `R CMD check` *already* works inside a new
directory (a set of different ones, in fact), and it doesn?t seem to
be documented anywhere that this is the intended behaviour (the
documentation of `buildVignettes` only mentions it removes ?newly
created ? files?, not existing folders), so I thought creating
temporary files under `vignettes` was fair game. Could you clarify
whether this behaviour (deleting existing folders during cleanup) is
intentional? If so, could it be documented more explicitly??

No, I can't tell you whether the behaviour you saw was intentional or 
not, I didn't write it.  But the CRAN policy (which is the motivation 
for many of the checks) says "Packages should not write in the user?s 
home filespace (including clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file 
system apart from the R session?s temporary directory (or during 
installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should 
be cleaned up)."

Hello, 

I'm having trouble re-submitting a package (graph4lg). 

- With r-patched_osx, vignette rebuilding fails with the following message :

I was told this was a transient problem on the MacOS build system:  the 
pandoc installed there was defective.  I don't know if it has been fixed 
yet.

Generally something needed only for the vignettes should be in Suggests 
rather than Imports.

It sounds like someone slipped up.  It might have been you (sending the 
wrong file, or looking at the wrong check log), or maybe CRAN.  In 
either case, I don't think there's anything you can do other than check 
that you're submitting the right file (use a new version number) after 
fixing the Rdpack issue.

Just add 

importFrom(Rdpack,  reprompt) 

in the NAMESPACE file (any function from Rdpack will do).

 Hi,

I submitted my package in CRAN and always appearance the next NOTE.

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: for detritus in the temp directory, Result: NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
    'RtmpcDoRWjr.nc'

I have tried to solve it in several ways (like if(interactive()), but I not
sure how can I solve it.

Thanks.

Kind regards

How was the file created?  What the check wants is that you delete it 
when you are finished with it.  You can use the unlink() function to do 
that.

Or better create it in tempdir(): I guess you used paste(tempdir(), ...) 
instead of file.path() and got afilename one level above tempdir()?

Message-ID: <077d016e-57ee-f878-4955-6ec4a394729d@auckland.ac.nz>


I'm writing a package (just for my own use, for the time being at least)
that contains a function for estimating the parameters of a 
distribution.  The function is essentially a wrapper for fitdistr() from 
the MASS package.

When I looked at RShowDoc("KEYWORDS"), I could not find an appropriate 
keyword to use in the help file for this function.  There's "htest & 
Statistical Inference", but that's not right, since this function is 
about estimation, not hypothesis testing.  I'd hoped that there'd be a 
keyword "estimation" (or "point estimation") or something like that, but 
there isn't.

I guess I can use "utilities" (???) or "misc", but these seem a bit 
unsatisfactory.

Can anyone suggest a better idea?

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Don't use any keyword. When was the last time you searched on one?

I have *never* in my life searched on a keyword! :-)

I just thought that it was an Immutable Law of the Universe that a help 
file had to have at least one keyword, and that the R Gods would rain 
fire and brimstone down upon one's head if no keyword was supplied.

In a similar vein:  would the R Gods allow me to make up my own keyword 
rather than choosing from those listed by RShowDoc("KEYWORDS")?

Thanks.

cheers,

Rolf

You can get away with a lot if you are not distributing your package. But I usually try to satisfy R CMD check at least.

keywords are not mandatory.

You can invent your own keywords and use them in

\concept{}
entries.

Thank you, Renaud, and Bill Dunlap.

There is obviously a bit of a problem there, but it may well be
"only" a problem in error handling.

As Bill's  trace(get, ..)  shows,  R tries to get
"#HAS_DUPLICATE_CLASS_NAMES"   which is indeed an indication of the problem:

You are trying to  *RE*define a class union that already exists
*identically* in the Matrix package:
In the R-forge development version of 'Matrix', it is
line 717 of  Matrix/R/AllClass.R   (and that will be close also
     	     			    in the CRAN version of Matrix).
				    
So at least for you, Renaud, the solution to the problem is easy:
Just don't do what you should not do: What you want is already
part of Matrix.... and after searching:  It's been part of
Matrix since ca. July 2012 ...

--
But yes, there's a buglet in the 'methods' package currently,
which leads to a misleading error message
(It's arguable if it *should* give an error which it did not previously;
 I think it would be quite a good idea to give at least a
 warning as you are masking class definition of the Matrix
 package which is in your search() path or at least among the
 loaded namespaces at this time).

Best,
Martin

Thanks for your answers.
This a part of my script where it creates files and saves it in anything
path. I am not pretty secure how use file.path() or tempdir(). Can you give
me more details about it, please?

 if (!exists("path_pet")){
    path_pet <- getwd()
  } else if (!exists("path_p")){
    path_p <- getwd()
  } else if (!exists("path_p") | !exists("path_pet")){
    path_pet <- getwd()
    path_p <- getwd()
  }

  if (file_type == "raster"){
    # ---- identify raster format and loading----
    if (format == "GTiff"){

      if( length(list.files(path_pet, pattern = ".tif")) == 0 | length(
list.files(path_p, pattern = ".tif")) == 0){
        stop("Not avaliable data of precipitation or evapotranspiration")
      }
      pet_files <- list.files(path_pet)
      pet <- raster::stack(paste(path_pet, pet_files, sep = ""))
      p_files <- list.files(path_p)

Kind regards,

The above code should not exist. You are making a package, so you are 
putting it into a function and either looking for the existence of global 
variables (side effects! requiring user to use special variable names! 
this is not good!), or the "path_pet" and "path_p" variables were created 
in your function and you should already know that they exist.

If we assume that "path_pet" and "path_p" are parameters to this package 
function you are writing, like so:

myfunc <- function( x, y, ..., path_pet = getwd(), path_p = getwd() ) {
   ...
}

then the user can let the default be the current working directory, or can 
specify which directories the function should work in. Specifically, when 
you are writing your examples or test code and pretending to be a user, 
you can create a temporary directory and use it like so:

workingdir <- tempdir(TRUE)
result <- myfunc( A, B, path_pet = workingdir, path_p = workingdir )

which means you can then clean up after yourself with

unlink( workingdir, recursive = TRUE )

I don't think this question is really about R packages anymore... if you 
still cannot read the help files to figure out your questions about how to 
do manage temporary files then you should probably make a small 
reproducible example(!!) and post a question on R-help.

I think your advice would probably pass the checks, but it's bad advice, 
because it leaves the user vulnerable to having files wiped out by 
myfunc().

Functions shouldn't write to the current directory unless the user 
explicitly asks for it.

A better header would be

myfunc <- function( x, y, ..., path_pet = temp.dir(), path_p = 
temp.dir() ) {

Then the user has to explicitly code "path_pet = getwd()" to wipe out 
their own files.

I agree that my example was not optimal, but I was trying to duplicate the existing behaviour with the exception of use of global variables.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] debugging memory sanitation errors
Message-ID: <CAKpFkB3wEzjd99-fb39e1p=cTY3yt6dWoJeK20oiGWgbPE9ADA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello so I keep getting my package turned back because of errors detected
by UBSAN. I am trying to catch it using r-hub's platform with UBSAN but
there are no errors thrown there. What would be a good way for me to debug
this.

Obviously I did R CMD check --as-cran on my own machine, and on Travis and
I can't detect a thing.

What surprises me is that this is a runtime error and I wonder why all the
systems I test it on give it a pass...

Thanks for suggestions!

Marcin

check_for_cran() is from the rhub package, right?  You probably need to 
ask the package maintainer, who also maintains the website it was 
working with.

Does `git remote -v` in the repo directory show https://github.com/...
or git at github.com:... or ssh://... URLs?

Can you add the new SSH key on <https://github.com/settings/keys> and
check ~/.ssh/config to make sure that it's used when connecting to
github.com? You can verify that the SSH part of the stack works by
running `ssh git at github.com`:

PTY allocation request failed on channel 0

This sounds like it's using an https:// remote URL, not ssh. But I
might be mistaken.

You were absolutely correct.? The problem was fixed by copying "url = 
git at github.com:<GitHub_user>/<GitHub_repository>.git" from a repository 
where it worked properly into this one, and it worked.

Hi, please reports R-hub issues at https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues

It takes a bit longer to get started when there R-hub is busy. You can
always interrupt the display with CTRL+C / ESC, and then query the
results later:

? rhub::get_check("factorial2x2_0.2.0.tar.gz-6c92f626dae242f7b915c43bbf111e48")

?? factorial2x2 0.2.0: OK

Message-ID: <2147478298.47395542.1587573866435.JavaMail.zimbra@univ-fcomte.fr>

Hello, 

I'm having trouble checking a package (graph4lg). 

With devtools::check_rhub(), I obtain a warning message on Windows Server 2008 

*checking data fro ASCII and uncompressed saves ... OK 
WARNING 
'qpdf' is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs 

I checked that qpdf is intalled. It is, because I have Rtools. 
Rtools is in my environment path 

That's the first time I obtain this message, although I checked my package several times on Rhub. 
I do not obtain similar messages with other checking platforms. 

I thank you in advance 
Regards 
Paul Savary

Hi,

which R version was this? Can you point to a build log?

qpdf is definitely installed on R-hub's Windows machines, and it is
even on the PATH. Maybe the new toolchain did not find it, I have
copied it to a better place now, please try again.

Best,
Gabor

The function actually submits your package to the R-hub builder, see 
?devtools::check_rhub so you having qpdf installed locally does not help.

Looking at the r-hub/wincheck repository, I found this documentation 
file that qpdf is currently not available yet: 
https://github.com/r-hub/wincheck/blob/master/Extra.md

So you probably have to live with this warning.


Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <CAGxFJbSzFEQ2CXbLPGszUoHRjFvkGEK7+r3qUWZZrcCJ1m1Stw@mail.gmail.com>

OS: Mac OSX Catalina
R Version 3.6.3
UTF-8 declared as Encoding in DESCRIPTION file

First, apologies: I'm nearly certain that this has been asked (many
times) before, and I think I know the answer. But I need to verify.

\eqn{...} allows me to insert a few math symbols in .Rd files, but
does not seem to work for symbols equivalent to unicode U+00B0 (degree
sign) and U+00B1 (plus minus sign). That is \eqn{\pm } is not rendered
properly, and there is no degree sign for Latex without adding
packages.  I can enter these as Mac symbols (presumably using UTF-8
encoding)  and they render properly on my machine in the installed
package documentation. But CRAN's winbuilder doesn't like them with
error message:

LaTeX errors found:
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char ? (U+2264)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.

Are there any fixes/workarounds other than a fallback to plain text?

Thanks. Again, my apologies for asking this again, but I just wanted
to be sure my understanding is correct -- or find out where I'm
confused.

My understanding is that \eqn{...} doesn't really work with html, only 
with LaTeX.  You need to do something like:

\eqn{\hat{\theta} \pm 1.96 \times SE}{theta.hat +/- 1.96*SE}

which (for me at least) gives a nicely rendered result in LaTeX -> pdf 
and the kludgy workaround in html.

As for the degree sign I find that \eqn{42^\circ} gives acceptable 
results in LaTeX, but of course doesn't work in html.

My understanding is that if you enclose things like "?" or "?" in 
\enc{...} and have

\encoding{UTF-8}

as the very first line of your *.Rd file, then CRAN won't complain about 
the presence of these symbols.  But this doesn't work inside \eqn{...}; 
there the "\enc{...}" gets rendered literally.

So for html I think you are stuck with the kludgy fallback to plain text.

cheers,

Rolf

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error in \donttest{} not observed with --run-donttest
 option
Message-ID: <000001d61917$92bb9f00$b832dd00$@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I've submitted the v1.5.0 of my R package metan
<https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/metan> a few days ago to fix some errors
related to a recent upgrade of package 'tibble' to version 3.0.0, with
breaking changes described at
<https://tibble.tidyverse.org/news/index.html>.  When checking locally metan
v1.5.0' with "R CMD check --as-cran --run-donttest metan_1.5.0.tar.gz" no
errors were observed (log file attached).

 

On Monday 13, April, I was notified that "Version 1.5.0 still fails in its
\donttest examples, which should work". Looking to the CRAN Package Check
Results page <https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/donttest/metan.out> I
observed an error that occurred because I used a data set with
non-significant genotype effect to compute an index that requires a
significant genotype effect in all trait. Unfortunately, metan was removed
from CRAN because check problems were not corrected in time.

 

Any idea about why I've not observed any error even using  --run-donttest
option locally?  That function's example had not been changed since the
first release, so, I'm also asking myself why this error was observed only
now, after four successful releases on CRAN.

 

I'd appreciate any comment.

Best regards,

Tiago

Thanks, Rolf. This is very helpful.

Actually, I'm not that concerned about latex --> pdf. It's the html
that I want rendered nicely. So I'll see is that \enc{...} approach
works and gets me through the CRAN checks.

Not that the package is a big deal anyway -- just something I hope
might be useful to a few folks on occasion.

Hi,

which R version was this? Can you point to a build log?

qpdf is definitely installed on R-hub's Windows machines, and it is
even on the PATH. Maybe the new toolchain did not find it, I have
copied it to a better place now, please try again.

Best,
Gabor

Just realized that nobody replied to this. So this seems to be a bug
in `R CMD check --as-cran`, it does not ignore the arch specific
examples and tests directories and files. It happens as well if you
run your check on a local windows, not just on R-hub.

Should I open a bug for this?

There is an env var for it called _R_CHECK_THINGS_IN_CHECK_DIR_, but
--as-cran overrides that, so there is not much we can do about it on
R-hub.

Right now this NOTE does not show up in new package submissions, new
package submission probably do not use `--as-cran`, but they set up
their own configuration, which might look like this:
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/CRAN/QA/Uwe/make/incoming_env.bat

Summary: you'll have to ignore this NOTE for now on R-hub and on your machines.

Message-ID: <CAJiVmSDHNQSeRynfBKU5g7hU3hHibaVvZXG3VaeXg6sX=oiTOQ@mail.gmail.com>

My AQLSchemes package has a pdf vignette created with Rmarkdown. I tried to
add a vignette to my daewr package in exactly the same way, by setting the
Description file like the AQLSchemes package Description file with the
statements
Suggests: R.rsp
VignetteBuilder: R.rsp.

In both packages I put the vignette .Rmd file and output .pdf file in the
vignettes directory, and the inst directory is empty

When I run the check on the AQLSchemes  on my local machine, I see the
messages

and the package builds correctly with the vignette

However,  when I run the check on daewr I see the messages

The two packages are set up in the same way. Any insight as to why one
builds with the vignette but the other does not, would be greatly
appreciated.

As far as I know R.rsp doesn't support Rmd vignettes.  I just took a 
quick look at the code, and it appears to support these formats:  .rsp, 
.pdf.asis, .html.asis, .tex, .ltx, .md, .md.rsp.

So you should rename the source file to one of those, or choose a 
different vignette engine.  knitr::rmarkdown is the usual engine to use 
with R Markdown files.

Message-ID: <CAHNFD2BVetqPk=1=8nf_44UkzUpW=s=Mn8VcpMX6eUD-9LnUfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been told to fix the problems that my package 'multistateutils' has on
OSX:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_multistateutils.html

This is seemingly something to do with my Rcpp code, but I can't debug it
on my local (Linux) machine, as when I check my code using Rhub it passes
the checks:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/multistateutils_1.2.4.tar.gz-9295de3b93d746eb93983d33269cf08d

Does anyone have any tips for testing their packages on OSX, or any
OSX-specific issues with Rcpp?

Thanks,
Stuart

Yes -- Rcpp 1.0.4 passed on macOS at CRAN was released there. And only
post-release, many macOS users (who could have tested pre-release) made a lot
of noise concerning issues on their machines.  Eventually, and thanks to
careful digging by Winston, it was seen as being caused by a newer (relative
to what CRAN has) macOS SDK issued by Apple. And Rcpp 1.0.4.6 was prepared
almost three weeks ago, admitted on CRAN about two weeks ago ... but still
only has one out of three binaries for macOS built on CRAN as you see at

   https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html

Given that the _binary_ package for macOS may be useless for you, you could
try to force installation of the _source_ package for your testing.

It should work just fine.

If you want to see more details, see issue #1060 at the Rcpp GitHub repo.

Message-ID: <CAB-BFRrY-RWafC5-KY4qAKpBToOJMYhSiLginE5A-g0aunPPVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

some weeks back I already wrote to CRAN but got no response. So, I post my
question here seeking for advice.

I am trying to publish a package to CRAN. I got rejected once with some
minor change requests. I implemented them and submitted again. This time I
got a whole array of change requests.

The problem is, I am confused since none of the requests is mentioned
anywhere in CRAN policies. So, are those mere suggestions? Are these common
policy now? Has everyone to implement them? How should I proceed?

(In general, I have no problem with complying with CRAN policies, but I am
not sure if these are actually common requirements now or not.)

Copy of the change requests:

***************** quote >>>> **************************************
Please add \value to all .Rd files for exported functions and explain
the functions results in the documentation.
f.i.: time_stamp.Rd
If a function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.
\value{None}.

The \description tag in the .Rd files should be one or two sentences on
how the function works and what it's good for. Don't just repeat the
function name.
F.i.: stats_modus_multi.Rd

An .Rd file title should:
- be capitalized
- not end in a period
- be at most 65 characters long
- exist and stand alone (there must be exactly one title)
Please adjust to these standards and again don't simply repeat the name.
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Documenting-functions
F.i.: stats_modus_multi.Rd

Please fix and resubmit, and document what was changed in the submission
comments.

Stuart,

As a follow-up, the errors are of the '*** caught illegal operation ***'
variety which is frequently seen when different compiled components (and
particularly C++ ones) are out of sync with respect to their toolchains.

So I would suggest a clean rebuild, but given that it is at CRAN that is out
of our hands.

Sorry,  Dirk

I'd say that the changes being requested are all things stated in the 
Writing R Extensions manual, so this falls under the blanket statement 
in the policy that "CRAN hosts packages of publication quality and is 
not a development platform."

> (In general, I have no problem with complying with CRAN policies, but I am

I'd guess the requests will vary depending on who the reviewer is and 
what their mood is, but if you ignore their requests, you're not going 
to put them in a better mood.

The usage of loading this type of data is system.file("extdata", nameoffile, package="nameofpackage")

Is this the correct string to put in the \usage section?  I have tried this, but get errors such as:

Functions or methods with usage in documentation object 'nameoffile' but not in code:
    'system.file'


Has anyone done this recently and have an example to see where I'm going wrong?

This check seems to be new as in the past I simply had lazydata set to true and it passed tests.

Thanks for any help.

Cheers,

Alan Cantin

This is a highly OS-specific dependency. Are you sure you need this? Is it listed in your SystemRequirements entry in your DESCRIPTION file?

Yes, I think I will need it but I did not specify it in my DESCRIPTION file, since I know that this is an OS libs, does adding this will help?

Could you tell us why your package needs it? Perhaps there is a way
to make it an optional dependency.

> since I know that this is an OS libs

It is true that libudev is required for successful bootup of most
desktop and server GNU/Linux installations... not so for *BSDs, macOS,
Solaris, and Windows. I think that libudev (now part of systemd) will
not even build on these platforms.

> does adding this will help?

It will help in the sense of indicating a system requirement that might
not be present on the target system, but won't get you much further.

Is libudev a hard dependency of your package? If yes, CRAN may reject
the package as not portable enough ("Packages will not normally be
accepted that do not run on at least two of the major R platforms.").
If no, consider including a configure script [*] and some #ifdefs in
your code to make the package only depend on libudev when it is
present.

Message-ID: <CAJmOi+OV4WXq7UisayWWgO8Cgt5d7n0M6YCN4C2tW7W-UkJp9Q@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to include some fst files (produced by fst::write_fst) in
inst/extdata so that (a) users can update them between releases and
(b) to take advantage of fst's benefits. However, when I do this and
run R CMD check I get the warning "Found the following executable

I'm not sure whether this qualifies as a "rare false positive" as WRE
mentions, but if it isn't is there a way to include fst files in a
package without raising a warning?

Good idea, it is a very capable format!

That refers to the file modes which will be (in octal notation) 775 or 755.

Turn the execute bit off i.e. make them 664 or 644 and warning goes away.

In short, this has nothing to do with the .fst extension or content.

Dear All,
I maintain a package that has issues 
`sh: whoami: not found` and `sh: git: not found`
(see https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_packager.html),
albeit not having any (declared or undeclared) external
dependencies -- no calls to system() or system2().

It does import functions from CRAN packages `whoami` and `git2r`, though. 
Mysteriously to me, neither
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_git2r.html
nor 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_whoami.html
show any issues.

Has anybody any clue why this is so? 

Thanks anyway,
Dominik Cullmann

Maybe your use of those packages represent use cases that are not tested by those packages. If you pare down your code that triggers these problems to small reproducible examples then you can contribute them to those packages?

Dear Jeff,
thanks for your reply, 
I exactly know, where gitr and whoami are called, since I constitently use the
`::` operator to import from any dependency.
I am pretty sure that I use those packages for intended purposes only.

Furthermore, CRAN reports issues for system calls (made by `git2r` and `whoami`, I guess) 
for my package on r-patched-solaris-x86 only, so I am not sure how to reproduce
them.

Best,
Dominik Cullmann

Yes, but as SystemRequirements are not alsways fullfilled, you should 
test whether these are available before use.

Dear Uwe,
thanks for your reply.
But wouldn't checking for the SystemRequirements be the dependencies' jobs?
Looking at `whoami`'s code (which is basically a single very well structured
and clearly written file of 350 lines including roxygen comments by Gabor Csardi),
I see exactly a single call to system("whoami"), which of course gets caught if it throws an exception and it should be called on windows only. Under solaris I would expect whoami::whoami() to call `id`.
I don't understand why I'm getting this error with  r-patched-solaris-x86.
Gabor, can you help?!

Best, Dominik Cullmann

I am getting this warning which I need to get rid of.



         Found 'exit', possibly from 'exit' (C)

         Found 'stderr', possibly from 'stderr' (C)


I am depending on several C-based software that has many calls for 'exit'  and 'stderr'.   In this case, how can I avoid this warning?


Thanks,

Not use those calls, see Writing R Extensions.

For reference, the file mode was not set as executable; however,
`file` was reporting a particular file (only one of several .fst
files) as a  DOS executable (COM, 0x8C-variant), which according to
comments in the code of "file" appears to be a common false positive.
Converting the character columns to ASCII and changing the order of
the columns changed the output of file to 'data'.  Dropping a column
also prevented the false identification.

Interesting. So the heuristic of looking at the first few bytes was fooled.
Well, stuff happens, esp with heuristics, once N goes to 'really large'  ...

Nice. The check is there to help. It may get things wrong. A good portion of
the traffic on this list is on perceived or actual errors in these checks. So
here you found an actual one, or rather, the reason why info supplied to one
was misleading.

Hi Team,

Based on the logs shared below, I need your help:

1) Windows:

Error: D:/RCompile/recent/R/library/RIBMDB_CLI/clidriver/bin/db2app64.dll: file not recognized: file format not recognized

Question: why is the windows environment unable to recognize the file? What could be the issue?



2) Debian:

Error: package or namespace load failed for 'RIBMDB' in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):

unable to load shared object '/srv/hornik/tmp/CRAN/RIBMDB.Rcheck/00LOCK-RIBMDB/00new/RIBMDB/libs/RIBMDB.so':

  libdb2.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Question: My package requires the clidriver component and as the same is downloaded in temp location the same will not be found. IN my local system there are two ways to have a workaround i.e. --no-test-load during package installation (OR) --no-staged-install during installation. Is there any other way that I can stop the folder being created be stopped from deleting or how to fix the test load issue. In my local system the package works fine even though test load fails.



Please let me know if you need additional details on my package RIBMDB.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rmarkdown vignette yields r inline warning on windows
 build
Message-ID: <431379CC-A390-4F2F-9EAD-5DEFF131E235@sanger.ac.uk>

I am trying to submit a package to CRAN that includes a vignette built using rmarkdown.  It passes fine on the machines I have access to (ubuntu and osx).  When I submit to CRAN using the form, it passes the Debian checks, but fails on windows with the following WARNING:

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                $
l.1030

You may need to add $ $ around a certain inline R expression `r `


I?m really not sure what is causing this error or how to debug it.  I do not have any inline r expressions in my vignette (code here https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX/blob/devel/vignettes/pbmcTutorial.Rmd).  I do have back-ticked expression such as `round`, but they are not executed code.  Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue?

Many thanks,

Matthew

Since you're looking for suggestions and that's all I have:


Could it be the space between the tick mark and the r? For example, does replacing ` round` with `round` (and all other instances) fix the issue?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rmarkdown vignette yields r inline warning on windows build

********************************************************
Caution: This message was sent from outside the University of Manitoba.
********************************************************

I am trying to submit a package to CRAN that includes a vignette built using rmarkdown.  It passes fine on the machines I have access to (ubuntu and osx).  When I submit to CRAN using the form, it passes the Debian checks, but fails on windows with the following WARNING:

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                $
l.1030

You may need to add $ $ around a certain inline R expression `r `


I?m really not sure what is causing this error or how to debug it.  I do not have any inline r expressions in my vignette (code here https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX/blob/devel/vignettes/pbmcTutorial.Rmd).  I do have back-ticked expression such as `round`, but they are not executed code.  Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue?

Many thanks,

Matthew

In R Markdown, you can say, "The number `r round(pi)` will appear as 
"The number 3".? If you write "`round`", it should display "round" in a 
special font for R commands.? Meanwhile "$\sigma > 2\Phi^{-1}(q)$" 
passes the string between the two dollar signs to a LaTeX processor.? If 
you already know this, I apologize for wasting your time with this 
reply.? If you did not know this, it might help you understand the 
problem.? Spencer Graves

Since you're looking for suggestions and that's all I have:



Could it be the space between the tick mark and the r? For example, does replacing ` round` with `round` (and all other instances) fix the issue?

My wild guess is that 'r ' indicates there is an invisible char after 
the r that is not representable in the chosen encoding.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CensSpatial package error.
Message-ID: <CAC7JchBhET3EPdU8unDB_onvtmOQwVFwzD9aaG7GMODvBDkdrg@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening,

My name is Jose and I'm the mantainer of the CensSpatial package. This
package was available as public but it was discharged because a problem
with the geoR orphan package.
That situation was solved and now I'm trying to resubmit the package. The
problem is that when I try to submit it, it does not pass the automatic
incoming checks,* even when I tested it using the function check available
in R studio without errors.*
Apparently is a problem with the OS Linux and Debian but I couldn't
identify it yet. I also tested it using the package rhub and ran
CensSpatial with different OS without results.

I'm provinding below the link to the source package and the error messages,
hoping to get some help from you.

Yoiu see class(N.inv) has length > 1 hence if(cond) has a length > 1 
condition and cannot deal with it (well takes only the first value), 
hence rewrite to, e.g.,

Hi Jos?,

The error message is pretty clear:

Error in if (class(V.inv) == "try-error") return(Inf) :
  the condition has length > 1

Instead of testing for equality of the class, you should use the function "inherits". Then, even if "class(V.inv)" has length greater than one, your condition in the if clause will be exactly TRUE or FALSE.

Best,

Max Turgeon

I progressively chopped bits out of the vignette till the error stopped to identify the error.  It was being caused by inline latex, where I had two %% marks.  I'm not really sure why this broke things, but removing it fixed it.

Thanks,

"fascinating" .. yes, unfortunately, the Rmarkdown related
engines (I suspect pandoc, but haven't thought or digged about it)
are clearly not bug free.

That's been my experience quite frequently when I "exaggerate"
in my use of LaTeX "tricks" in Rmarkdown documents ..

If somebody knows where exactly such cases should be sent, it
may help improving the situation.. I'm really no expert here.

We don't have anything to send, so it's hard to say where to send it.

Put together a minimal reproducible example, and it'll probably be easy 
to work out whether it's R, R Markdown, knitr, Pandoc, or LaTeX that has 
the bug.

(Naturally I suspect it's not R, and past experience makes me think it's 
not LaTeX, but there are still three other possibilities in the list.)

I?m working on max OS-X 10.15.3, using R 4.0.0, and updated Xcode as well as updated tools:

Here?s my setup of a package called Data2LD2. (An update of an existing package Data2LD already on Iran):

Jim,

This is not the list for Rcpp discussions, as the package and its
documentation have been saying for a decade you should subscribe
to the rcpp-devel list.

Allow me to add one item:

I have created many packages using Rcpp.package.skeleton(), but I usually do
NOT supply lists of files. I would consider starting with an empty package,
and adding files as you go along.  For a deeper look it usually helps us most
to actually _see_ the code so if it is in public repo, tell us.

We've seen that error but I don't recall from the top of my head where this
leads.

Overall, I would expect this to be simple to fix. Let's lay out the files as
expect, let's run `compileAttributes()` (if you use Rcpp Attributes as one
should) and let's take it from there.

But let's maybe have that discussion over at rcpp-devel.

Best,  Dirk

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] MacOS flat namespace
Message-ID: <CAOxgwDD=sbCFsYiWyoXwc1OggkVcde1Rn88O6FyCREbki4Y56w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Two months ago I released a package I developed in Debian 9 GCC (
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=uFTIR). The package was accepted on
CRAN, and it can be installed on Windows and Linux machines. However, it is
not working on MacOS. I don't know why. The problem starts after the
installation, as the OS cannot load the compiled code. Cutting the long
paths of CRAN, the problem looks like (for r-oldrel-osx-x86_64):

...
** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?uFTIR? in dyn.load(file,
DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '.../libs/uFTIR.so':
  dlopen(.../libs/uFTIR.so, 6): Symbol not found:
_H5P_CLS_DATASET_CREATE_ID_g
  Referenced from: .../libs/uFTIR.so
  Expected in: flat namespace
 in .../libs/uFTIR.so
Error: loading failed
...
(The missing symbol for r-release-osx-x86_64 is a different
one: _jpeg_resync_to_restart)

I saw this thread (https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/issues/224)
about Rcpp, but CRAN is not using gcc, but clang, so it is not really the
same... although I was lost when they discussed about libc++ and libstdc++.

I also saw this thread from stackoverflow (
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40922814/error-in-dyn-loaddllfile-unable-to-load-shared-object-expected-in-flat-na)
but I don't have a mix between cpp and plain c.

I think that probably has to do with my Makevars file (
https://community.rstudio.com/t/error-during-the-installation-of-utf8-package/4005/2)...
maybe I shouldn't use PKG_LIBS and LDLIBS instead? But if I change it, how
will it affect the -already successful- installations on windows and linux?

The Makevars for Mac and Linux is:

CXX_STD = CXX11
PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) `pkg-config --cflags gdal`
PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)
`pkg-config --libs gdal`

I will appreciate a hint,

Fabio.

_H5P_CLS_DATASET_CREATE_ID_g comes from the HDF5 library. You don't seem 
to use it directly, and is probably a transitive dependency coming from 
gdal, which you do link against, so it seems more like a problem with 
gdal, not with your code. You could double check this by trying to 
compile anything else against that gdal installation and see if it 
works, or the fact that you are compiling an R package.

You will find many people on internet having exactly the same problem 
but in other products, not R. It seems to boil down to a mismatch in how 
hdf5 was compiled, and how hdf5 users (in this case, gdal) compile 
against the library (with/without defining the H5_BUILT_AS_DYNAMIC_LIB 
preprocessor macro). But again, this is probably on gdal's side, not yours.

Make sure you have a proper gdal installation; after that things should 
work. If you want you could be more defensive about this, and add some 
logic to your configure script to test if a binary compiled against gdal 
runs correctly or not, and react accordingly (e.g., if gdal is a strong 
dependency then you don't continue further into the compilation of your 
package).

> (The missing symbol for r-release-osx-x86_64 is a different

No idea, but I'd suspect gdal here again, not your code.

Cheers,

Rodrigo

Hi,
Thank you both very much for your help. Summarizing your comments:
1. There were no problems when installing the package from CRAN on a macOS
Catalina with clang11 and R 4.0.0.
2. Since I don't use any of the objects directly, it is probably a gdal
thing due to an improper(?) installation.

OK, but the problem happens on CRAN during the CRAN checks for the OS X and
macOS system flavors... Does this mean that there might be something wrong
with CRAN gdal installation for OS X and macOS? (I don't think so, plus how
can I check that without bothering CRAN maintainers?)

Although Rodrigo suggestion will work, if I abort the installation I will
fail the CRAN check, which is the reason I'm asking this question...

Thanks once again,

Fabio.

You might want to look at the 'sf' package to see how it handles GDAL 
SystemRequirements.

When I was using MacOS a few years ago I would typically need to make 
GDAL available on my system using the KingChaos distribution of the 
GDAL, GEOS, PROJ bundle whenever there was a major change in macOS. It 
provides a proper framework installation.

If the user has chosen (against the Mac fork's maintainer's advice)? to 
install GDAL and friends using homebrew, there may be difficulty during 
the linkage steps trying to find the headers that will not be in the 
expected directory. If they have gone the homebrew route, then I believe 
there are additional steps needed to establish the proper system 
environment symlinks and/or environment variables. You can probably find 
some discussion in the R-sig-mac mailing list archives. I generally use 
the MarkMail search facility. You can try:


https://markmail.org/search/?q=+list%3Aorg.r-project.r-sig-mac+gdal


 ?You might want to post the question on the R-sig-mac mailing list if 
you remain stuck.

Hi,
[SOLVED]
It was a problem of linking the libraries correctly, as suggested by
Rodrigo Tobar and David Winsemius.
I checked the package in rhub and it was working fine in the
macos-highsierra-release platform, which uses homebrew to install gdal and
proj. These are probably the settings that Bob Rudis used and that's why he
didn't catch the problem. However, the package check did not work ok in the
macos-highsierra-release-cran platform, probably because CRAN uses
KingChaos distribution of GDAL, etc. As I wasn't sure, I opened an issue in
the rhub github page (#372) and G?bor Cs?rdi pointed me in the right
direction.

I saw how rgdal solved its system requirements. I copied their configure.ac
file and targeted my exports to generate an ad-hoc configure file and
ta-dah! it's working ok in both r-hub platforms (and hopefully it will on
cran too). Now I need to prune rgdal configure.ac file to remove all that
it isn't necessary.

Thank you,
Fabio.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Is there an Rtools40 changelog?
Message-ID: <CADPubGRsQFfm6gXRttFi-xq3VaAVkxTDGLxWUMMFbz+-e1TQ+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a maintainer on the LightGBM project, focused on that project's R
package. The R package is not available on CRAN yet (we are working on it),
so for now our users must build it from source.

The package includes compilation of a C++ library, and we link to R.dll /
R.so to use R-provided functions like Rprintf.

With the release of R4.0 and Rtools40, we recently received reports from
our users that they are unable to build our package on Windows systems with
R 4.0 and Rtools 4.0 (https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/3064).

After some investigation, I've learned that the following changes in
Rtools40 (relative to Rtools35) broke our installation process:

   - *gendef.exe* was removed
   - *mingw32-make.exe* was removed
   - paths like "mingw_64/bin" were changed to "mingw64/bin"

I do not expect that our off-CRAN installation process is supported. I
understand that by maintaining our own process, we are taking on the burden
of keeping up with new releases of R and Rtools.

My question is this...is there public documentation about why the changes I
mentioned above were made? I have not found any mention of them in the
following places, and am not sure where else to look.

   - https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
   - https://github.com/r-windows/docs/blob/master/faq.md#readme
   - https://jeroen.github.io/rstudio2019

Thank you very much for your time and consideration,

-James Lamb

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Documentation for non-user-level objects
Message-ID: <9CEB8C27-F083-45E1-A574-A390202BE994@gmail.com>

I met a problem when I uploaded the package to CRAN. There is a warning told me 
?All user-level objects in a package should have documentation entries.?

Actually, those functions are not user-level functions. How could I claim non-user-level functions in an R package.
Is there any idea to remove this warning.

Thanks!

1. Don't export them.

2. Use:  \keyword{ internal } in the .Rd file
>From "Writing R Extensions"
"The special keyword ?internal? marks a page of internal objects that
are not part of the package?s API. If the help page for object foo has
keyword ?internal?, then help(foo) gives this help page, but foo is
excluded from several object indices, including the alphabetical list
of objects in the HTMLhelp system."

Have you exported the function?

 ?? If you've exported them then they are "user-level objects". You can 
either remove them from the list of exported objects (edit your 
NAMESPACE or change your roxygen specifications), or document them 
somewhere.? One standard solution is? to use the "internal" keyword 
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32457581/how-can-i-hide-the-documentation-of-helper-functions>: 
they still need to be documented, but they're not in the package index.

"Using the internal keyword removes all functions in the associated .Rd 
file from the documentation index and disables some of their automated 
tests. A common use case is to both export a function (using |@export|) 
and marking it as internal. That way, advanced users can access a 
function that new users would be confused about if they were to see it 
in the index."


 ? Hope that's helpful; if not, feel free to give a little more 
detail/clarify your situation.

Can you provide a bit more context? I just grabbed the pkg source from CRAN and it builds fine.

Hello everyone,

I have a package which I would like to host on CRAN. The package is at https://github.com/bnosac/golgotha
The package only builds on 64bit however because the package uses R package reticulate which requires a python library called torch which does not build on 32 bit platforms.
So installation only works using INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch"

How do you specify this to the CRAN maintainers that this is the way it should be set up on CRAN such that it only is built for 64bit systems.

thanks,
Jan

I don't see how your package has any 32 bit dependence, since it has no 
src directory.  It's probably sufficient to declare the dependency on 
reticulate, which indirectly implies the 32 bit dependence.  But if 
reticulate works on 32 bit systems as long as users don't need "torch",
then just state that.

One thing I'd recommend:  you should try to change the dependency from 
Depends to Imports.  If there are a few reticulate functions that you 
want your users to have access to, you can import them and re-export 
them so they're available from your package as well.

Duncan,

Thanks for the reply. Let me make this more clear.
The R package reticulate works on 32bit and 64bit. My golgotha package depends on reticulate and an extra Python package called torch which is not available for 32bit platforms. This is specified in the DESCRIPTION file at https://github.com/bnosac/golgotha/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L17

For that reason R CMD check will fail on CRAN for 32bit. Hence my question. How do I specify this in the package such that I can distribute it on CRAN.

best,
Jan

I don't think there's a formal way to state that, and there shouldn't 
be.  Maybe some day someone will make 32 bit torch available, and then 
your restriction would be unnecessary.  Just state the current situation 
in your submission comments.  You may get an automatic rejection because 
of the build failure, then follow the instructions for getting a human 
to look at things.

It's possible that CRAN will not be flexible on this, because it aims 
for wide portability of the packages it hosts.  However, 32 bit systems 
are less and less common, so a good argument about why your package is 
useful even if not usable on some old systems would probably get it 
accepted.

Duncan,

Thanks for the confirmation that there isn't a formal way to state this 64bit dependency.

Hi Jan,

this is the only example that I could find:
https://github.com/cran/regRSM/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L13

I.e. you can have an 'Archs' field in DESCRIPTION, and apparently you
can set that to 'i386' or 'x64' or both.

 I don't know what OSes support this field, and this package hasn't
been updated for a while, so I am not 100% sure, but this definitely
seems like the proper way to declare a 64-bit only package.

Gabor

Hi Jan,

To add to the suggestion of Gabor and Duncan, it might be a good idea to add a packageStartupMessage that warns the user about the problem when running on a 32bit system. You can easily extract that info from R.Version()$arch . That might help negotiating with CRAN.

Kind regards
Joris

Duncan,

Thanks for the reply. Let me make this more clear.
The R package reticulate works on 32bit and 64bit. My golgotha package depends on reticulate and an extra Python package called torch which is not available for 32bit platforms. This is specified in the DESCRIPTION file at https://github.com/bnosac/golgotha/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L17

For that reason R CMD check will fail on CRAN for 32bit. Hence my question. How do I specify this in the package such that I can distribute it on CRAN.

best,
Jan

Related: As CRAN does not give you a hook, approximate one yourself in the
package.  I.e. demote reticulate to a mere Suggests:, then in .onAttach()
check a) if it is present and howl if not as well as b) if on 32 bit and say
you're sorry if so. Obviously, a real switch would be better but ...

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Assigning values to fields in Reference Classes
Message-ID: <83ab0e83-f641-b912-a69b-ab0841831a2d@alipsa.se>

Hi,

I have been playing with alternative ways to assign values to fields in 
reference classes.

Besides the "standard" <<- there are two other ways that also "seems to 
work". One is using .self$fieldName assigned with <- and the the other 
one is field(fieldName, value).

With regards to the ".self method" (example below): is this a "safe" 
equivalent to <<- i.e. are these two ways identical in result and 
possible "side effects"?

StandardAssignment <- setRefClass(
 ? Class ="StandardAssignment",
 ? fields = list(
 ??? m_attributes = "list"
 ? ),
 ? methods = list(
 ??? setAttribute = function(name, value) {
 ????? m_attributes[[as.character(name)]] <<- as.character(value)
 ????? return(invisible(.self))
 ??? },
 ??? getAttribute = function(name) {
 ????? m_attributes[[name]]
 ??? }
 ? )
)

s1 <- StandardAssignment$new()
s1$setAttribute("name", "foo")
s1$getAttribute("name")

[1] "foo"

SelfAssignment <- setRefClass(
 ? Class ="SelfAssignment",
 ? fields = list(
 ??? m_attributes = "list"
 ? ),
 ? methods = list(
 ??? setAttribute = function(name, value) {
 ????? .self$m_attributes[[as.character(name)]] <- as.character(value)
 ????? return(invisible(.self))
 ??? },
 ??? getAttribute = function(name) {
 ????? m_attributes[[name]]
 ??? }
 ? )
)

s2 <- SelfAssignment$new()
s2$setAttribute("name", "foo")
s2$getAttribute("name")

[1] "foo"


Best regards,

Per

What does this have to do with package development? Seems more like a
query for r-help.

I developed a package where reference classes is used a lot. When 
submitting it to CRAN i got the feedback that? i should not use <<- as 
that was "modifying the global environment". That was a misunderstanding 
that was sorted out but before it was, I started to investigate 
alternative ways to assign values to refclass fields. I can it this 
elsewhere since it does not belong.

Thanks,

Per

Good afternoon,


It probably means that in your DESCRIPTION file, you wrote something like

VignetteBuilder: knitr


If you don't have a vignette, you should remove that line.

You really need to read the 'Writing R Extensions" manual, in
particular the section on the DESCRIPTION file. You are asking basic
questions that are covered there.

I see you already got useful answers, but here is a further resource: I wrote a blog post about internal functions earlier this year <https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/12/12/internal-functions/>

I met a problem when I uploaded the package to CRAN. There is a warning told me

Actually, those functions are not user-level functions. How could I claim non-user-level functions in an R package.
Is there any idea to remove this warning.

Hi, Simon et al.


[changing to "R-package-devel, because I've heard complaints that this 
may not be appropriate for R-devel.]


 ????? I'm still having problems.? I found that I had Java twice in the 
path and deleted both versions (~\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-11.0.6.10-hotspot\bin 
and ~Java\jre1.8.0_241). That seemed not to change anything as far as I 
can tell.


 ????? I have both directories for both "~Rtools" and "~rtools40", and 
the path includes "~rtools40\bin".? When running R4.0.0 within RStudio, 
"install.package('rJava', type='source', INSTALL_opts = 
'--merge-multiarch') complained, "WARNING:? Rtools is required ... but 
no version compatible ... was found.? Note that the following 
incompatible versions(s) ... were found:? - Rtools 3.5".? When I run r 
in a CMD prompt, I don't get that warning.? However, both complain,


 ????? warning in system("sh ./configure.win") : 'sh' not found


 ????? When I tried "install.packages('rJava')", it seemed to work OK 
(though I still got the complaint from R within RStudio that it could 
not find rtools40).


 ????? And my primary problem is unchanged:? "R CMD check 
Ecfun_0.2-4.tar.gz" ends with the following:


Error:? package or namespace load failed for 'Ecfun':
 ? .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details
 ?? call: inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...)
 ?? error:? unable to load shared object 'c:/Program
Files/R/R-4.0.0/library/rJava/libs/i386/rJava.dll':
 ?? LoadLibrary failure: ^1 is not a valid win32 application


 ????? The same package on my Mac quits with a LaTeX error I have yet to 
figure out how to fix.


 ????? Suggestions?
 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

Better don't set PATH or JAVA_HOME as it will stop rJava from working if you get it wrong. The errors on Windows are confusing, the actual error is shown via GUI as pop-up, what they report in the console is not the real error.

Some utilities that were previously bundled with all rtools
installations can now be installed with the package manager.

To install gendef use:

     pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-tools

To install mingw32-make.exe use:

      pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-make

To install both of the at once you can use:

      pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-{tools,make}

Note that it's often better to use 'make.exe' which is included with
all rtools installations instead of mingw32-make.exe.

These changes were a result of switching to an msys2 based toolchain.
The default rtools40 installer only includes the things needed to
build CRAN packages or base-R. Extra stuff such as system libraries,
debuggers, cmake, etc, are all optionally available via the package
manager.

Hi Jos?,

The error message is pretty clear:

Error in if (class(V.inv) == "try-error") return(Inf) :
? the condition has length > 1

Instead of testing for equality of the class, you should use the function "inherits". Then, even if "class(V.inv)" has length greater than one, your condition in the if clause will be exactly TRUE or FALSE.

Best,

Max Turgeon

Good evening,

My name is Jose and I'm the mantainer of the CensSpatial package. This
package was available as public but it was discharged because a problem
with the geoR orphan package.
That situation was solved and now I'm trying to resubmit the package. The
problem is that when I try to submit it, it does not pass the automatic
incoming checks,* even when I tested it using the function check available
in R studio without errors.*
Apparently is a problem with the OS Linux and Debian but I couldn't
identify it yet. I also tested it using the package rhub and ran
CensSpatial with different OS without results.

I'm provinding below the link to the source package and the error messages,
hoping to get some help from you.

Hello,

I don't think you have to (and shouldn't?) document raw data. However, you can use it in examples/tests/etc. using the system.file() command you mention.

But maybe you want to export the data? In that case it should be under data/.

This chapter of the R packages book might be useful <https://r-pkgs.org/data.html> (as well as <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Data-in-packages>).

Hi Folks,

Looking for some help documenting my raw data (data in inst/extdata).

Is the correct doctype "data"?

The usage of loading this type of data is system.file("extdata", nameoffile, package="nameofpackage")

Is this the correct string to put in the \usage section?? I have tried this, but get errors such as:

Functions or methods with usage in documentation object 'nameoffile' but not in code:
? ? 'system.file'


Has anyone done this recently and have an example to see where I'm going wrong?

This check seems to be new as in the past I simply had lazydata set to true and it passed tests.

Thanks for any help.

Spencer, I guess you have 64 bit components on the path before the new 
toolchain is found.

Also  check at first if you can load rJava both under 32-bit RGui and 
64-bit RGui.

If this does not help: Can you send me privately the full output (i.e. 
including check.log and also install.out file)?

Best,
Uwe

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] clang11 CRAN check and use of Eigen
Message-ID: <CAG=M9LpvRWJA3=0mDyFbQw5TNAjcE5=RDAZnk4L2YTw9WxrbGw@mail.gmail.com>

As of some point recently (at least since January) our package
(nimble) is being flagged by CRAN's clang11 check. The check reports
various errors when compiling one of our C++ files that makes use of
code from the Eigen C++ package, which we include with our package.
Here's the report from CRAN:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/clang11/nimble.log

Similar errors are occurring for a few other packages on CRAN (some
that directly include Eigen and others that do so via RcppEigen).

1) Does anyone happen to know why this problem with Eigen is occurring
with clang11?

2) Given clang11 is not yet released, perhaps CRAN is simply flagging
this for the future. I'm hoping we can still release our next version
without addressing this, and I see that some of the other packages
this affects have released recently (e.g., prophet) seemingly without
addressing the issue. Does anyone know CRAN's policy in this regard?

thanks,

The errors are all around std::ostream.  My guess is that Eigen is missing
an #include.  The missing include was probably included transitively in
earlier versions of clang, but clang11 cleaned up some files that didn't
need that include themselves, and the downstream file got broken as a
result.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] MathJax for Rd files
Message-ID: <000001d628f3$6eccfc60$4c66f520$@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to make this question, but here I
am.

I'm trying to use MathJax for html help files in my package metan
(https://cran.r-project.org/package=metan)

I have success with the following approach:

 

Including the following call

 

#'\if{html}{\out{

#'<script id="MathJax-script" async

#'src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax at 3.0.5/es5/tex-chtml-full.js">

#'  </script>

#'}} 

 

And then typing the equations I need. A simple example bellow

 

#' \ifelse{html}{\out{\[\sqrt{a^2}\]}}{\deqn{\sqrt{a^2}}}

 

Is there any way to put "tex-chtml-full.js" locally so that everyone that
has my package installed see the equations rendered properly even offline?

Thanks in advance

Olivoto

I doubt it. CRAN, and one tireless operator in particular, are relentless in
chasing upcoming changes _early_ to give you time.

That, one comes to realize after a while, really is a feature.

The nag emails are painful each time, but this is one of the many small
technical details CRAN has gotten right, enforces, and thus ensures quality.

Yes. They will likely ask you to update your code "or else".

[ Now, with large (external) code bases this is also royal PITA. I happen to be
the maintainer of BH and RcppEigen, and both can create an unbelievable long
and annoying list of compiler warnings. If it were up to me, I'd suppress
them.  But my opinion doesn't matter, so the warning are there. ]

CRAN built the sandbox. A nice one, actually. And they still extend it.  We
just get to play in it.

So in short I would try to adjust the package.

Cheers,  Dirk

Dear Wolfgang,
Thank you so much for the awesome package
I've installed mathjaxr and it worked.
I have some more questions, with a short example bellow
I created an equation in my mgidi.R file as follows

#' \loadmathjax
#' \mjsdeqn{MGIDI_i = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^f}

And then I ran devtools::document()
The mgidi.Rd contains

\loadmathjax
\mjsdeqn{MGIDI_i = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^f}

But when I try to preview the current document as HTML, the equation is not
rendered and the help page shows
\loadmathjax \mjsdeqnMGIDI_i = \sum\limits_j = 1^f
The equation is only rendered after I install my package locally with
devtools::install(). Is this an expected behavior?

Another question is regarding more complex formulae.
I tried using
#' \loadmathjax
#' \mjsdeqn{MGID{I_i} = {\left[ {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^f {{{\left( {{F_{ij}} -
{F_j}} \right)}^2}} } \right]^{0.5}}}

Even after installing the package locally the equation is not rendered in
the html help page, which shows the tex command. 
I tested the same equation with https://www.mathjax.org/#demo and it seems
to be ok.
Have I missed anything or used any code not supported by mathjaxr?
Thanks in advance
Olivoto

Dear Olivoto,

There is a package now for this purpose:

https://cran.r-project.org/package=mathjaxr

Seems like you are using roxygen2. I have little experience with that, as all my Rd files are 'handcrafted' (plus 100% organic and biodegradable).

But what specifically do you mean by "when I try to preview the current document as HTML"? Is this some particular functionality of roxygen2 / devtools / RStudio? Or do you simply mean using tools::Rd2HTML()? Then you will have to use permissive=TRUE so that the macros from mathjaxr (which will not be recognized by default by parse_Rd()) are just passed through as text. Or you could try adjusting the 'macros' argument, maybe in combination with loadPkgRdMacros(), to specify that the mathjaxr macros should be loaded. See help(Rd2HTML, package="tools") and help(parse_Rd, package="tools") for details.

But if I want to see the HTML help file, I just install and load the package and call up the help file on some function. That works for sure.

As for the more complex equation - it includes a lot of curly braces. See the note I added recently to the 'devel' version about this:

https://github.com/wviechtb/mathjaxr#issues

Best,
Wolfgang

As are mine. ;-)
In the HTML-preview of RStudio the LaTeX is indeed not parsed. I get it 
only (in the HTML man-page and the PDF) if I build the package.

Thanks for the info! Can confirm now that I tried this (I don't usually use RStudio). That's an RStudio issue then. My guess is that 'Preview' uses tools::Rd2HTML() and that indeed won't automatically understand macros coming from mathjaxr (or any add-on package for that matter). This would be an issue to raise with the RStudio folks then.

But once a package is installed, the equations are nicely rendered also in the RStudio help browser, so that part works.

Best,
Wolfgang

Thanks, Wolfgang and Helmut for the explanations.
When I was trying to use

#'\if{html}{\out{'<script id="MathJax-script" async
#''src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax at 3.0.5/es5/tex-chtml-full.js
#'</script> }}
#'
#'And then typing
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{\[\sqrt{a^2}\]}}{\deqn{\sqrt{a^2}}}
My mgidi.Rd file was produced with devtools::document();
then, I just used ?mgidi, and the html page was rendered nicely.

If I could do the same with mathjaxr, It would be nice, because I wouldn't need to install the package to see if the equations are as I expect
Anyway, mathjaxr is a very useful package.
Congratulations on the efforts for developing it.

Sounds like it's a devtools issue.  I don't know how they are simulating 
the install, but it needs to say to use the mathjaxr macros when 
converting the Rd pages.

Thanks, Duncan. I was about to respond to suggest the same thing.

One way of getting this to work:

Sys.setenv(MATHJAXR.USECDN = "TRUE")
Rd <- file.path("<path>/<file>.Rd") # specify the .Rd file you want to preview
outfile <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")
browseURL(tools::Rd2HTML(Rd, outfile, macros="<path to library where mathjaxr is installed>/mathjaxr/help/macros/mathjax.Rd"))

Best,
Wolfgang

Thank you so much! It works!
In my example, I've created a simple helper function, preview_rd()

preview_rd <- function(rdfile){ # without '.rd'
Rd <- file.path(paste("man/", rdfile, ".rd", sep = "")) # specify the .Rd file you want to preview
outfile <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")
browseURL(tools::Rd2HTML(Rd, outfile, macros="D:/Documents/R/win-library/4.0/mathjaxr/help/macros/mathjax.Rd"))
}

I added the macros \loadmathjax and \mjsdeqn in the mgidi.R file, ran devtools::document() and then preview_rd("mgidi")
The html was rendered nicely (in my browser) and shows the equation without installing the package.
That's what I was looking for.
Thanks again!
Olivoto

Glad to hear that. I might consider adding a function along those lines to mathjaxr itself, to make it easier to preview files while working on a help page.

Best,
Wolfgang

Good to hear.  I'd suggest this way to find the macros:

   browseURL(tools::Rd2HTML(Rd, outfile, macros = 
system.file("help/macros/mathjax.Rd", package = "mathjaxr")))

so that it works if you use it on a different system that puts the 
library somewhere else.

Definitively this is a better way to find the macros.
I think a function like 'preview_rd()' could be useful in mathjaxr

Thanks for all support

Good to hear.  I'd suggest this way to find the macros:

   browseURL(tools::Rd2HTML(Rd, outfile, macros = system.file("help/macros/mathjax.Rd", package = "mathjaxr")))

so that it works if you use it on a different system that puts the library somewhere else.

I've added a preview_rd() function to the 'devel' version of mathjaxr:

https://github.com/wviechtb/mathjaxr

If you want to give this a try:

remotes::install_github("wviechtb/mathjaxr")
library(mathjaxr)

Then set the working dir to the root of the package you are working on. Then use:

preview_rd(Rdfile)

with the name of the Rd file given as a character string (either with or without the .Rd/.rd extension).

By default, the browser (or a new tab in your browser) should open up. But if you then make further changes to the Rd file, opening up a new tab each time is inconvenient. Use:

preview_rd(Rdfile, view=FALSE)

to prevent that (then just refresh the page in the open tab in your browser to see the updates).

One limitation: As far as I can tell, it will not be possible to load MathJax from the mathjaxr package when using preview_rd(). So, it will be loaded via the CDN, which means that you need an internet connection for equations to render.

Best,
Wolfgang

I installed the 'devel' version of mathjaxr and tested preview_rd()
All seems to be working fine!
Thank you for the quick and useful implementation!

Thank you very much for the help!

This definitely answered my question. I wasn't familiar with pacman before.

For the curious, I've had success generating a .def file from R.dll with
*objdump.exe*, a utility that exists in prior Rtools distributions and
the current ones. With something like the R code below.

```r

#     Create a definition file (.def) from a .dll file, using objdump.
#
# [usage]

#     Rscript make-r-def.R something.dll something.def

#    * https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/doc/mingwfaq.html

args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

IN_DLL_FILE <- args[[1L]]
OUT_DEF_FILE <- args[[2L]]
DLL_BASE_NAME <- basename(IN_DLL_FILE)

print(sprintf("Creating '%s' from '%s'", OUT_DEF_FILE, IN_DLL_FILE))

# use objdump to dump all the symbols
OBJDUMP_FILE <- "objdump-out.txt"
exit_code <- system2(
    command = "objdump"
    , args = c(
        "-p"
        , shQuote(IN_DLL_FILE)
    )
    , stdout = OBJDUMP_FILE
)

objdump_results <- readLines(OBJDUMP_FILE)
result <- file.remove(OBJDUMP_FILE)

# Only one table in the objdump results matters for our purposes,
# see https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/doc/mingwfaq.html
start_index <- which(
    grepl(
        pattern = "[Ordinal/Name Pointer] Table"
        , x = objdump_results
        , fixed = TRUE
    )
)
empty_lines <- which(objdump_results == "")
end_of_table <- empty_lines[empty_lines > start_index][1L]

# Read the contents of the table
exported_symbols <- objdump_results[(start_index + 1L):end_of_table]
exported_symbols <- gsub("\t", "", exported_symbols)
exported_symbols <- gsub(".*\\] ", "", exported_symbols)
exported_symbols <- gsub(" ", "", exported_symbols)

# Write R.def file
writeLines(
    text = c(
        paste0("LIBRARY \"", DLL_BASE_NAME, "\"")
        , "EXPORTS"

The issue is not with Rstudio per se but that in devtools' development mode  help() is modified to show the Rd files in the source directory, as one would expect, but doesn't load the RdMacros. So, the issue appears when one is development mode. 

Rdpack::viewRd() can be of some help but it currently loads only the RdMacro's from its package.

Thanks for the info! Can confirm now that I tried this (I don't usually use RStudio). That's an RStudio issue then. My guess is that 'Preview' uses tools::Rd2HTML() and that indeed won't automatically understand macros coming from mathjaxr (or any add-on package for that matter). This would be an issue to raise with the RStudio folks then.

But once a package is installed, the equations are nicely rendered also in the RStudio help browser, so that part works.

Best,
Wolfgang

Yes, the error appears to be in the pkgload::load_rd_macros() function 
here: 
https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload/blob/1b1adc39628671f2ea4256f0bebcdb76e1f89f45/R/dev-help.r#L47.

It doesn't look at the DESCRIPTION file to see if there's an RdMacros entry.

Isn't that what tools::loadPkgRdMacros() does there? I believe so.

Yes, you're right.  So it's not clear why the preview isn't working.

I don't know if this helps but I have the following note in  viewRd() (from 2017!) at https://github.com/GeoBosh/Rdpack/blob/81af94d0e690b9f02275e89d474ce184d63fb044/R/bib.R

...
    ## TODO: (BUG) e is NULL under RStudio
    e <- tools::loadPkgRdMacros(system.file(package = "Rdpack"))
## Rdo <- parse_Rd(infile, macros = e)
...

Maybe I have forgotten to delete the note after fixing that since it works  (I just checked in Rstudio) but maybe that's the reason I restricted it to just macros in Rdpack.

I think I've tracked it down correctly this time.

The problem appears to be in RStudio code called by 
pkgload::print.dev_Topic. That function correctly loads the macros, but 
has this code:

     if (rstudioapi::hasFun("previewRd")) {
       rstudioapi::callFun("previewRd", x$path)
       return(invisible())
     }

(This is here: 
https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload/blob/1b1adc39628671f2ea4256f0bebcdb76e1f89f45/R/dev-help.r#L68 
.)

This never passes the macros to the preview code built in to RStudio. 
The function in RStudio is here: 
https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/2596a760603e06251cce829f236f57c5eff048c9/src/cpp/r/R/Api.R#L101 
.  It only accepts one argument, rather than the two that are needed.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Help Debugging Debian Error
Message-ID: <CANA-rNN-m5d-FPt8ZCSWNWdLOTA-LV8o-GWU_zLbGMKoi+m5tA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

At some point (I believe within the last week or so), my package
`PAutilities` has developed the following error for
r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc:

* checking tests ... [3s/3s] ERROR
  Running ?testthat.R? [3s/3s]
Running the tests in ?tests/testthat.R? failed.
Complete output:
  > library(testthat)
  > library(PAutilities)
  package 'PAutilities' was built under R version 3.5.0
  >
  > test_check("PAutilities")

I get the same error using `rhub::check_on_debian`, but not
`rhub::check(platform = "debian-gcc-devel")`.

So far, my best guesses have been that issues were caused by either a
dependency problem (particularly the `matchingMarkets` package, which
has given me trouble in the past), or with the major increment in R
itself. But so far neither of those ideas have yielded much fruit. Any
other ideas, considerations, or things I should be aware of? I'm
working on installing a virtual machine to see about some manual
debugging, but I would love some guidance in the meantime.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] package submission rejected "checking CRAN incoming
 feasibility ... NOTE"
Message-ID: <1519218419.549411.1589479355957.JavaMail.zimbra@unistra.fr>

Dear expeRts, 

when trying to submit a new package of mine, my submission was rejected during automic incoming checks. 
In fact on Windows it says Status: 1 NOTE 
This note says: 
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Wolfgang Raffelsberger <w.raffelsberger at unistra.fr>'

New submission 
On my previous submissions I always had this message and it never posed a problem. 
When reading up on this issue I also find no suggestions how to avoid or explanations what problem this reflects to, see [ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23829978/checking-cran-incoming-feasibility-note-maintainer | https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23829978/checking-cran-incoming-feasibility-note-maintainer ] . 

Automatic checking on Debian also lists a second NOTE concerning the presence of files not directly related to my package : 
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  ?calibre_4.99.5_tmp_4_1f_nbo? ?calibre_4.99.5_tmp_94i_sjvs?
  ?calibre_4.99.5_tmp_l2if0v8a? ?calibre_4.99.5_tmp_oxc2vtjx?
  ?runtime-hornik?
* DONE
Status: 2 NOTEs 

These packages seem to be related to files generated during the automatic checks... 

What do you suggest ? 
Thank's in advance, 
Wolfgang

Hm, doesn't that simply mean that this r-hub box is out of sync?

So maybe file an issue at the rhub github repo, and test with another of the
(many!)  available platforms at rhub -- run rhub::platforms() to see.

It is unlikely that this is an R-hub issue because the first link is
CRAN's machine, and the same error happens there.

I can reproduce it on macOS:

git clone https://github.com/paulhibbing/PAutilities
R CMD INSTALL PAutilities

R -q -e 'packageDescription("PAutilities")$Built'
#> > packageDescription("PAutilities")$Built
#> [1] "R 3.6.2; x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0; 2020-05-15 01:24:03 UTC; unix"

R -q -e "library(PAutilities)"
#> > library(PAutilities)
#> package 'PAutilities' was built under R version 3.5.0

I have no clue how this can happen, I clearly just built it on R 3.6.3

Apparently, this is not a warning, but the package itself is printing
it as a startup message:

Ah, I hadn't considered that the startup message could be the problem
- I thought the point of startup messages was to be distinct from
errors and warnings, so I wouldn't have expected that to trip up R CMD
Check. I assumed the failure was occurring somewhere inside the actual
code for my unit tests... I will see if removing the startup message
fixes things.

Removing the startup message did not resolve the issue. Now I have just:

It seems to me that the R process crashes while running your tests, but
since testthat::test_check captures everything to summarise it later,
you don't get to know where the crash occurs.

Perhaps if you (temporarily) move your tests out of testthat/
subdirectory and remove the context() and testthat::test_that("...",
{ ... }) calls, you would be able to see the exact location of the
crash in the *.Rout files?

That said, it's probably one of your dependencies that's responsible
for the crash, not your package, since there is no compiled code.

You don't need to move the files around, though, just use a more
verbose testthat reporter, e.g. in testthat.R use

test_check("PAutilities", reporter = "summary")

and then at least you'll know where it crashes. But to fix this,
you'll probably need to debug it locally. You can do that in Docker if
you don't have a local Linux machine.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package submission failed with two warnings
Message-ID: <1589517991120.72a63db72c4c0170@susaenergy.com>

Dear R-package-devel experts,

This is the first time I?m writing to this platform about a package I recently submitted to CRAN (my first package).
While the package is already available on CRAN, I still must fix a few warnings and one error as reported on the CRAN package check results page:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Rpvt.html

I recently resubmitted a modified version of the package to CRAN, however, it didn?t pass the automatic incoming checks. 

Windows:  https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/Rpvt_0.1.0_20200512_051950/Windows/00check.log
Status: 1 WARNING

Debian:  https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/Rpvt_0.1.0_20200512_051950/Debian/00check.log
Status: 2 WARNINGs


1) The first warning that appears on both Windows and Debian results is ?Insufficient package version (submitted: 0.1.0, existing: 0.1.0)?.

Since the package is conditionally available on CRAN, do I need to modify the package version to 0.1.1 to get rid of this warning?
Is there any way to fix this problem with the current version of the package(0.1.0)?

2) The second problem appears on the Debian test results:
    
    * checking re-building of vignette outputs ... [8s/8s] WARNING 
    
    Error(s) in re-building vignettes: 
    ...

    SUMMARY: processing the following file failed: 
    ?Rpvt.Rmd? 
    
    Error: Vignette re-building failed. 
    Execution halted

I?ve created this package on a Windows operating system with no problem in creating the ?Rpvt.Rmd? file as is the case with the CRAN tests on x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit).
Why does it fail to create the ?Rpvt.Rmd? file on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (Debian)? Is this something related to the citation style of the library.bib file that I?ve used in my vignettes folder? It is the ?apa-6th-edition.csl? file downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa-6th-edition.csl

Thank you in advance!

Regards,
Farshad

"Package authors should make all reasonable efforts to provide
cross-platform portable code. Packages will not normally be accepted
that do not run on at least two of the major R platforms. Cases for
Windows-only packages will be considered, but CRAN may not be the most
appropriate place to host them.""

You might want to use win-builder (https://win-builder.r-project.org/)
to test your package on other platforms.

All the best,

For your first warning, see the CRAN policy:  "Updates to 
previously-published packages must have an increased version. Increasing 
the version number at each submission reduces confusion so is preferred 
even when a previous submission was not accepted."

For the second, it's hard to say what's happening.  Is your package 
online somewhere so we could try it on different machines?

Hi Duncan,

I changed the version, recreated the package, and then tested it with the rhub::check_for_cran(). The function failed to create a summary for all the platform results together, however individual results are available in the following links.


https://builder.r-hub.io/status/Rpvt_0.1.1.tar.gz-5e89b16f7bfb420ebe310a57eb8357b3

https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/Rpvt_0.1.1.tar.gz-08fc2dbd591f4d80b2e0049a7c8db8b8

you can also find the source code in the following link:

For your first warning, see the CRAN policy:  "Updates to 
previously-published packages must have an increased version. Increasing 
the version number at each submission reduces confusion so is preferred 
even when a previous submission was not accepted."

For the second, it's hard to say what's happening.  Is your package 
online somewhere so we could try it on different machines?

Hi Farshad,


The error you get when compiling your vignette gives us a hint:

Error: processing vignette 'Rpvt.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
package or namespace load failed for 'ggpubr' in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):
 there is no package called 'data.table'

There is a long chain of dependencies here: if I write A -> B to say that package A lists package B as an Import (and therefore package B is loaded when package A is attached), we have


ggpubr -> rstatix -> car -> rio -> data.table.


I think the issue is that, since you list ggpubr in "Suggests", there's never a check that all its dependencies (and their dependencies etc) are installed, and therefore data.table was not installed before checking your package. (But I'm not sure exactly why ggpubr is installed but not all the dependencies.)


A solution would be to make your whole vignette fail "gracefully" when ggpubr isn't attached properly. Which is good practice anyway.

Hi Duncan,

I changed the version, recreated the package, and then tested it with the rhub::check_for_cran(). The function failed to create a summary for all the platform results together, however individual results are available in the following links.

The reason is that CRAN does not have an R-devel binary for
data.table, and because of this install.packages() decides not to
install it. Here is a workaround:

Thanks for the tips. It appears the error is indeed related to the
matchingMarkets package, but specifically an issue with rJava
configuration. Now I get the following (see
https://artifacts.r-hub.io/PAutilities_1.0.0.tar.gz-54a555386e924de6a53385479a1e199f/PAutilities.Rcheck/00check.log
):

VALIDATE...PREFS...MATCHES [*ignore this -- these are updates I printed
myself to pinpoint matchingMarkets as the culprit*]
WARNING: Initial Java 12 release has broken JNI support and does NOT work.
Use stable Java 11 (or watch for 12u if avaiable).
ERROR: Java exception occurred during rJava bootstrap - see stderr for Java
stack trace. Exception in thread "main"

* Is there a specification I can provide to get around this?

* Since the current CRAN version of my package depends on a recently
orphaned package, I am due to provide a new release by the 17th (per an
email from Prof. Brian Ripley). Is this a hard deadline, or can/should I
notify someone and/or request an extension? To complicate matters, I have a
publication coming out imminently, in which my package plays a central
role. So it's important that I avoid any lapse in its availability.

Hi,

I tried to solve the issue in multiple ways, but I keep getting an installation error when running R CMD check, although the package installs fine with R CMD INSTALL:

Error: package ?Matrix? required by ?NMF? could not be found

I clearly have the package Matrix installed and up-to-date.
I tried with/without Matrix in Depends, with/without importing it all in the NAMESPACE.
Do I need to have a statement like this in the NAMESPACE:

importClassesFrom(Matrix,mMatrix)


The class appears not to be exported.
Puzzled.

Thank you.

Matrix doesn't have the same versions as R:  it's a recommended package, 
not a base package.  It can be updated independently of R.  The current 
version on CRAN is 1.2-18, but the R-forge version is 1.3-0.  Neither 
one exports mMatrix.

So I can't use neither use the the class mMatrix form Matrix in my package, neither define an internal union class of ("Matrix", "matrix").
If I define a union class with a different name, then I have to import the class "Matrix" from Matrix or I get a check error.
But then I need to add Matrix as Depends (or I get an error, which makes sense).
The issue is that if I add Matrix as Depends I get the error that the package "Matrix" is not found, when checking if the package can be installed.
This error does not happen when installing with R CMD INSTALL.

I eventually managed to reproduce the error: as soon as I add ggplot2 in Imports I get the error.
A DESCRIPTION file with this breaks:

Depends:
  Matrix
Imports:
  ggplot2


I have Matrix 1.2.18 and ggplot2 3.3.0

Hello,

My package passed the R CMD check locally on my desktop with Windows
system, but not the winbuilder.   These are both done on R-4.0.0.

Does this happen to anyone else?

Here is the error:

This typically indicates Rd problems.
LaTeX errors found:

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.

I also have difficulty install R-devel on my desktop.  Here is the error

appreciated.

Different error report: but I?ve been getting an error reported from winbuilder, but no error/code failures revealed in the log?


Running examples in 'umx-Ex.R' failed
The error most likely occurred in:


?

[example code with no error showing in the code?]


Passes release checks fine on MacOS with R 4.0.0 So, hard to debug?

Best, tim

Hi all,

Thank you very much for all your great comments.
I followed the Gabor?s suggestion and didn?t receive any warnings or errors by testing the package on different platforms using rhub::check_for_cran(). 

Regards,
Farshad

The reason is that CRAN does not have an R-devel binary for
data.table, and because of this install.packages() decides not to
install it. Here is a workaround:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Dependencies NOTE lost with --as-cran
Message-ID: <CANBtttZMxR9K-Wer9CZ5cdJ9QMWBH2pALwAxQbOS7svdiYnsRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm not sure whether this is a packaging problem or a bug. Consider a
minimal package 'testpkg' with these files. The DESCRIPTION is
slightly modified from the output of utils::package.skeleton() to
create valid Title, Description, and License, and add a single package
to Imports.

---

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Package: testpkg
Type: Package
Title: What the Package Does (Short Line)
Version: 1.0
Date: 2020-05-22
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: Who to complain to <yourfault at somewhere.net>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line).
License: GPL-2
Imports: MASS

NAMESPACE [empty file]
---------

R/testfun.R
-----------
testfun <- function() {}

---

Note that NAMESPACE is present, but empty, so that testfun() is not
exported, and R CMD check doesn't complain about missing
documentation.

After building the package using R CMD build testpkg, I checked it twice with
R Under development (unstable) (2020-05-19 r78492) -- "Unsuffered Consequences"

1) R CMD check testpkg_1.0.tar.gz
...
* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ?MASS?
  All declared Imports should be used.
...

2) R CMD check --as-cran testpkg_1.0.tar.gz
...
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
[omitted text about New submission and placeholder content]
...
* checking dependencies in R code ... OK
...

My question is why the NOTE for "checking dependencies in R code" is
not present when using --as-cran? Possible clue: the NOTE also
disappears if testfun.R is removed.

Context: My package canprot_1.0.0 was recently published on CRAN. My
local checks with R CMD check --as-cran and checks on winbuilder both
showed "checking dependencies in R code ... OK", but now that the
package is on CRAN, a NOTE about "Namespace in Imports field not
imported from: ?knitr?" appears for a subset of check flavors
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_canprot.html).

I found a probable solution for canprot, which is to move knitr from
Imports to Suggests. However, I am surprised that the package
apparently needs to be checked *without* --as-cran to raise this NOTE.

This unanswered SO question seems related (specifically, the
'unfortunate note' comment of @vlad1490), but doesn't addresses the
particular behavior of --as-cran:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Guidelines on use of snow-style clusters in R
 packages?
Message-ID: <20200524172147.6cee696e@trisector>

Some of the packages I use make it possible to run some of the
computations in parallel. For example, sNPLS::cv_snpls calls
makeCluster() itself, makes sure that the package is loaded by workers,
exports the necessary variables and stops the cluster after it is
finished. On the other hand, multiway::parafac accepts arbitrary
cluster objects supplied by user, but requires the user to manually
preload the package on the workers. Both packages export and document
the internal functions intended to run on the workers.

Are there any guidelines for use of snow-style clusters in R packages? I
remember reading somewhere that accepting arbitrary cluster objects from
the user instead of makeCluster(detectCores()) is generally considered
a good idea (for multiple reasons ranging from giving the user more
control of CPU load to making it possible to run the code on a number
of networked machines that the package code knows nothing about), but I
couldn't find a reference for that in Writing R Extensions or parallel
package documentation.

What about preloading the package on the workers? Are there any
downsides to the package code unconditionally running clusterEvalQ(cl,
library(myself)) to avoid disappointing errors like "10 nodes produced
errors; first error: could not find function"?

Speaking of private functions intended to run by the package itself on
the worker nodes, should they be exported? I have prepared a test
package doing little more than the following:

R/fun.R:
private <- function(x) paste(x, Sys.getpid())
public <- function(cl, x) parallel::parLapply(cl, x, private)

NAMESPACE:
export(public)

The package passes R CMD check --as-cran without warnings or errors,
which seems to suggest that exporting worker functions is not required.

Hi folks,

Upon manual inspection of my package by CRAN maintainers I have been asked to put my references in the description field of the DESCRIPTION file. I have formatted all of my references as requested and put them there but get a note when checking the package (Malformed Description field: should contain one or more complete sentences.).  Does anyone have advice on how to place these here so I can clear this final hurdle to get the package back up on CRAN?

Thanks,

Sorry, ESP not working today. Note that this list may or may not include the reviewer who last checked your submission.

Perhaps re-read [1] and if you are still puzzled then consider pointing us to (or pasting into the body of the email) the DESCRIPTION file you are having difficulty with so we don't have to engage psychic powers.

Oh, and DON'T post HTML-formatted email on the R mailing lists.

Dear Alan

Without seeing your file it is hard to know but there are many examples 
on CRAN in the list of packages. It may be something simple like 
forgetting the full stop.

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for your response. My apologies for the lack of information or unintentional HTML formatting, I will take note for next time. This response (and the link you provided) did, however, remind me to take another look at the question and I now understand that I mis-interpreted what was being asked of me, and instead of references, I was being asked to present in-text citations. This has been resolved and I appreciate you taking the time to respond to my question.

Cheers,

Alan

Message-ID: <1386619.1590980194@apollo2.minshall.org>

hi.  i use emacs org-mode to write my literate (semi-, in my case)
code.  then, 'tangle' the results into package/R/foo.R, etc.

the tangling is driven by a makefile.  (my methodology is to make the
package source tree as a subdirectory of where my makefile sits; i
realize this is non-standard, and in many respects sub-optimal.)

the makefile then proceeds to R-CMD-build, R-CMD-check, and, assuming
those pass, Rscript-install the package.

i would like to *not* do the build/check/install if, in fact, nothing
has changed in the tangled files since the last time the
build/check/install ran.  the *dates* of the files (which is what make
typically looks at) *will* have changed.  but, i want to rely on the
contents, not on the dates.

i can imagine various hacks to accomplish this.  but, i thought that
someone on the list may have run into this before and have a
recommendation.

if so, i'm all ears!  thanks in advance.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Workflow for Javascript in package?
Message-ID: <cf1785e3-48fc-7277-44ac-b78ccce71f2f@gmail.com>

The rgl package includes a large amount of Javascript source to handle 
the display of output in browsers using rglwidget().  Currently this is 
mostly in one big file (inst/htmlwidgets/lib/rglClass/rglClass.src.js), 
but I'd like to make some improvements:

  - splitting it into separate files with related functions
  - automatically "compiling" it into a single file stripped of white 
space and comments, for faster loading.

Unfortunately, I have no other experience writing a Javascript library, 
so I really don't know what I'm doing.  Can anyone point me to other R 
packages containing htmlwidgets that do this "properly", or point to 
instructions for the standard workflow for Javascript library 
development outside of R that I could adapt?

Message-ID: <CAOO9MKUtBYnT1eMzYnZ6m-6i8Tqm6sYP23iXP4oC0gMMV2MG9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi package devel support,

I am trying to use R_MAKEVARS_USER to customize build, rather than
.R/Makevars. It is properly displayed from config CFLAGS but during
package install it doesn't seem to work.

In R-admin in "6.3.3 Customizing package compilation" there is:

> Note that these mechanisms do not work with packages which fail to pass settings down to sub-makes, perhaps reading etc/Makeconf in makefiles in subdirectories.

It seems that it applies to me. How should I debug that? to make this
env var respected? Note that my pkg has src/Makevars to handle openmp
switch nicely
Thank you

Duncan, I don?t think it is a particularly clever or efficient example, but my package exCon does some of what you describe.  Additional disclaimer: I?m not very good at serious Javascript, and find the scoping rules challenging.  Even so, exCon works pretty well on large data sets.  But you may be more interested in the infrastructure aspects.

https://cran.r-project.org/package=exCon <https://cran.r-project.org/package=exCon>

The gathering of separate .js files, minifying and deployment are handled in the main function exCon.R.  Javascript  and html files in inst/extdata.

Thanks!  I hadn't thought of using js::uglify_optimize().

I'd like to do the minification during package install rather than when 
used, and this appears to work in the R source code (at top level):

text <- 
readLines(system.file("htmlwidgets/lib/rglClass/rglClass.src.js", 
package = "rgl"))

if (requireNamespace("js", quietly = TRUE))
   text <- js::uglify_optimize(text)

writeLines(text, file.path(system.file("htmlwidgets/lib/rglClass", 
package = "rgl"), "rglClass.js"))

rm(text)

I'm not completely sure this is supported/allowed, though I don't see a 
CRAN rule to disallow it.

Now I can work on splitting up the big file, and doing a somewhat more 
complicated install of rglClass.js.

I don't know anything about the function of that environment variable, but 

a) system() invokes a child process so environment variable changes made using it will only affect the child process created by that system call.

b) The syntax you have used is shell-specific, so does not look portable.

Dear All,

I received warnings regarding a package:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_bujar.html

The warning still occurred after I changed export(bujar, gcv.enet) to export(bujar) in NAMESPACE. The function bujar was defined in the package, so I probably missed something in Sec 1.5.6 in Writing R Extensions.

Could somebody kindly advise how to address the warning?

Thanks,

Good morning,


I had a quick look at the source file on CRAN, and I don't see any evidence that you're using S4 classes...? Indeed, at the end of your function 'bujar', you are defining the class of the results using "class(x) <- value", which is an S3 idiom.


If indeed you're using S3 instead of S4, then the correct section of WRE is 1.5.2, and therefore you'll need to clean up your NAMESPACE.

Thank you Jeff for your comments.
Yet they does not seem to be related.
a) Environment variable is created inside `system` command, so env var
stays valid for the command. Which is confirmed in the first call that
properly shows CFLAGS.
b) Syntax passed checkbashisms so I expect no problems due to that.

Each call to system is independent, so it definitely is a problem.

Use Sys.setenv to make changes in environment variables that can be used within system calls.

Bash is not involved with the system call on Windows... so your syntax for setting an environment variable is not portable.

What is the problem exactly? variable name is hardcoded, and variable
value is hardcoded as well.
How it is possible for the second `system` call to deliver different
makevars file than the first one?
This is the problem in question.

Yes, I haven't thought about Windows. I should have mentioned I am on Linux.

This is a new check in R-devel. The NEWS say:

In your case, the NAMESPACE contains

but the package neither defines an S4 class "bujar" nor methods for the
S4 generic "show". You should remove these two lines from your NAMESPACE.

Adelchi,

I have a similar situation where I had made all of the typical academic references within the code and documentation for a small but important function my package uses. I was asked by the CRAN reviewers to add the author of that function to the DESCRIPTION Authors at R section. I added the following:
person("Terry", "Therneau", role = c("aut?))

If you copy code, you have to make sure that you can use it under the 
currrent license of your package, and you have to make sure to declare 
copright holders and authors. As the code is part of the package now, 
therese are of course now also copyright holders and authors of your 
package.

Thanks for this information, Mark.

Given the phrase "small but important function my package uses", it seems 
that you included in your package some code, reproducing it verbatim. 
Do I understand correctly?
In my case, the code which I am actually using is the R porting of  code
originally written in another language, namely Matlab.

Best wishes,

Adelchi

The point in question does not refer to copying code, but to code translation.
Does this make any difference? 
This was the question which I raised.

The phrase "As the code is part of the package now," does not seem to apply in this case,
since the code is actually not there.

Also, if the authors of the original code (in Matlab) must be included in the Authors at R 
block of the DESCRIPTION file, should they be labelled as "aut", "cbt", or what?

Apart from the specific instance  which my earlier question was referring to,
the view "As the code is part of the package now, therese are of course now also copyright 
holders and authors of your package" opens another question, closely related but different,
as it refers to code which is included, not translated. 
The above-quoted sentence appears to say that anyone who has written any
portion of code is an author of the package. In this view, who must be labelled "cbt" then?

Best regards

Adelchi

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] S4 methods
Message-ID: <CAKtnMVzW-9jSrG3JfFWvc9mNPgfj8WOWypD-6EtiS+arGXD-ag@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members

I just finished some minor updates to an R package (sizeMat) I've had on
CRAN (haven't had to update in a month). My package passes Check on my
local machine, but it just bounced back from CRAN with the message

Warning: S4 exports specified in 'NAMESPACE' but not defined in package
'sizeMat'

I use roxygen2 to build my package NAMESPACE and don't have any S4 exports
that I'm aware of.

Perhaps this might be related to changes in R version 4.0.0?
How could I fix this problem?

Thanks.

This is a new check in R-devel. The NEWS say:

> R CMD check etc now warn when a package exports non-existing S4 classes or methods, also in case of no "methods" presence

In your case, the NAMESPACE contains

> exportClasses(classify)

> exportClasses(gonad_mature)

> exportClasses(morphMat)

but your package does not define these S4 classes.

You seem to instruct roxygen2 to create these invalid directives using
@exportClass tags manually instead of just @export. Simply remove these
wrong @exportClass tags from your source files and regenerate your
NAMESPACE.

Best regards,

You export these S4 classes from your package:
https://github.com/cran/sizeMat/blob/c4d257a9108cde3ddb6e8eb2072cd567ae85b5c8/NAMESPACE#L13-L15

But these are not actually S4 classes, AFAICT. Remove the
`@exportClass` tags here:

To present a contrary view...

To me the commentary so far doesn't seem right -- if I were writing an academic paper (I personally think this is a good analogy for many R packages) and elaborating on the ideas of someone else, I would cite their work but I would not add them as an author to my paper. I would not expect the authors of cited work to agree with or take responsibility for my work, which is what authorship (in the publication domain) implies. In the current case there is no reason to think that the author of matlab code would be informed about or willing to vouch for the R implementation. Minimally, in an academic setting I would (be required to) ask whether the individual wished to be an author. 

Conversely, if an author were to have made a substantive contribution to my package, and objected to the content of the package with their name on it, I would feel obliged to respect their wishes and, e.g., withdraw or, if permitted by licensing, revise or re-publish the paper / package without the author. This makes me think carefully about who actually contributed to the package, rather than merely whose prior work my package builds upon.

Of course it is necessary to obey licensing terms of the prior work, and important to acknowledge, above and beyond the specific licensing terms, the contributions individuals make.

    This was the question which I raised.

    The phrase "As the code is part of the package now," does not seem to apply in this case,
    since the code is actually not there.

    Also, if the authors of the original code (in Matlab) must be included in the Authors at R 
    block of the DESCRIPTION file, should they be labelled as "aut", "cbt", or what?

    Apart from the specific instance  which my earlier question was referring to,
    the view "As the code is part of the package now, therese are of course now also copyright 
    holders and authors of your package" opens another question, closely related but different,
    as it refers to code which is included, not translated. 
    The above-quoted sentence appears to say that anyone who has written any
    portion of code is an author of the package. In this view, who must be labelled "cbt" then?

    Best regards

    Adelchi

I had similar thoughts initially, but this area is governed by copyright, not academic authorship conventions. So 

(a) There is no real parallel to "citation rights" when it comes to software. If you use someone else's code, then it is very hard to avoid derived-works rules applying.

(b) Copyright transfers to translated works. This is pretty obvious when it comes to books, maybe less obvious for computer code, but it certainly wouldn't make sense if translation to machine language rendered copyright inapplicable. You cannot copyright ideas only their expression, but the question was explicitly about translation from Matlab to R.

So, I think the safe way is to include the original authors in the author list (and check their license carefully).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] win-builder failing without informative message
Message-ID: <CAG5xu56mfBg1diGKFDK2pcCxe2vKi3X1_MHHhUbd3D6surhi1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello List!

I am prepping gtsummary for a new release, but I am running into a problem
with the CRAN win-builder.

The package is passing checks on my local Windows machine, another local
Windows machine, on a GitHub Actions Windows machine (
https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary/runs/729569705?check_suite_focus=true).
However I am getting this error on win-builder in `00check.log`:

Check process probably crashed or hung up for 20 minutes ... killed
Most likely this happened in the example checks (?),
if not, ignore the following last lines of example output:

======== End of example output (where/before crash/hang up occured ?) ========

link to win-builder results https://win-builder.r-project.org/SFSFeP44df58/

Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this error?  The build is also passing on
macOS and Ubuntu GitHub Actions checks.

Thank you!
Daniel

  In my opinion, if you've tested on multiple Windows system that
you've done your due diligence and shouldn't worry too much about
win-builder hiccups ...

Seems like your tests did not finish:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/SFSFeP44df58/examples_and_tests/tests_x64/testthat.Rout

Either they take too long, or they froze. You can use a different
testthat reporter, to see which one is stuck, e.g. like this:
https://github.com/cran/desc/blob/3e52b4923c7852bc00fbc94887c42657ffc67283/tests/testthat.R#L4

Indeed. I would definitely not list the original Matlab authors as
'aut', but just as 'ctb' (= contributor).

e.g., for the 'robustbase' package, I have, among authors at R

      , person("Peter", "Rousseeuw", role="ctb", comment = "Qn and Sn")

Personally, I'd always use a  comment = "..."  tag mentioning
*what* the contributor (or "co-author") has contributed to.

Best,
Martin

Adelchi,

Actually, the person recognized wrote the original code for the algorithm and he has had other contributors over time that have made several improvements. The code I have is not verbatim from his package as it has been adapted for our purposes, but he is still the originator of the approach and I am certain he and others would recognize the code as being clearly deriviative. I have retained some of the same function names or near derivatives of those names. My coding style is different but that has not changed the basic logic.

With regard to licensing, we both use MIT, which I strongly prefer. The GPL-2 and GPL-3 licenses are apparently sufficiently ambiguous in the legal community that some companies avoid them.

This is a mailing list of the R project. R is a GNU Project. R is licensed
under the GPL, version two or later. That has not stopped large corporations
from using R, adopting R, or starting or acquiring R related businesses.

If you have a strong urge to spread FUD about the GPL and R, could you have the
modicum of etiquette to not do it on a mailing list of the R Project?

Thanks to all people that contributed  to this discussion,
which turned out to be interesting, definitely not something which I expected at the beginning.

To avoid verbosity, I restrict myself to two more points.

(1) In case one adopts the indication that all the authors of a portion of code (irrespective of the extension, even in other languages)  are "of course now also copyright holders and authors", how should this be translated  in the nomenclature of Writing R Extensions (Section 1.1.1 The DESCRIPTION file)?  In this view, "ctb" is the more appropriate role, I believe. The "aut" label is not the right option. Otherwise, dozens on CRAN packages where "ctb" is extensively used should be amended.

(2) Having read pertaining portions of manuals and pondered messages, I have come to the conclusion that the terminology set up in the above-quoted paragraph of "Writing R Extensions" is not always ideal. This issue would take a long time and space, so I only indicate one point: the role ?"cre"? (creator) for the package maintainer. There are many cases where this description does not fit. For instance, I have seen packages where an author has designed the package, written the entire code and documentation alone, maintained the package for some years, and then passed on the mere maintenance to somebody else; definitely, I would not describe the second person as the "creator".

In  general, "check the license" is a very sensible indication. In the specific case, the Matlab code comes with no licence indication - nothing.

I have now submitted mnormt_2.0.0.tar.gz to CRAN, with a comment/query about this issue.  Let us see what "The CRAN" says. In case you want see the conclusion, the outcome should appear at https://cran.r-project.org/package=mnormt in a few days.

 ????? Can Dr. Sharp kindly provide a credible reference, discussing the 
alleged ambiguities in GPL-2 and GPL-3 that convince some companies to 
avoid them?


 ????? I like Wikimedia Foundation projects like Wikipedia, where almost 
anyone can change almost anything, and what stays tends to be written 
from a neutral point of view, citing credible sources.? I get several 
emails a day notifying me of changes in articles I'm "watching".? FUD, 
vandalism, etc., are generally reverted fairly quickly or moved to the 
"Talk" page associated with each article, where the world is invited to 
provide credible source(s).

For instance, I have seen packages where an author has designed the package, written the entire code and documentation alone, maintained the package for some years, and then passed on the mere maintenance to somebody else; definitely, I would not describe the second person as the "creator".

I think the issue was that those roles are not invented by R, they are 
standard MARC roles (reference listed in the ?person help page), and the 
full list contains nothing that is particularly close to the role of 
maintainer.

Creator [cre] is defined as "A person or organization responsible for 
the intellectual or artistic content of a resource".  The common English 
use of the word creator would match that with "originally responsible", 
whereas a maintainer is "currently responsible", so it's not completely 
off-base.

Maybe R shouldn't have tried to use MARC roles, or should have invented 
an additional one.  It's a bit late for that now, though.

Simply:

** running tests for arch 'i386' ... [14m] OK

And the CRAN threshold for the whole package is 10 min. So only the 
tests for two architectures already take ~ 30 min here. which is too 
much for CRAN.

Best,

 ????? I'm not an attorney, but it's my understanding that "no license 
indication" is a legal minefield:? You can be sued for copyright 
infringement, even with anything that "comes with no license indicate - 
nothing."? For horror stories in that regard, see the Wikipedia article 
on Lawrence Lessig's "Free Culture (book) 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_(book)]:? Hollywood has lots 
of money for SLAPP lawsuits, and they've used it to stifle competition.


 ????? To me, this is in blatant violation of the Copyright Clause of 
the US Constitution, which says, "[the United States Congress shall have 
power] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing 
for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their 
respective Writings and Discoveries."[1]? However, as Lessig documented, 
the US Supreme Court disagreed.


QUESTION:? How much money have people on this list received for what 
they've written?? I've received not one penny for any technical article 
I've written or for software contributed to CRAN.


 ????? Spencer

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Including fonts in an rmarkdown vignette
Message-ID: <CAARY7kjqC_7tuMoab5KddJ_8aCJ8zD84MdYzpR+z36yv5RtM9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to build a rmarkdown vignette with my own choice of fonts ? I'm
pernickety about look and feel.

R CMD check will rebuild vignettes in the vignettes/ directory, and if
relevant fonts aren't on the build machine, it'll give a warning.

Here are the options I can think of:
* build vignettes on my machine and put them in inst/doc. Don't mention the
specific fonts in the Rmd file in vignettes/. So the file built by "R CMD
check" won't look quite like the pre-built version.  This might work, but
it seems against open source principle.
* put font files in vignettes/ and refer to them in the rmarkdown file. I'm
not sure how to do this.
* limit myself to the fonts preinstalled on win-builder or CRAN machines.
I'm not sure what these are

Has anyone got any advice or examples?

Cheers,
David

Ditto. What's even more annoying is when people clearly use one's package
in their published work and do not cite it, but that is for a different
thread.

I have an RMarkdown vignette in a package that uses Rcpp and depends on BH.
I added BH to the Suggests list. It is still generating warnings about BH.
What is the correct way to handle this?

Thanks.

If a package is listed in Suggests, it should still work (possibly with 
diminished capabilities) when that package is not present.  So at the 
start of your vignette you could have something like

if (!require("BH")) {
   message("This vignette needs BH; since it is not installed, code will 
not be executed.")

   # Set default for chunk option "exec" to FALSE in all code chunks.
}

 ????? Might that be a copyright violation or just intellectual laziness 
or in some cases dishonesty but short of a level that could lead to some 
disciplinary action in a university or research organization?

For academics, aren't those citations the currency in which they are 
supposed to be paid (at least for R packages)?

Spencer,

I apologize for my obvious (in hindsight) error in bringing up the topic. I will bring up one example, because of your request. Google has listed GPL-1, 2, and 3 as one of several licenses that are restricted and cannot be used by a Google product delivered to outside customers. This include downloadable client software and software such as insdie the Google Search Appliance. This includes having scripts that load packages dynamically as with ?library()? and ?require()?. Please see https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/licenses/#restricted for their wording. 

I am not defending their position and disagree with it. However, it is their position based on what I think is a conservative or overly cautious legal interpretation. I am not a lawyer, however, so my opinions are of no import.

IANAL, but the GPL family of licenses is VIRAL copy left so it infects
anything it touched, which is why many shy away and prefer something like
the Mozilla Public License 2 (MPL) as a compromise between viral copyleft
and the permissive MIT/ISC/BSD2.

To a good first approximations, "nobody" on this list is a lawyer.

We are all statisticians, or analysts, or quantitatively-minded coders. Which
means it is the wrong list to have this discussion. Please take it elsewhere.

As for the argument contained in that email of yours, I think it boils down to

 - Company X quotes what you think are good reasons not use license Y.

 - We all read and interpret as we want to. But now you go on to conclude "So
   I should not use license Y."

 - And you then appear to extrapolate to "Nobody should use Y."

It simply does not work that way.  Not from 1) to 2), and (most certainly)
not from 2) to 3). Remember what you ignore from my last email: this is a
list of a GPL (>= 2) licensed project.

But that whole discussion had been had a million times already in a million
places.  This is not one of them.

A few of use came together here to offer help on packaging for R and CRAN, to
move traffic of R-devel (as packaging is generally "not R development", and
to help the CRAN maintainers by taking some load of their inboxes. I am one
of three founders of the list, and continue to help by 'filtering' first
posters. And I have *zero appetite* for this place to become your license
discussion hotspot. Please take it elsewhere, maybe even to a lawyer if you
want real advice.

Thank you, Dirk

"Viral" is has connotations that reflect the biases of the person using the term. A less loaded perspective is that some people don't want you to take their contributions out of circulation by using it as the foundation of your proprietary work. If you want to close it up, build from scratch or find some other code that isn't GPL.

Describing it as "viral" makes it sound as if they were trying to steal something you did instead of protecting their code from being stolen. Please refrain from being inflammatory.

Apologies; my intent was not to disparage, but that is the term is used in
the industry and in venues which discuss FLOSS because it reflects that the
addition of one component with that kind of copyleft license causes the
entire project to need that particular copyleft license. If there is a term
which reflects that mechanism from a discipline other than biology,
please let me know.

Thanks,

Avi

The obvious answer is simply to refer to GPL. It isn't necessary to propagate a derogatory point of view by finding another word for an incorrect idea.  Try re-reading my previous words without trying to hold on to a flawed interpretation.

I respectfully submit that the mechanism is accurately described as ?viral?
albeit the connotations may be uncomfortable. I will refrain from
commenting further in this thread. Happy to continue with you off-list if
you wish.

Thank you,

Aavi

I think that "copyleft" is the term you are looking for. The Wikipedia

Hi,

I've recently seen an example of a package that provides its own fonts for a vignette. See links in https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/06/03/vignettes/#pretty-vignettes 


In that same post I link to a workaround I saw on this list https://www.mail-archive.com/r-package-devel at r-project.org/msg02921.html for changing the vignette format based on the versions of dependencies. Maybe something similar is possible for fonts (I have no idea).

Ma?lle.

Hi,

I'd like to build a rmarkdown vignette with my own choice of fonts ? I'm
pernickety about look and feel.

R CMD check will rebuild vignettes in the vignettes/ directory, and if
relevant fonts aren't on the build machine, it'll give a warning.

Here are the options I can think of:
* build vignettes on my machine and put them in inst/doc. Don't mention the
specific fonts in the Rmd file in vignettes/. So the file built by "R CMD
check" won't look quite like the pre-built version.? This might work, but
it seems against open source principle.
* put font files in vignettes/ and refer to them in the rmarkdown file. I'm
not sure how to do this.
* limit myself to the fonts preinstalled on win-builder or CRAN machines.
I'm not sure what these are

Has anyone got any advice or examples?

Cheers,
David

If you are ok to use one of the fonts available on google font, you could use package gfonts (in Suggests):
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gfonts/vignettes/gfonts.html <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gfonts/vignettes/gfonts.html>

As it will be ? inline ?, your document size could inflate (I guess it could be an issue with CRAN) - if only one font, size should be ok.

Otherwise, you also could add a css chunk to import the font from a public server - if no internet connexion, nothing will break.

Thank you for these suggestions. Google fonts sounds like quite an easy
approach.

 [External] Guidelines on use of snow-style clusters in R packages?
In-Reply-To: <20200524172147.6cee696e@trisector>
References: <20200524172147.6cee696e@trisector>
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.21.2006030841020.3474@luke-Latitude-7480>

The basic principle I would follow is to make sure your code only goes
parallel with explicit permission from the end user. One way to do
that is accept a cluster from the caller; another is to create
and shut down your won cluster if a global option is set (via options()
or a mechanism of your own).

If you create and shut down your own cluster you can do pretty much
what you like. If you use one passed to you it would be best to leave
it in the state you found it at least as far as the search path and
global environment are concerned. So use foo::bar instead of library().

User can also set a default cluster. You can use getDefaultCluster to
retrieve it; this returns NULL if no default cluster is set.  You
could assume that if one is set you are allowed to use it, but it
might still be a good idea to look for explicit permission via an
option or an argument. I would again try to leave the cluster used
this way in as clean a state as you can.

Best,

luke

Hello,

I just submitted an update of my package to CRAN and it does not pass
incoming checks. While local checks, win-builder and GitHub CI
(Mac/Win/Linux) all pass, I get the Note you see below for the checks during
submission process. I have no idea why this happens and see this message for
the first time. I *assume* it's a temporary issue / false positive, but want
to be sure before I reply to the CRAN team.

Can anyone help how I can address this issue, or if it indeed might be a
false positive?

Thanks and best wishes
Daniel

What package? A package / repo name would have helped here. Did I miss it?

One of my golden rules for debugging is the old "doctor, doctor, I hurt when
I do this" joke. There is no shame in disabling a test that bites: "if it
hurts, don't do it". The next step then is is to reproduce locally---which is
still an uphill battle because CRAN, resource contrained as they are, have
not provided their setups in ways that are easily reproducible by us mortals.

Hi Dirk,

the package in question is "insight"
(https://cran.r-project.org/package=insight). Since a few days, the test for
the panelr-package fails, because panelr itself fails on many systems
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_panelr.html). I *think*
this is due to an update of dpylr that causes trouble with panelr, because
both insight and panelr checks were OK the last weeks.

Now win-builder checks for insight are OK, local checks (Win) are OK and
GitHub CI is ok (https://github.com/easystats/insight). 

If you need, I uploaded the source version of insight here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sZ2n3utc27U0DrcFlAsH6NQpKMssIiEg/view?usp=s
haring

The GitHub version only differs in the package version number in the
DESCRIPTION file (which is 0.8.4.1 on GitHub and will be updated once the
update is accepted on CRAN).

I can't imagine any special revisions that might lead to that NOTE in the
incoming checks on Linux.

Hope that helps...

Best
Daniel

What package? A package / repo name would have helped here. Did I miss it?

One of my golden rules for debugging is the old "doctor, doctor, I hurt when
I do this" joke. There is no shame in disabling a test that bites: "if it
hurts, don't do it". The next step then is is to reproduce locally---which
is
still an uphill battle because CRAN, resource contrained as they are, have
not provided their setups in ways that are easily reproducible by us
mortals.

You could possibly confirm that hypothesis by working in a 'clean' test
environment -- Docker containers are an option -- via a simple comparison of
installing identical versions of all packages apart from the suspected one.

Hi Dirk,

I'm not sure I got what you mean? Locally, I used RStudio with R4.0 to check
the package. The checks I mentioned below were the official CRAN check
pages. I have now tried to run the checks on rhub, however, I'm not sure how
to access the logs:

https://builder.r-hub.io/status/insight_0.8.5.tar.gz-6f814b95949368dcdd83d8f

Dear all,

I have submitted a patch release (1.6.0) of my package metan
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metan/) to fix an additional issue
and implement some improvements. All local checks had no errors or warnings,
but after the submission process, I received the following message.

Dear maintainer,

package metan_1.6.1.tar.gz has been auto-processed.

The auto-check found additional issues for the *last* version released on

CRAN incoming checks do not test for these additional issues and you will
need an appropriately instrumented build of R to reproduce these.

Hence please reply-all and explain: Have these been fixed?

Hi Dirk,

ok, I think I got what you meant. The error for insight-checks came from
panelr, which is a suggested package. I contacted the maintainer, who said
that he won't be able to fix panelr in time, so I removed the test for the
panelr-package from insight. So, for this submission, no matter what
problems the panelr-package has, this should not be related to the NOTE I
get from the CRAN checks during submission.

Best
Daniel

Message-ID: <CA+fi=+=O4BKC=tCE0HJ+eCVuYOD95q9zt7sHGyjsjcAznTH=4g@mail.gmail.com>

I notice the CRAN pdf didn't justify correctly long texts inside \code{}
even having "," or spaces irrespective of the status of the argument
(oneliner or multiliner)
in source (.R / .Rd)
https://imgur.com/RvjzMDh

I noticed also that it is not a problem in a pkgdown doc:
https://imgur.com/LsmuPE1

I ended up splitting the \code{} into several \codes{} with
file.R with \code{...} in one line as input.
example
from:
  \code{unique(c(dfMarkPos$markName,dfCenMarks$markName) ) }
to:
  \code{unique(c(dfMarkPos$markName,} \code{dfCenMarks$markName) ) }
https://imgur.com/Pwhfu0j

I used roxygen formatted .R, but could work with .Rd
after .R script (below) I produced .Rd with devtools:document(), then,
pdf:  devtools::build_manual(path=getwd())

gblines<-readLines(file)
for (i in 1:length(gblines) ) {
  if(grepl("^#\'",gblines[i]) & grepl("\\code",gblines[i] ) ) {
    co <- regmatches(gblines[i], gregexpr('code\\{.*?\\}', gblines[i],
perl=T) )
    if(length(co[[1]])>0){
      co2 <- strsplit(co[[1]],",")
      withCode <-    unlist(lapply(co2, function(x) unlist(regmatches(x,
gregexpr('code\\{.*', x, perl=T) ) ) ) )
      notWithCode <- (lapply(co2, function(x) unlist(regmatches(x,
gregexpr('^(?:(?!code\\{.*).)*$', x, perl=T) ) ) ) )
      names(notWithCode)<-1:length(notWithCode)
      names(withCode)<-1:length(withCode)
      l_tmp <- c(withCode, notWithCode)
      keys = unique(names(l_tmp))
      l = sapply(keys, function(name) {unlist(l_tmp[grep(name,
names(l_tmp))])}, simplify = F)
      repwith<-list(unlist(lapply(l, function(x) paste(x, collapse=",}
\\code{"))
                           ) )
      regmatches(gblines[i], gregexpr('code\\{.*?\\}', gblines[i], perl=T)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] using devtools::install_github() when curl is a
 dependency
Message-ID: <850EDE57-2121-4DB7-BA27-3D4489CA047F@uni-due.de>

Dear colleagues,

using devtools::install_github() is suggested frequently to install the development version of a package from GitHub.

But there is a nasty scenario on Windows when the package to be installed from GitHub has curl as a dependency and if a new version of curl or backports is available. The user will be prompted whether the outdated packages shall be updated. Users will usually confirm to update all CRAN packages. But after downloading the binaries, the installation will fail with a message that curl cannot be removed.

My understanding of the issue is as follows: devtools has curl as a dependency. When calling devtools::install_github() or remotes::install_github(), the curl package is attached. This implies loading the curl DLL. The dll file is then non-writable, if my analysis is correct. If (a) the package to be installed from GitHub has curl as a dependency and if (b) the curl version present on the users? system needs to be updated and if (c) the user agrees to perform the update, the binary is downloaded successfully, but installing the newer version of curl will fail, because loading the curl DLL has been triggered when attaching devtools and the DLL file is write-protected.

This is the line that has caused my headaches:
devtools::install_github(?PolMine/cwbtools?, ref = ?dev?)
The cwbtools package has curl as a dependency, and it was curl v4.2 that was installed, the newest version is v4.3.

First, I am interested whether you think my analysis is correct. Second, I would appreciate your advice on good practice to deal with this scenario!

My idea so far is to amend the README file, telling users (a) to reject updating dependencies if  curl is to be updated or alternatively (b) to recommend the snippet ` devtools::install_github(?PolMine/cwbtools?, ref = ?dev?, upgrade = ?never?)` for GithHub-installations and a manual update of dependencies.

I tend to think this is not an uncommon issue for Windows users. Something like this may occur whenever a package is to be installed from GitHub that has common dependency with devtools that needs to be updated. The error message is very hard to understand for ?human? users and it is hard to find the solution for ?human? users. Recommendations welcome!

Kind regards
Andreas

Have you tried setting

R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS=TRUE

I have feeling that is a warning promoted to an error by the remotes package. Similarly have you tried updating the curl package manually with install.packages after loading it in an R session? 

Best,

Greg.

Hi, you can use the remotes package (that devtools itself uses under
the hood), and set the R_REMOTES_STANDALONE="true" environment
variable. Then remotes will not use any packages to perform the
downloads and the installations. See more here:
https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#standalone-mode

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] using devtools::install_github() when curl is a

Dear Gabor, 

the standalone mode is the perfect fix for my issue and I will adapted the recommended GitHub installation mechanism in the README of my cwbtools package accordingly. Like this:

Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_STANDALONE="true")
remotes::install_github("PolMine/cwbtools", ref = "dev")
 
Thanks so much for your swift help! 

A big thanks also to Greg for the very helpful idea.

Kind regards
Andreas

    Hi, you can use the remotes package (that devtools itself uses under
    the hood), and set the R_REMOTES_STANDALONE="true" environment
    variable. Then remotes will not use any packages to perform the
    downloads and the installations. See more here:
    https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#standalone-mode

This implies loading the curl DLL. The dll file is then non-writable, if my analysis is correct. If (a) the package to be installed from GitHub has curl as a dependency and if (b) the curl version present on the users? system needs to be updated and if (c) the user agrees to perform the update, the binary is downloaded successfully, but installing the newer version of curl will fail, because loading the curl DLL has been triggered when attaching devtools and the DLL file is write-protected.

Hello,

I would like to point out that I (and others in various forums) find that
the CRAN check with the note :


*checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTEMaintainer*

Triggers an email saying


1) *package nanny_0.1.7.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks
automatically*

2) *Please fix all problems and resubmit a fixed version via the webform*


While apparently nothing should be done, at least according to some forum
post
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23829978/checking-cran-incoming-feasibility-note-maintainer

It would be nice to avoid this from the test side or the email side. It is
pretty confusing for developers who think that they have to act.


Best wishes.

Not true, it also says

Flavor: r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: running examples for arch 'x64', Result: NOTE
   Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s
                             user system elapsed

Please reduce each example to less than 5 sec.

Hi, Uwe et al.:


 ????? What's the preferred way to eliminate tests on CRAN that the 
maintainer still wants to run on other platforms?


 ????? For several years, I've been using "if(!fda::CRAN()){...}". I've 
been told that I should NOT do that, but it has worked for me, and I 
haven't found anything better.? I've recently seen 
"testthat::skip_on_cran(...)", but I have yet to understand enough of 
how it works to actually use it.


 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

Nor do I how they can find out, as our idea is that CRAN cannot be 
special cased.
If you want to run additional tests, you can execute them if some env 
var is set that you define on machines where you want to run the 
additional tests.

That is exactly how testthat::skip_on_cran() works. If you set
`NOT_CRAN="true"` then the test runs. And to make it more helpful,
Travis, GitHub Actions, etc. automatically set it.

Hi Spencer,

the NOTE you posted in your email was related to examples, so you probably don't need to remove tests. You can wrap part of the examples in \dontrun{} to reduce check time for examples.

As for tests, there are several ways of skipping (long-running) tests on CRAN. If you're using testthat, you typically have code chunks like this in your test-files:

  test_that("my_function", {
    expect_false(...)
    expect_equal(...)
  })

Just insert a "testthat::skip_on_cran()" as first line in that code-chunk:

  test_that("my_function", {
    skip_on_cran()
    expect_false(...)
    expect_equal(...)
  })

This will skip this particular test.

Another way if you want to run a complete test-file only locally depends on versioning. I always use 4 decimals as version numbers for my packages in development, e.g. package_0.1.2.3, and on CRAN, only three decimals: package_0.1.3 (this related to the package version you define in the DESCRIPTION file). If you follow this rules, you can set a global environment variable in the main test file, when you use "testthat", you should insert following code (change package name accordingly) in "testthat.R":

if (length(strsplit(packageDescription("my_package")$Version, "\\.")[[1]]) > 3) {
  Sys.setenv("RunAllPkgTests" = "yes")
} else {
  Sys.setenv("RunAllPkgTests" = "no")
}

For versions on CRAN (i.e. version number like 0.1.0), the environment variable "RunAllPkgTests" is "no", for your local package with version number like 0.1.0.1 this would be "yes". Then you wrap your complete test file into an if-statement:

.runThisTest <- Sys.getenv("RunAllinsightTests") == "yes"

if (.runThisTest) {
  # ... all my tests here
}

Here's a practical example:
https://github.com/easystats/insight/blob/master/tests/testthat.R
https://github.com/easystats/insight/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-bigglm.R

And for skip_on_cran() / skip_on_travis:
https://github.com/easystats/insight/blob/cddc6df6783aae859f2b707dd5a938493bff3aaa/tests/testthat/test-spatial.R#L141

Hope this helps!

Best
Daniel

Betreff: Re: [R-pkg-devel] email misleading: checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE Maintainer

Hi, Uwe et al.:


       What's the preferred way to eliminate tests on CRAN that the 
maintainer still wants to run on other platforms?


       For several years, I've been using "if(!fda::CRAN()){...}". I've 
been told that I should NOT do that, but it has worked for me, and I 
haven't found anything better.  I've recently seen 
"testthat::skip_on_cran(...)", but I have yet to understand enough of 
how it works to actually use it.


       Thanks,
       Spencer Graves

The built-in way is to put those tests in a separate directory, and 
specify that directory when you run R CMD check.  For example, rgl has 
directory "inst/slowTests", and I use these options to R CMD check:

--test-dir=inst/slowTests

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Forward function call
Message-ID: <c1c8f1ca-40d5-e19e-20f2-14e8034d2fce@umu.se>

Hello,

the function 'coxreg' in my package 'eha' is often just a wrapper for 
'coxph' in survival, so I have code like

     if (cox.ph){
         Call <- match.call()
         Call[[1]] <- as.name("coxph")
         fit <- eval.parent(Call)
         return(fit)
     }

which works since eha depends on survival. Now I am thinking of changing 
Depends to Imports, and I would like to change the code to

     if (cox.ph){
         Call <- match.call()
         Call[[1]] <- as.name("survival::coxph")
         fit <- eval.parent(Call)
         return(fit)
     }

but this doesn't work, because the function name is turned into
`survival::coxph` (with the backticks) and the evaluation fails.

How can I solve this?

Thanks, G,

You will first need to convert the function call to an expression, then you
can modify the expression as appropriate.

Here's a somewhat contrived minimal example:

> f <- function(z, ...) match.call()
> aaa = f(a=1,2,3)
> str(aaa)
 language f(z = 2, a = 1, 3)
> aaa <- as.expression(aaa)
> str(aaa)
  expression(f(z = 2, a = 1, 3))
> aaa[[1]][[1]] <- expression(base::c)[[1]]
> str(aaa)
  expression(base::c(z = 2, a = 1, 3))
> eval(aaa)
z a
2 1 3

 I think quote(survival::coxph) will work in place of as.name() ?

Thanks for the responses!

I found the suggestion

Call[[1]] <- quote(survival::coxph)

easiest to implement. And it works.

and it is what we use in R's own R source code in several
places (and that's where/how I assume it also came to  Ben
Bolker, lme4, etc) :

"pkg::fun" cannot be a name because it is a function call already
`::`(pkg, fun).

Thanks for this advice! I guess that clusterExport() is also out of
question in package code, then.

I have found out that R Internals documents serialize() to use a very
efficient representation for package environments (a pseudo-SEXPTYPE
followed by the name). Does it mean that it is a good idea to pass
unexported private worker functions to parLapply(cl, X, fun), since the
package environment is not sent over network?

Hello,

I noticed a strange error pop up for R-devel (2020-06-12 r78687) check on travis: https://travis-ci.org/github/grunwaldlab/poppr/jobs/697831376#L4653-L4654

* checking Rd cross-references ... WARNING
Non-file package-anchored link(s) in documentation object 'aboot.Rd':
  ?[ape:phylo]{ape::phylo()}?

I looked at the Cross-reference section of WRE, but I couldn't find any mention of non-file package-anchored links being a problem: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Cross_002dreferences

Is this a new policy?

All the best,
Zhian

This is probably a new test of the long-time requirement that links 
should be to filenames, not aliases, when they go to other packages. 
WRE says

"There are two other forms of optional argument specified as 
\link[pkg]{foo} and \link[pkg:bar]{foo} to link to the package pkg, to 
files foo.html and bar.html respectively."

The problem is that `phylo` is documented in the read.tree.Rd file in 
ape, so your link needs to be

  \link[ape:read.tree]{ape::phylo()}

I wish I had fixed this inconsistency years ago when I rewrote the Rd 
code, but I didn't.  It would have been painful at the time (there were 
already thousands of CRAN packages, and lots would have needed fixing), 
but would be much worse now.

Another design flaw that I didn't fix is that you can have an Rd with 
\name{foo} and no \alias{foo}, and searching ?foo won't find it.  In 
that case I failed to convince other R core members that it would have 
been a good change.

Zhian, it seems that some of the problematic links are created by
roxygen2. You can fix these using this PR:
https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/pull/1109
You can install this branch with
remotes::install_github("r-lib/roxygen2 at fix/link-to-file")

To fix the remaining ones, you need to modify your \link[]{} macros or
switch them to roxygen [pkg::fun()] links.

I really like how the help system resolves links based on _topics_,
even for cross-package links. So I admit that I did not follow this
requirement too closely. It is better to link to topics instead of
files, because then links are independent of how the manual is
organized into files. E.g. it is not uncommon to split up a help file
that used to document multiple functions, into several files, because
the functions gain more functionality, or need more examples, etc. and
the manual page is getting less focused and harder to follow. It is
perfectly natural that the manual of a package is evolving together
with the code.

With enforcing this requirement, such documentation changes are
considered as breaking changes. If we need to link to files, then what
we get is more broken links, and more forced package updates, just to
fix the broken links. In particular, if a package moves a help topic
to another help file in a new release, then other packages linking to
this topic have to update their links, and if these happened to be
installed together with the old version of the linked package, they'll
have a broken link. This is a pity, because finding the right help
files is easy to automate, and in fact the help system already
supports it perfectly well.

As far as I can tell the only alternative of linking to the file is
using an unqualified link, i.e. not specifying the target package at
all. The help system can do the lookup at render time, and this is
usually OK, but for a non-trivial number of cases it is not, because
the resolution of the link depends on what packages are currently
loaded. If the right package is not loaded, then the link will
potentially go to the wrong help file, which is absurd. Or, if
multiple packages have the required topic, the user is presented with
a menu, which is also confusing. OTOH the manual authors know
perfectly well which package they want to link to, they just can't
specify it any more...

I am probably missing something, but what do we gain from linking to
files, instead of topics? Especially that linking to topics already
works perfectly well?
