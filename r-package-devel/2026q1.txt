Thank you all for the kind suggestions! Dirk's advice (in the same spirit
of Hadely's suggestion) should work like a glove !

For the record, I really appreciate how supportive the R community (and
this group in particular) is. Thanks a bunch and happy New Year!

best,
Rafa Pereira

Sharing here a solution I was happy with:

```{r, eval=!is.null(df), ...}

this has the advantage of hiding the distracting edge case handling from
the expository code being shown to the vignette reader.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Trying to submit a package
Message-ID: <EA5F6D2C-466E-48B3-B353-E44A2AFA49F7@noaa.gov>

Hi All:

In the process of trying to submit a new version of the package ?plotdap?,  I made my submission to CRAN,  I get the first initial response that takes me to the page where there is the 3 item check list,  I checked the items,  hit submit  (or whatever the button is called) and then it just hung instead of the usual return page and I did not receive the usual acknowledgement.  So I am not certain if the submission was successful.  Is there a way I can find out?  I don?t want to hit CRAN with two submissions of the same thing if the first one actually made it.

Thanks,

-Roy

I'm not seeing that package on this dashboard:

https://r-hub.github.io/cransays/articles/dashboard.html

Which AIUI is just a UI on top of https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/

Thanks.  And do I have my dates correct,  that CRAN is open again for submissions again after the holiday break

   CRAN submissions are closed so I'm not surprised if something didn't 
work.

   The 'foghorn' package provides a nice R interface to the CRAN queue; 
foghorn::cran_incoming() for the whole queue, or 
cran_incoming("plotdap") just for your package.  (I don't see it, so I 
would wait until submissions re-open tomorrow and try again ...)

Thanks.  My bad.  I thought CRAN re-opened today.  Not a problem.

Happy new year to all.

First,  wait for the CRAN submissions to reopen (tomorrow I think).

Having said the above, I often get in trouble if I try to follow the cran link from my phone. Just click it again and repeat the process - cran will report that you have already submitted successfully, if your previous attrmpt was good. Also,
note that after a successful submission you immediately get a confirmation email. So its absence suggests that you have not confirmed your submission successfully.

All of the above is automatic, noreal burden on the cran team, to my understanding.

Hi All:

In the process of trying to submit a new version of the package ?plotdap?,  I made my submission to CRAN,  I get the first initial response that takes me to the page where there is the 3 item check list,  I checked the items,  hit submit  (or whatever the button is called) and then it just hung instead of the usual return page and I did not receive the usual acknowledgement.  So I am not certain if the submission was successful.  Is there a way I can find out?  I don?t want to hit CRAN with two submissions of the same thing if the first one actually made it.

Hello,

are you using devtools::submit_cran() to submit your package to CRAN?
I've seen a few developers posting about CRAN submission issues on
social media platforms too. My best guess is that each of them are
using devtools::submit_cran(), because submissions via the official
page <https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html> is still down;

"CRAN submissions will be offline from Dec 23, 2025 to Jan 07, 2026
-CRAN team vacation and maintenance work)

During this time, the submission of packages is not possible.

Sorry for any inconvenience."

Since these questions about CRAN downtimes keep popping up now and
then, would it make sense to have a standard "scheduled_maintenance"
file somewhere that can be parsed? Then devtools::submit_cran() could
look at that before attempting a submission. Even without that, I
guess devtools::submit_cran() could check the source for
https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/ to see that there are no input
fields in the HTML <form> tag.

My $.02

thanks.  As I said,  it was my bad.  I mistakenly thought CRAN submissions resumed today.  I will re-submit tomorrow.

I wanted to circle back on this old thread (from back in November 2025!)

Thanks to the excellent advice received (see previous responses in this
thread), I managed to (a) reproduce the errors and (b) fix them, with the
eventual result that fastTopics is back on CRAN. It was a long road, so I
wanted to briefly share with all of you the steps I took to reproduce the
errors that arose in the "clang USBAN" test environment (I'm ignoring steps
that were specific to fastTopics and therefore unlikely to be of interest
to others). Perhaps these instructions will be useful to others who find
themselves in a similar situation:

# Steps taken to replicate clang USBAN test environment.
# See these links for more details:
# https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/clang-UBSAN/fastTopics/
# https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/README.txt
# https://github.com/rocker-org/r-devel-san-clang
docker pull --platform linux/x86_64 rocker/r-devel-ubsan-clang
docker run -lm -v $(pwd):/data -ti rocker/r-devel-ubsan-clang
cd /data
apt-get update
apt-get install cmake
Rdevel --no-save
> install.packages("rmarkdown")
> install.packages("remotes")
> library(remotes)
> # Now install fastTopics.
export UBSAN_OPTIONS="print_stacktrace=1"
Rscriptdevel --vanilla single_cell_rnaseq_basic.R \
  > single_cell_rnaseq_basic.out 2> single_cell_rnaseq_basic.err

I'll note that Ben was correct in his speculation about the source of the
"null pointer" errors, although there was an additional error that arose
from an edge case that I failed to handle.

More generally, my takeaway from this experience is that we (the R package
developers) have been spoiled to have so many user-friendly resources that
mimic the CRAN test environments (e.g., winbuilder), and it was a very
steep learning curve to do this manually with the Docker containers
(generously provided by Dirk).

Thanks for this end-of-fix update. I really appreciate when people
report on the "solution" like you do here.

Seconded!  (And always very happy to see these tools used!)

The only micro-hint I'd add is that (for a fair subset of packages) you can
use `apt` when installing some dependencies (that you do not need for ASAN /
UBSAN).  I have wondered about switching to Ubuntu to take advantage of r2u
here but the underlying Debian container here gives us newer gcc (or clang,
respectively) which we generally need. I could get clang nightlies for
Ubuntu, gcc is trickier.

I can reach it from your work address but not from my home address.  When I do a traceroute from home I get blocked at the last step.

Hmmm, I tried from my phone and it worked once, but I tried again now and
it didn't work either. This is the traceroute I see, in case it means
anything to anyone.

clearly that should be from ?my work address ? IP.  I think it is real,  just appears to be selective,  such as something is blocking a range of IPs.  I have seen this when things like Akamai or Cloudfare or the like are in front of a server,  they decide that something should  be blocked.     I can provide traceroute  results if that would help.

My traceroute reaches 193.171.13.18 and then fails.

It seems some people tried to submit with devtools during the CRAN 
vacations while the submission webpage was deactivated.
Not sure what devtools does, but it seems some partial submission was 
possible that way (just incomplete) and that may have caused a pattern 
that lead to the IP block.

At least we had some reports about the above mentioned szenario. The 
sysadmin team tries to resolve this.
Perhaps simply send your IP to cran-sysadmin at R-project.org
for a quick solution.

Best,
Uwe

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R mac builder, c++
Message-ID: <005201dc8183$a107bcd0$e3173670$@gmx.de>

Dear CRAN maintainers,

 

(I am writing to this list since I guess you read it anyway, and there isn't
any "contact information" at the R Mac Builder site.)

 

The Mac Builder service does not seem to compile even a basic Rcpp package
anymore, see here:

 

https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/results/1767974115-2b3446b6016a0ee3/

 

#include <cmath> is not found, same for #include <iostream>. Some help on
this issue would be greatly appreciated.

 

Best wishes,

 

Matthias

- A new Rcpp version is currently under reverse dependency checks on CRAN.

- In general report issues with the macbuilder service to its 
maintainer, Simon Urbanek.

Matthias,

thanks, now fixed:

https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/results/1767996503-3a8243f5318cf480/

It's the old Xcode update bug which can be fixed with
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++

Cheers,
Simon

PS: contact info is on the main page (=me, preferred) or R-SIG-Mac.

The CRAN sysadmins resolved the issues, all blocked IPs should be 
cleaned up and submission should work for everybody again (not only the 
hundreds (!) of  submissions we received successfully within 2 days)

Best,

Thanks for the fix!

Happy to chat about what devtools could do better here to avoid future
problems.

We try to find out why submissions got blocked. I guess devtools tried 
multiple times to open some webpage that was shut down and then the 
corresponding IP got auto blocked for too many connections within a time 
frame (which is why I get blocked by WU Vienna few times a year). We 
hope to get feedback from the sysadmins soon.


Best,
Uwe

Yep, for what it's worth, I also don't think it is 'the code' that drove it
(as I am using a derived piece) but likely rather repeated (?) usage. At some
point, I too got tired of the webform, and also got equally tired of the
[redacted] interaction enforced by devtools so I abstracted out a simpler
version of it leaning on the basic REST calls (that devtools so nicely
compiled). I put that in a script `crup.r` (CRan UPload script) that is part
of littler.  Been using it for a few months now for my uploads, and without
issues. It worked before the winter break and also worked afterwards for (so
far) three package uploads so seemingly I did not get blacklisted. YMMV.

Cheers, Dirk

For what it is worth in my case as far as I can tell the behaviors of both devtools::submit_cran and the cran machine were quote reasonable,  even if it caused me a little pain.  The block Uwe describes sounds like fail2ban or the like,  and given the junk we see hitting our services  it is a reasonable thing to run.  I had the day wrong when I thought cran was back up.  devtools on submission said ti couldn?t connect,  It is not unreasonable as a submitter, thinking the machine was back up,  to wait a bit,  and  try again,  and maybe do so a few times throughout the day.  That is indeed what I did.  Then to be sure it wasn?t a devtools problem I went to the web page  and that is when it seemed to block me. 

So my point is everything to my mind behaved reasonably.  The only thing I could suggest,  and I have no idea of how much work this would entail, and I am not looking to make work for people,  is perhaps a banner on the webpage when the service is down,  and if possible have the server return to programs  like devtools an error that the service is down.

I can?t speak for why others were blocked,  but as I said this all seems reasonable.

Thanks,

-Roy

That?s the thing - there *was* a red banner that said no submissions are accepted so everyone using the official CRAN way was fine, it?s the back-door access by devtools that caused the problems. The issue is that once devtools got you blocked, it was too late so you couldn?t go back and see that you were not supposed to use it since your IP was already on the blacklist even for the official front-end. Clearly, devtools needs to be fixed to make sure it?s not submitting things blindly when it?s not supposed - probably with some help from the CRAN admin team to make sure there is a well-defiled path for this.

Cheers,
Simon

Would it be possible for the form to be blocked as well as the submission
page? Typically web servers return a 404 or a 403 when a page isn't
available.

I can of course scrape the submission page, but now that the message is
gone, I don't know what to look for.

I believe it would be better to use the *503 status code. *It indicates
that the server is busy, overloaded, or down for maintenance

The HTTP Retry-After response header indicates how long the user agent
should wait before making a follow-up request. There are three main cases
this header is used:

In a 503 Service Unavailable response, this indicates how long the service
is expected to be unavailable.

I checked the source code on submission page when it was still down; there
was an HTML <form> tag, but all <input> tags had been removed.

Submission via devtools went through and the CRAN incoming server responded
with the usual email asking the maintainer to confirm by going to the
"three-checkboxes" webpage. I didn't proceed from there.
