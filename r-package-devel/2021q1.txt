Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to get rid of R CMD check warning/note for new S4
 classes
Message-ID: <MN2PR19MB411083912CB5DB155BBE592192D30@MN2PR19MB4110.namprd19.prod.outlook.com>

Hi 

I am creating a few S4 classes for a package. These classes include slots set to classes obtained using setClassUnion (some common across the new S4 classes). The code is functional but `R CMD check` keeps on reporting notes or warnings whatever I try. I am pulling my hair on this one and would really appreciate some insight on what I am doing wrong. 

Below are some simplified versions of a real function, which each gives different note/warning:

* Option 1 returns a note

createyNewClass <- function(){
? setClassUnion("character or NULL",c("character","NULL"),where = .GlobalEnv)
? setClass('newS4Classe',
? ??? where = .GlobalEnv, 
? ??? slots = c(type = 'character or NULL'),
? ? ? prototype = list(type = NULL)
? )
}

R CMD check
* checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies ... NOTE
Warning: class "NULL" is defined (with package slot "methods") but no metadata object found to revise superClass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ".GlobalEnv"
Warning: class "character" is defined (with package slot "methods") but no metadata object found to revise superClass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ".GlobalEnv"


* Option 2: returns a WARNING

createyNewClass <- function(){
  setClassUnion("character or NULL",c("character","NULL"))
  setClass('newS4Classe',
?   ? slots = c(type = 'character or NULL'),
  ? ? prototype = list(type = NULL)
  )
}

R CMD check:
...
* checking for missing documentation entries ... WARNING
Undocumented S4 classes:? 
? "character or numeric"
All user-level objects in a package (including S4 classes and methods)
should have documentation entries.
...

Thanks

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] accessing call constructors in Cpp
Message-ID: <CAFL8AHoy8LO5h1YpchkrQOZj+FzjGsfcQrX_uOGLwvX4wXGx7A@mail.gmail.com>

This is maybe better suited for Rcpp-devel or another mailing list. If so,
I apologize. :-)

In a pet project I've been implementing quite a bit of a package structure
within Cpp, including classes to contain and manipulate structures. As a
final part of the implementation a user provided R function is to be
executed with some of the manipulated data. While my first intuition (and
the smart option) was to implement a method in R for extracting the
parameters and simply executing the call, I got curious as to how one could
do this in Cpp.

After researching I found myriad options, one simple method being
1) Create a list of named and unnamed arguments
2) Extract "do.call" as a Function,
3) Test that the function provided is either a CLOSXP (function) or CHARSXP
(or maybe STRSXP?) and then
4) execute the function call.
but while going further down and checking the source code for do_docall I
was curious about trying to recreate the call "the old fashioned way", but
in Cpp. After looking over how it was done in R-source and a few examples
online I tried implementing a simple call creation and evaluating it with
Rf_eval

```cpp
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>
//[[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP add_10_and_5(SEXP rho){ //rho is an environment (new.env() here)
SEXP REALSXP_10 = PROTECT(ScalarReal(10));
SEXP REALSXP_5 = PROTECT(ScalarReal(5));
SEXP out = PROTECT(LCONS(install("+"), LCONS(
  REALSXP_10, LCONS(
      REALSXP_5, R_NilValue
  )
)));
UNPROTECT(3);
return eval(out, rho);
}
```
(For those who read the old version of Advanced R, this is a very similar
to the R's C interface section on "PairLists")

Immediately intellisense warned me that "ScalarReal", "install", "lcons"
and "eval" are all undefined. However, a quick look in
src/include/Rinternals.h shows that they are forward-declared there, and
should (in my understanding) be defined. For good measures I tried
including every header iteratively to no avail.

While it is likely recommended to not do this (and the final product likely
will be implemented in R), I am curious why I seem unable to access these 4
from Cpp. I can't seem to spot the reason in the header file itself.

Best regards
Oliver

Try using their official names, Rf_ScalarReal, Rf_eval, Rf_install, etc.
You may have #defined R_NO_REMAP in code that you did not show us.

Hi Bill thanks for your answer,

The only part left out (which I only realized as I'm trying out your
suggestion) is an #include Rcpp in order to remove 5 errors thrown when
executing Rcpp::sourceCpp. I am guessing that the suggestion from RAPI to
always work with R_NO_REMAP defined is taken literally and that it is
defined in Rcpp.h or its dependencies.

But it is working, thank you! :-)
(continues to dive further down the rabbit hole)

Hi,

I have a Sweave vignette in a package I have written. When building, the
citations are not put into the pdf - perhaps because two passes of the
tex file are required but only one is executed. Is there a way to force
two passes of the tex file?

Kind Regards,

Jarrod

You should give a bit more detail (what exactly do you have in your 
vignettes directory? How are you processing it?), and maybe even a 
reproducible example if you can extract a minimal amount from the 
document and the .bib file.  I haven't used Sweave in a few years (I 
recommend switching to knitr's implementation of .Rnw processing), but I 
didn't have problems like yours in the past.

Dear Jarrod

It works for me with Sweave so perhaps we need some more details.

Dear Duncan and Michael,

Thank you for the quick replies. When trying to generate a reproducible 
example I realised I'd done something embarassingly stupid and the 
problem is now resolved.

Message-ID: <CAJdmaqSGTWbz0xpiJa0ArAOiUiqG+929Bq+yEfSQoxj4payqPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to update a package to conform to pass tests given
`_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=TRUE`.

In this package, we only use the package `httptest` during testing, but the
tests are (almost) meaningless if it is not installed, so I would like to
indicate that it is a required package rather than skipping tests if it is
not installed.

If I move `httptest` to Depends, then I get the error CRAN check note:
> Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ?httptest?
>   All declared Imports should be used.

I think this would best be solved by a DESCRIPTION field that indicates a
package is required, but only for tests, but I do not see such a field. The
only solution I can think of is to have a trivial import of `httptest` in
the main package to silence the NOTE. Is there a better solution?

This sounds wrong.  I don't know the httptest package, but I assume that 
since you were only using it for testing, I might be interested in using 
your package even if I wasn't interested in installing httptest.  Making 
it a hard requirement would force me to install httptest.

You *definitely* shouldn't include it in Depends:  that would force it 
onto the search list, and potentially break other things that I'm 
running, e.g. if they have name conflicts with it.

You *probably* shouldn't include it in Imports.  Why force me to load 
another package if I'll never use it?  There's a tiny chance that would 
push my memory use over the edge, and my own code would fail.

It should almost certainly be included in Suggests, and nowhere else.
If that means your tests are skipped, you should feel free to warn the 
user in your test messages:  but it shouldn't cause your tests to fail.

Most users aren't going to run your tests, so they shouldn't be forced 
to install software that would let them do so.

I guess my worry is that my upstream dependencies will break something
without knowing it because the tests won't fail unless httptest is
installed. I really wish there was a way to indicate dependencies for
testing purposes only.

(And, oops, you're right, I meant that I was considering including httptest
in Imports not Depends)

R CMD check --as-cran will give an ERROR if not all Suggest:ed

This can be overridden with R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false which may be
helpful if Suggests: has a long tail of dependencies, or a shorter test run
is desired.

The R Internals manual describes the variable as 

  '_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_'
       If true, give an error if suggested packages are not available.
       Default: true (but false for CRAN submission checks).

which highlights the different behaviour under --as-cran and without.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN check texi2dvi failure
Message-ID: <2d46e0d6-cf03-0d87-b183-ac09a311d623@gmail.com>

I am trying to debug a problem that is appearing in the linux and 
Solaris checks, but not Windows or Mac checks, of my package tsfa as 
reported at
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_tsfa.html

The problem is with re-building the vignette
   ...
   this is package 'tsfa' version '2014.10-1'
   ...
  checking re-building of vignette outputs ... [6s/9s] WARNING
  Error(s) in re-building vignettes:
   ...
     Running 'texi2dvi' on 'Guide.tex' failed.
     LaTeX errors:
     ! LaTeX Error: \verb ended by end of line.
   ...

In responding to the threat of removal I have also fixes some long 
standing warnings about adding imports to the NAMESPACE. The new version 
builds with --as-cran giving no errors or warnings with both R-devel on 
win-builder (2021-01-07 r79806) and on my linux machine (R 2021-01-08 
r79812 on Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia). When I submit it to CRAN the Windows 
build is OK but the same error happens at the 'texi2dvi' step in the 
debian vignette re-build.

This seems to happens after an example that correctly has a warning 
message (about Heywood cases). In my linux build the the warning happens 
but the message does not appear in the pdf output, so one possibility is 
that the handling of the warning on the CRAN Unix check machines fails 
to produce clean tex or suppress output. Another possibility is that my 
build using --as-cran is different from the actual CRAN build options. 
For example, my 00check.log shows
...
* checking package vignettes in ?inst/doc? ... OK
* checking re-building of vignette outputs ... OK
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK
* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... OK
...

so I am not sure if it uses texi2dvi. (I haven't used dvi myself for a 
long time.)

I'm not sure how to debug this when I can't reproduce the error. 
Suggestions would be appreciated.

When I run R CMD check on my Linux machine [*], I also
do not get an error.  But here is a guess: The error
mentions \verb, and the LaTeX manual says that \verb
should be followed by nonspace character.  But in the
vignette it is followed by a space.  Maybe using \url
in the vignette could fix the error?

kind regards

The problem is not in the Warning from the example but from the \verb commands in the references.
You use space to delimit the argument of \verb and I was surprised that it worked since TeX ignores spaces after commands. 
Apparently, this has been an exception for \verb but now this feature is considered a bug and hs been recently fixed, see the atacjexchange question below and the relevant paragraph from LaTeX News. Probably the linux machines have updated their TeX installations.

In short, changing the space tp  say  +  delimiter for \verb command should fix the issue.

Georgi Boshnakov

 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/566085/how-does-verb-detect-spaces-that-shouldnt-exist 

Avoid problematic spaces after \verb
If a user typed \verb?!~!?foo instead of \verb!~!?foo
by mistake, then surprisingly the result was ?!~!foo?
without any warning or error. What happened was that
the ? became the argument delimiter due to the rather
complex processing done by \verb to render verbatim.
This has been fixed and spaces directly following the
command \verb or \verb* are now ignored as elsewhere.

so I am not sure if it uses texi2dvi. (I haven't used dvi myself for a long time.)

I'm not sure how to debug this when I can't reproduce the error. 
Suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks Enrico for the great guess, and Georgi for the details.

If I omit the space as seems to be implied in some documentation, changing
   \verb <https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2006/03/working-paper-2006-3> .
to
   \verb<https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2006/03/working-paper-2006-3> .

then the R CMD check error "\verb ended by end of line" happens on my 
linux machine. I did not try replacing the space with another 
deliminator, which I guess would now be the correct way to use \verb. 
The solution of adding
   \usepackage{url}

and changing to
   \url{https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2006/03/working-paper-2006-3}.

does seem to work. (No "on CRAN" confirmation yet but I have not had the 
immediate pre-test rejection that I got previously.)

Yes, you would need to do that.

The risk of this change is that the URL may fail in CRAN tests; see the 
recent "URL checks" thread on R-devel for a discussion of ways in which 
this can happen even when the URL works for you.

Dear all,

our package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=replicateBE) shows an 
error on the windows development version (r79815); no errors on Linux 
(r79812, r79815, r79818).
See 
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64/replicateBE-00check.html
The link at the bottom of the page leads to an empty page and hence, is 
not helpful...

Any ideas what might be the reason?

Helmut

This happened yesterday to one of my packages, with a similarly cryptic
error page (just an "r" instead of a log), then got better by itself by
today. Most likely, some problems on the test machine.

Message-ID: <bf614212-4897-3562-4045-dbeba60d3d39@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a package with FORTRAN code using REAL(16) for accurate 
computations. This package has been on CRAN for several years, but now 
it suddenly fails on M1 Macs, apparently due to the use of REAL(16) - it 
cannot handle higher precision than DOUBLE PRECISION, i.e. REAL(8). How 
do I solve this problem? Is it possible to exclude a certain 
architecture/platform (that of M1 in this case)?

Kind regards,

Rampal Etienne

The (excellent, and early) post by two R Core members hints at specific
issues with Fortran:

   https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/index.html

It doesn't specifically mention lack of REAL(16) but it hints somewhat
strongly at Fortran still being worked on.

But from what I recall, 'long double' beyond 64 bit is not standard across
the other (formally support) platforms either.  Recall that you have

  > capabilities()[["long.double"]]
  [1] TRUE

now in r-release as well. Can you make your code switch between 64 and 128
bit doubles 'as available'?

I did a search for "_copy" on your Github source, and I see a dir 
containing that being created in a test (but apparently removed 
afterwards), and also being created in the sims.Rmd vignette without 
being removed (though a file in the directory is removed).

No idea why you see the NOTE only on some platforms.

Thanks Duncan

Yes the problem was that a dir was being created in the sims.Rmd vignette that was not being removed.

Thanks for helping identify the issue so quickly

You could mention that in the comments when you re-submit that these are 
correctly spelled.

Are you knowingly writing to a user library? If so, do not. If not 
explain to CRAN in your submission why you believe this is a false 
epositive.

I get errors when submitting my package. I didn't get the error when I submitted the first version of my package.

Here is the error:

There are two problems:

1. CRAN is flagging two words as misspelled (even though they are valid 
words in the OED, which is notoriously perscriptive).
2. "Writes to user library" --- This is the violation; an example in 
your package is trying to write to a folder in the user's library.

If you look at the check page: 
https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2021/2021-01-13_check_results_ftrCOOL.html 
(linked on the archived page), you see this:

 ??? > dir = tempdir()
 ??? > PredDisdir<-system.file("testForder",package="ftrCOOL")
 ??? >
 ??? > PredDisdir<-paste0(PredDisdir,"/Disdir/")
 ??? > ad1<-paste0(dir,"/disorderB.txt")
 ??? >

mat<-DisorderB(PredDisdir,binaryType="strBin",outFormat="txt",outputFileDist=ad1)
 ??? Warning in file(con, "w") :
 ???? cannot open file 
'/home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-devel-clang/Work/build/Packages/ftrCOOL/extdata/tempTable.txt': 
Read-only file system
 ??? Error in file(con, "w") : cannot open the connection
 ??? Calls: DisorderB -> readDisDir -> writeLines -> file
 ??? Execution halted

I think you can fix it by using tempfile() or tempdir() for the ad1 object.

Hope that helps,
Zhian

Hello,
I hope this email finds you well.
A few weeks ago, I got an email that only needs to change my <
doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00460> to preferred
<doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.00460> in the DESCRIPTION file from my previous
version 2.2.1.

Therefore, I changed doi in the DESCRIPTION file and submitted but got the
following:
package MRPC_2.2.2.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically,
please see the following pre-tests:
Windows: <
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/MRPC_2.2.2_20210109_071001/Windows/00check.log

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/MRPC_2.2.2_20210109_071001/Debian/00check.log
>
Status: 1 ERROR

Note, I submitted several versions of this package but never got this error
message on my computer (Mac and Windows). Still, I checked before submit
but no error messages.
Please see the test results of the previous version 2.2.1:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_MRPC.html

Could you please suggest to me what should I do? What's the problem?

Thank you so much for your kind help!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] how to deal with error warning that 'adegenet' (an
 existing package) does not exist,
 an error that does not occur on the win-builder?
Message-ID: <HE1P195MB01248AC59B5C0A84DF4F6C9FF0A50@HE1P195MB0124.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,


When submitting the new package AlleleShift (ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/AlleleShift_0.9.tar.gz), the following error message is returned, stating that the adegenet package does not exist (Debian: <https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/AlleleShift_0.9_20210117_061039/Debian/00check.log>

Status: 1 WARNING, 1 NOTE)

* checking data for non-ASCII characters ... WARNING
  Error loading dataset 'Poptri.genind':
   Error in .requirePackage(package) :
    unable to find required package 'adegenet'

This error message is puzzling to me:


  1.  The Adegenet package does exist: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_adegenet.html (updated on 2021-01-17 06:46:42 CET)


  1.  I do not get any such error warning when checking via the win-builder, checked again this morning



* R version

  3.6.3:

  https://win-builder.r-project.org/zlFmYb8K93eh/00check.log)

*

  R version 4.0.3:

  https://win-builder.r-project.org/xhlrty9E1Mea/00check.log

*

  R Under development (unstable) (2021-01-13 r79826):

  https://win-builder.r-project.org/Zq5VoF8PD3vb/00check.log


Hence I would welcome any suggestion of how the adegenet error message can be avoided.

Best - stay safe,

Roeland

Message-ID: <CAHTZEhCtW8TNvQqGGGRAkqv181V2gKx0-vW-Okm78_ADMFcJ0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

the CRAN checks show an error for my newly released package 'httpgd' with
'r-patched-solaris-x86':

Error: C++17 standard requested but CXX17 is not defined

It seems like 'rcppsimdjson' had the same problem (
https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppsimdjson/issues/7) and worked around it
by disabling some functionality with compiler flags.

I don't really know what the error means for the CRAN package. Will it be
removed if it is not fixed? The R extension documentation states that C++17
is supported since R 3.4.0, and I do have R >= 4.0.0 as well as C++17
specified in the DESCRIPTION file.
Or is there some way to indicate that Solaris is not supported? (I doubt I
will ever have users running it.)

Thank you for your help,
Florian

Clarification: An earlier release required C++17. Later releases relaxed
that. We only need C++11 these days. (And I just noticed that I should
updated Makevars.win accordingly but it really isn't a constraint with
Rtools4).

The test is still in configure though, and it appears that Solaris is still
having the same issue.  Here is what I did (where configure is once again a
shell script):

   CXX17=`${R_HOME}/bin/R CMD config --all | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^CXX17$"`

Fair question. I don't know the answer. As package authors we have no
sanctioned way to opt out.  FWIW I think the most 'aggressive' my packages
are in terms of C++ standard is currently C++14 (as e.g. RcppGeiger, which
isn't even on CRAN).

httpgd is a cool package by the way, I gave plotting to the webbrowser a
quick spin this morning.

Thank you for the quick response and the information.

For some reason the Solaris results have now disappeared completely from
the check results page. (Now there are some additional issues I have to
look into.)

I will wait for the rest of the checks to complete and might write a
similar shell script to yours if it's needed. Thanks for the code snippets.

Glad you liked it!

Message-ID: <CAK+wxiOxfUo8Af3R1kj4nEZwWmZVX1w9fDu6KL9ziAzCAGTKAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wanted to submit a new version of my package and I encountered issues
with boost when compiling it on R devel version for windows. (Please excuse
my stupidity, but I'm a complete noob in regards to compilers and C++)

A full error stack is accessible here (the Debian one worked without
issues):
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/RoBMA_1.2.0_20210119_161819/Windows/00install.out

I checked that removing all C++ code that contains anything boost related
resolves the issue, however, I did not encounter this error before.

An updated version of the code is accessible at GitHub
https://github.com/FBartos/RoBMA

Thanks,
Frantisek

It's actually a _linker_ error, see the 'multiple definitions' hint:

D:/Compiler/rtools40/mingw32/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/8.3.0/../../../../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe: D:/Compiler/rtools40/mingw32/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/8.3.0/libstdc++.a(cow-stdexcept.o):(.text$_ZNSt13runtime_errorC2ERKS_+0x0): multiple definition of `std::runtime_error::runtime_error(std::runtime_error const&)'; distributions/DTboost.o:DTboost.cc:(.text$_ZNSt13runtime_errorC2ERKS_[__ZNSt13runtime_errorC2ERKS_]+0x0): first defined here

I have had similar issues when including something twice or more times that
was meant to be included only once. It could also be a setup issue. Bit hard
to tell but I don't have spare cycles to dig deeper now.

thanks for the quick response Dirk,

I did more digging and found that the error is caused by a single line (in
bold bellow, commenting it out and defining log_lik = 0 does not trigger
the error) but I have absolutely no idea why it is creating the problems

#include "DTboost.h"
#include <util/nainf.h>
#include <cmath>
#include <rng/RNG.h>
#include <boost/math/distributions/non_central_t.hpp>

using std::vector;
using std::log;
using boost::math::non_central_t;
using boost::math::pdf;

namespace jags {
namespace weightedt {

DTboost::DTboost() : VectorDist("dnt_boost", 3) {}

// some additional functions

double DTboost::logDensity(double const *x, unsigned int length, PDFType
type,
 vector<double const *> const &par,
 vector<unsigned int> const &len,
 double const *lower, double const *upper) const
{
  // the sigma parameter is ignored
  double ncp   = *par[0];
  double df    = *par[2];

  // create the boost distribution
  non_central_t t_dist(df, ncp);

  // compute the log likelihood
*  double log_lik = log(pdf(t_dist, *x));*

  return log_lik;
}

// some additional functions

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] GitHub Actions - CI for pkg that depends on
 Java/rJava (Windows issue)
Message-ID: <D3611E1D-4C78-4C6E-AC3A-F75C31EAA039@uni-due.de>

Dear colleagues,

as recommended by rOpenSci (see https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/11/19/moving-away-travis/) , I am moving to GitHub Actions for the CI for my R packages.

My test case is the ?bignlp? package I currently develop (https://github.com/https://github.com/PolMine/bignlpPolMine/bignlp). It is an interface to use the CoreNLP tools which are written in Java. (To explain: Unlike other existing packages that interface to CoreNLP, my intent is to make full use of Java multithreading.)

Having used `usethis::use_github_action_check_full(),  CI works almost out of the box on the Ubuntu and macOS test environments. But I have a problem to ensure that rJava can find Java. The error I see (Windows, both architectures):

Error: Error: R CMD check found ERRORs
Execution halted
.onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
call: inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...)
error: unable to load shared object 'D:/a/_temp/Library/rJava/libs/i386/rJava.dll':
LoadLibrary failure: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

(For the full log, see: https://github.com/PolMine/bignlp/runs/1749892186)

My first take was to add a step that would make sure that Java is present to .github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml:

      - name: Install Java
        uses: actions/setup-java at v1
        with:
          java-version: '8'
          java-package: jdk

But that only breaks things CI on Linux without having any change on Windows.

I have consulted the manual ?GitHub Actions with R? (https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/), but it does not address Java issues. I tried to find some R package on GitHub that would have rJava as a dependency and that uses GitHub Actions for CI ? without success.

This is why I?d like to query your experience: How I can make GitHub Actions work on Windows for the scenario of a package that depends on Java/rJava. Many thanks in advance!

Kind regards
Andreas (Bl?tte)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rdmacros as Suggests rather than Imports
Message-ID: <CAFUVuJwhHXwc-ENHhus2ygRM+nEky1_mfyqYmb72s+8PCGG+8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I'm writing to see if anyone has suggestions for how to handle an issue I'm
facing with the clubSandwich package (
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clubSandwich; Github repo:
https://github.com/jepusto/clubSandwich). The package documentation uses
the fairly new package mathjaxr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mathjaxr;
Github repo: https://github.com/wviechtb/mathjaxr) so that the help
packages can include mathjax formulas. Using mathjaxr requires adding it as
a dependency (in Imports) and in the Rdmacros field.

I recently learned that the Debian GNU/Linux team that handles R packaging
has trouble with the mathjaxr package, and consequently with any package
that has mathjaxr as a dependency. Thus, I would like to make
mathjaxr an optional feature, moving it from Imports to Suggests.
However, Writing R Extensions specifies that RdMacros packages must be
listed in Imports or Depends.

Does anyone have suggestions for a potential workaround for this situation
(short of entirely removing the use of mathjaxr)?

Kind Regards,
James

That is what Duncan did with rgl, from where this arose. (It's all very
inside baseball by for embedded 'minified' js files Debian 'ftpmasters'
[essentially our version of the CRAN desk accept/reject] also require full
source of the javascript file, which is not unreasonable -- but a bit of a
pain pain). Wolfgang (for mathjaxr) knows about it, and "time permitting"
packaging of mathjaxr may change. In the meantime the easiest os for you to
not use mathjaxr (I don't think the help page rendering mechanism has
optionality here) or for your corresponding Debian maintainer (CC'ed) to
patch it out (which is what I had done for the first rgl release with it).

Dirk,

Thanks very much for your input! By "patch it out" do you mean modify my
package description for the Debian distribution only? Would it work to
create a separate branch of my Github repo with modifications for the
Debian distro, and then submit that directly to Debian maintainers?

I'm sorry for my naivete here--I'm just not quite sure how to proceed.

I attempted to lay out two alternatives:

 i)  where you remove mathjaxr, the Debian package just follows
 ii) where you do nothing but the Debian package gets altered ("patched")
     and then differs in that only it no longer uses mathjaxr

I wonder if there's a way to define stubs for the macros in the package, 
and use mathjaxr versions only conditional on having it available?  I 
suspect that should be possible, but might require changes in R, not 
just in the individual packages.

As to the workaround in rgl:  since the mathjaxr macros are defined to 
be similar to the existing \eqn and \deqn macros in base R, it was easy 
to switch back to those and I (hopefully temporarily) dropped the 
mathjaxr dependency completely.  For a package that made more extensive 
use of math in the help pages it would be more work.

I had an idea along the lines of

\Sexpr[results=rd]{if (...) '\\newcommand{\\mjeqn}{...}'}

...but \Sexpr seems to be expanded too late in the Rd processing
pipeline for the \newcommand to have any effect. This also seems to
mean that it's impossible to dynamically load macro definitions
belonging to a different package from a \Sexpr:

% doesn't affect the rest of the document
\Sexpr[results=rd]{
 if (nzchar(f <- system.file('help/macros/mathjax.Rd', 'mathjaxr')))
  readLines(f)
}

An "optional mathjaxr" implementation will probably end up with its own
copy of man/macros/mathjax.Rd (but not the rest of MathJax), with \mjeqn
and friends defined to check whether mathjaxr package is available
before outputting MathJax markup or \eqn.

Loading the rest of the .Rd in the same \Sexpr where \newcommand{} is
evaluated (1) doesn't work because only one Rd section per \Sexpr is
supported and (2) would be a truly horrible hack if it worked.

Why are you listing the examples as \donttest?  If it's because they 
will fail on CRAN, wouldn't they fail on a user's system?  Then you 
should fix the examples so they don't fail.

If you marked them that way because they violate some CRAN policy (e.g. 
writing to a user's home directory), then you should fix them.  Those 
policies are there to protect users.

If you marked them that way because they take too long to run, then it 
seems like CRAN shouldn't complain about the run time.  I don't know if 
they do or not.

They do not, CRAN does not run --run-donttest examples regularly, only 
occassionally to see if these work, too. We do not complain about 
--run-donttest runtime unless it takes hours and it is unclear whoi is 
supposed to ever look at the examples then.

Message-ID: <CAC-MUvtvZJwxSmxbLv7t4cxBmt+CSxaCpPzHHG_o6W4kFXpA5Q@mail.gmail.com>

All,


The {targets} package shows an error on CRAN when checked with Solaris:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-solaris-x86/targets-00check.html.
The traceback points to to testthat::skip_if_not_installed("clustermq"). At
first I thought this was a race condition ({clustermq} in the middle of
installing) but then I noticed this same error happened in the same
platform on two different days (2021-01-21 and 2021-01-24). All non-Solaris
CRAN checks pass. I do not have a Solaris machine and cannot reproduce
locally on Mac, Linux, or Windows.

Hi!  Maybe try out things in a virtual 
machine in qemu or something?  

OT: Who uses Solaris anyway, I thought 
it was a long dead project after Oracle 
went in and bought Sun some ten odd 
years ago, contiued in the form of 
Illumos, SmartOS, perhaps now Oxide 
Computing?  Also: i386?? I think no one 
uses this ... this is really old and 
crusty stuff from 2007 [1] ...

Will,

I can help you get a Solaris VM, for VirtualBox or VMware, let me know
in private if you need one.

OTOH that crash is coming from a requireNamespace("clustermq", quietly
= TRUE) call, so it does not seem like it is your fault.

You could also try to reproduce this with `rhub::check()` and one of
the Solaris builders.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] how to set .Rbuildignore with respect to vignettes?
Message-ID: <AF16D43C-6413-4230-9BCA-3565A5039911@dal.ca>

SUMMARY QUESTION.

Should there be a `^vignettes$` line in `.Rbuildignore` files?


BACKGROUND.

I am trying to trim the size of the 'oce' package.  It has several vignettes, and I would like to learn how to include them optimally in my tarball.

The listing given in DETAILS reveals a duplicated vignette (`.Rmd`) file.  (I see such duplication for all the vignettes.)

The files in `oce/inst/doc` are created by `devtools::document(roclets = c('rd', 'collate', 'vignette')))` and so I am guessing that I should leave them intact.  However, I don't see the sense in the `vignettes` directory being included in the tarball, since it just contains duplicates of `.Rmd` files already included in `inst/doc`.

I wonder ... should add `^vignettes$` to my `.Rbuildignore` file to prevent the duplicates?  I can't find advice online that answers the question.

Thanks.  Dan Kelley, Dept. Oceanography, Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada.


DETAILS.

This is what I have at present.

Thank you, G?bor. After thinking it over, I have decided to try
skip_on_os("solaris") before any call to
skip_if_not_installed("clustermq"). If the issue persists in the next CRAN
submission, I will reach out again about obtaining a Solaris VM. I tried
rhub::check_on_solaris() but encountered an error compiling clustermq:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/targets_0.0.1.tar.gz-c790896701344ecc8ed4d98da5102e66
.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Testing on old R versions
Message-ID: <ded3841e-686a-ad53-585f-6e3c26c11acf@gmail.com>

I just received a bug report about the rgl package:  it claims to depend 
on R >= 3.2.0, but actually uses the hcl.colors() function that was 
introduced in R 3.6.0, so fails to install.  (This dependence was 
introduced while I had the dependence stated as R >= 4.0.0 for a while, 
until I tried to help people stuck on old releases; I fixed some of the 
4.0.0 needs, but missed this one.)

So of course what I should have done was to run the checks on R 3.2.0 
(and maybe intermediate versions) to confirm it works, but I didn't try 
that before releasing to CRAN.

I've just finished installing a copy of R 3.2.0 and testing my fix, so I 
think things are fine now.  This took some work; some of the packages 
used by the current rgl didn't exist when R 3.2.0 was current, so no 
binaries exist for them; installing the tools for binary builds takes 
time, etc.

So finally, my question:  what is the recommended way to handle tests of 
new packages on old R versions?  Do docker or other images exist that 
are already set up and ready to go?

I've used the https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/r-base images for this, and
they appear to go back to R 3.1. Likewise
https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-ver. The latter uses MRAN to install
packages from a CRAN snapshot corresponding to the release, so that should
also help with dependencies.

The Rocker Project provides both rocker/r-ver (with package snapshotting) as
well as the (much smaller, just R) rocker/r-base images which are then passed
on to the Docker team to become the official r-base image.

These go back to 3.1.3 with (almost if not all) interim releases, see

   https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base?tab=tags

and just use, say, 'docker pull r-base:3.2.0'

(Because they are available as these 'r-base' I initially didn't initially
tag them at the rocker/r-base side so there tags only started at 3.6.3.)

For the use case of testing rgl you may need to find the appropriate opengl
libraries for the particular release. These r-base images are all Debian
based, and Debian has a handy 'time machine' feature in snapshot.debian.org
which also lets you pick dates to install .deb binaries from. That should
make rgl testing easy in case you need older versions of the build
dependencies.

Thanks Dirk, Neal and Nathan.  I ended up going with Dirk's suggestion.

So far I haven't got it to work in 3.2.0; I probably won't put much 
effort into supporting that old version.  But it's fine in 3.4.0 and 
3.5.0, and I'm trying 3.3.0 now.  Rocker rocks!

P.S. rgl now installs in the basic r-base container, without adding 
additional libs.  This is due to some config checks that let it run on a 
barebones machine:  it can still produce WebGL output for a browser, it 
just can't show it on screen.

Most excellent, didn't know that part.  Ping we off-list if you're interested
in automating this, I also use these containers (or sometimes extensions with

can be pretty straightforward and self-contained.  It's easiest to instrument

Hi,

you're probably already aware of it, but 'rgl' depends on 'magrittr'
which depends on 'rlang', and the latter requires R (>= 3.3.0).


BTW, I find Singularity (https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/) more
convenient to work with than Docker, e.g. you run as host $USER also
"inside" the container, $PWD and your $HOME folder is automatically
mounted, the built container is a single executable (just like any
other software you run).   Here's how you can use Rocker's r-base with
Singularity on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04):

# Download and build

{host}$ cd /tmp
{host}$ singularity build r-3.3.0.sif docker://r-base:3.3.0

{host}$ ls -l r-3.3.0.sif
-rwxr-xr-x 1 hb hb 385630208 Jan 28 16:05 r-3.3.0.sif


# Run as-is

{host}$ ./r-3.3.0.sif

Copyright (C) 2016 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
...

> quit("no")

Comment: There's also a 'singularity {run,exec,eval} ...' similar to
'docker' which comes with more features but lots can be done without
it.


# Persistent package installs to host via custom R_LIBS_USER

{host}$ cd /tmp
{host}$ mkdir R-libs-3.3.0

So, running R via Singularity is almost the same as running R directly
on the host.

Thanks, I'll try Singularity out.  (I tried it, but got some weird game 
playing when I tried to do my first build.  Strange.)

By the way, I've been thinking of downgrading the magrittr dependency to 
Suggests.  The only reason it is currently Imports is so that rgl can 
re-export the pipe operator, and users don't need library(magrittr) to 
use it.

rgl itself never uses anything from magrittr, and will work just as well 
with the R-devel proposed pipe:  but if I'm trying to support ancient R 
versions, I won't be able to use it for a few years.

I've just tried this, and rgl still won't install in 3.2.0.  I guess 
this is because some of the other dependencies import magrittr, and/or 
there are other post 3.2.0 needs.  In any case, I'm not too worried 
about that ancient of a version.

For the reference, we support R-release, R-devel, and the last four
versions of R:
https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/.

We automatically run checks on all these R versions using GitHub
actions. You can use the same config as us by running
usethis::use_tidy_github_actions(). If you're already using GitHub,
I'm pretty confident that this is the fastest/easiest way to check
with older versions of R.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using a package only at install time?
Message-ID: <2ff77c47-60d0-bf4e-2556-f5e85362aed8@gmail.com>

I am trying to modify the mathjaxr package so that the tarball includes 
full source code to Mathjax, but only a minified version gets installed. 
  This will save space on the user's system, and should make it run a 
tiny bit faster.

To do this, I am trying using js::uglify_files in a src/install.libs.R 
file, and that's the only place the js package is needed.  I want a way 
to say that js *must* be present to install mathjaxr, but doesn't need 
to be loaded when mathjaxr is loaded.

Adding

   LinkingTo: js

to the DESCRIPTION file seems like it would do this, but checking says:

NOTE
'LinkingTo' for ?js? is unused as it has no 'include' directory

Is that an ignorable NOTE?   If not, is there another strategy for 
minifying Javascript files at install time?

I am trying out a modified version of the tidyverse actions, and it does 
seem to be going well.  Just one question:

rgl has a soft dependency on alphashape3d, and alphashape3d has a hard 
dependency on rgl.  This means that I need to install in the order

   rgl hard dependencies
   rgl
   rgl soft dependencies

Currently I'm using this code to do that:

   # First install rgl with minimal deps then the rest
   devtools::install()
   remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)

but devtools seems unnecessarily heavy for this.  Does remotes have a 
way to specify the install in the right order?

I forget all the details here but instead of `devtools::install()`,
I'm pretty sure you can just use `remotes::install_local()`.

We also have an experimental workflow that uses pak
(https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/check-pak.yaml);
and pak should know enough about the full dependency graph to install
all dependencies in the correct order without additional work. This
workflow (and pak) itself, is still a bit experimental but we've
started to move the tidyverse workflows to use pak, and haven't had
many problems recently.

Do you actually experience any problems, if you don't treat this case specially?

AFAIR, in most cases this is not a problem in practice. remotes might
install the CRAN version of rgl as the dependency of alphashape3d, but
`R CMD check` will install and use the local copy of the rgl package
for the check, anyway, so that does not matter much.

More precisely, it would only matter if alphashape3d had some install
time dependency on rgl, because at install time, it will use the CRAN
rgl version. But this is pretty rare I think.

If you still want to fix this, you can replace
`remotes::install_deps()` with `remotes::install_local()` and then
remotes will install the local package as well, not only its
dependencies.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN submissions
Message-ID: <CAN+W6_u76QkAzGvdzUJtcn6KDecm3XbPMY6oR5PN_ySxYoJTFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Some time ago, there was a question[1] about "how long is the average
waiting time when submitting a new package ("newbies") until you get a
manual reply or it's on CRAN, submitting an update with all OK before
it hits CRAN".

I have analyzed the data provided by cransays[2] (Many thanks!). You
can find it on this post https://llrs.dev/2021/01/cran-review/
Some key points:
 - Most submission happens in the first days of the week and towards
the middle of the month
 - Most of the submissions disappear from the CRAN queue in less than a day.
 - There's a new package submission to CRAN every hour.
 - It was impossible to know when there was a reply from CRAN, as no
information is openly available.
 - Not possible to know when a package is all OK before it hits CRAN
as some packages remain in the queue even after acceptance (perhaps
with metacran this could be answered).

Hope it's a useful guide. Thanks to the CRAN reviewers for their task,
Best,

Llu?s

Yes, what was happening was that remotes::install_deps skipped 
installing rgl from CRAN because the local copy had a later version 
number.  Sorry, I deleted most of the runs that had failures in them, so 
I can't quote the exact message about this.

I just re-ran a version of the old one.  I'm caching package builds, so 
now I get alphashape3d anyway, but in case you're interested, the 
message was:

  Skipping 1 packages ahead of CRAN: rgl

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Advice on R-forge to Github migration
Message-ID: <becd3ae6-d4fe-c9c8-be5b-25ca89a6d6c5@gmail.com>

rgl has been on R-forge for a long time, but I am now planning on 
migrating it to Github.  I really dislike git, but Github offers enough 
benefits, and nowadays I'm familiar enough with them, that I think I'd 
be better off there.

The easiest way to do this would be to do almost nothing:  just declare 
the the dmurdoch/rgl fork of r-forge/rgl is now where all new changes 
will be committed.

Can anyone else who has done this migration tell me if there there any 
disadvantages to this that I don't know about?  What I know:

  - I'll lose the bug reports and forum discussions that were sent to 
R-forge.
  - I'll need to do a bit of work to change dmurdoch/rgl to a more 
standard R package layout, but this should be quite easy:  basically 
just moving the files in pkg/rgl to the top level.  I assume "git mv" 
will keep their history if I do this.

I've moved history and issues from R-Forge to GitHub for half a dozen
R packages. I might be able to do this rgl. At minimum, I could help
you do it.

Yes, git mv will retain the file history.

   I think it should be fine to have your package in a subdirectory: 
this works as expected.

remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl/pkg/rgl")

   The only disadvantages to this structure are (1) it's a little bit 
surprising to users (who might try install_github("r-forge/rgl" and 
wonder why it didn't work and (2) setting up Travis machinery takes a 
little more effort to get all processes to work in the proper 
subdirectories (see the glmmTMB package for examples).

  I'm not very good at Git, but always get a bit confused when I try to 
track changes in a file that has moved ...

Technically, git does not record file history... it records commit history, and reconstructs file history as needed. The contents of a file identify it uniquely among all commits ever made regardless of which directory it was ever in. IMO this is the main reason why git is superior and I put up wth the inconsistent command line interface because of it.

git mv is very simple [1].

I'm setting up Github actions instead of Travis; about a third of my 22 
failed attempts were caused by not dealing with the non-standard 
structure properly :-).

It's true that remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl/pkg/rgl") works, 
but the RStudio "New Project | Version Control | Git" menu isn't so 
forgiving, presumably because git isn't.

Given how long I've been using svn it may take me a while to recognize 
the benefits of this mindset, but I'll give it a try.

Thanks for the offer (and the more detailed one offline, where you 
recommend cloning the repository rather than forking it).  Just for 
future reference, could you tell me the benefits of cloning over forking?

We can discuss more offline, but at a high level:
  - if you fork my repo, mine is the head of the network graph
  - if you clone it and then push it to a repo in your account, yours
is the head of the network graph

Basically, I don't want your repo to be a fork of mine. That would
confuse users about where issues/PRs should be.  I plan to delete my
repo once you've loaded the copy to your account.

Right. This is probably because in some iteration you installed the
local (dev) rgl into the library that is cached.
It should still be harmless, because `R CMD check` uses the (new)
local package for the check. The old cached version is only used for
installing alphashape3d and other suggested packages that import or
depend on rgl.

In any case, `remotes::install_local()` seems to be the safest way to
go about this currently.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Cache in vignette not working when checking a package
Message-ID: <CACr7k5+QMqEM9=1J7tzUVfYd8uJWFzo5uQkN7-__aHDnZYYpwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have an issue when checking a package that includes a vignette using
cache = TRUE in some chunks. The vignette is generated with knit from an
Rnw document. The issue is that cache works when building the vignette
locally but it seems not working when checking the package.

I have proceeded as follows:

1) R CMD build collin --resave-data
      * creating vignettes...  --->  4 minutes
2) R CMD check --as-cran collin_0.0.1.tar.gz
      * checking re-building of vignette outputs ...  --->  4 minutes
3) I install "collin_0.0.1.tar.gz" in my laptop
4) In an R session, I build the vignette "collin/vignettes/collin.Rnw". It
takes 4.7 minutes and the "cache" folder is created in "collin/vignettes/"
5) I remove all aux files in "collin/vignettes/" (now, the only extra item
is the "cache" folder)
6) I re-build the vignette in the R session and now it takes only 8
seconds, so the cache is working
7) Repeat 5)
8) Repeat 1) and 2) but it still takes 4 minutes so it seems like R CMD
build and R CMD check are ignoring the "cache" folder in
"collin/vignettes/".

I would be very grateful if you could provide some advice on how to fix the
problem.

Best,

 Cache in vignette not working when checking a package

Dear Thierry,

Thanks for your advice. However, I would like to understand why when I
build the vignette to get the pdf from the Rnw, it takes just 8 seconds
once the "cache" folder has been created instead of the initial 4 minutes,
but this time reduction does not happen when checking the package.

Best,

Probably because the cache is not installed into the package. I'd check the
tar.gz file to see if the cache is present.

Indeed, the "cache" folder is not present in the tar.gz file. Could you
please help me on how to fix "the cache is not installed into the package"?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Undeclared packages ... in Rd xrefs
Message-ID: <b5605fd1-b8fe-6c3e-0824-7b1468c42d1b@beuth-hochschule.de>

Dear package developeRs,

under the Fedora clang checks, I find the note

"Undeclared packages ?FrF2?, ?DoE.wrapper?, ?sfsmisc?, ?DoE.MIParray?, 
?planor? in Rd xrefs"

for my package DoE.base. I understand that package planor has been 
archived from CRAN; I don't understand what is wrong with the other 
xrefs; only the R-Devel Fedora clang flavor seems to complain, and I did 
not find an explanation in the section on cross references in Writing R 
Extensions. Can someone explain the meaning of this note?

Thanks and regards,
Ulrike

There's a line in the Writing R Extensions manual section 2.5 
Cross-refernces for R-devel that says:

"Packages referred to by these ?other forms? should be declared in the 
DESCRIPTION file, in the ?Depends?, ?Imports?, ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields."

The other forms are the forms of links to other packages.  So presumably 
you don't mention those packages in your DESCRIPTION file.  Generally 
that means they should be listed in Suggests, which doesn't force them 
to be installed, but they will be installed during tests.  You might 
also argue they should be in Enhances, though that seems a worse fit.

Thierry very gently (yet correctly) suggested to have the "cached" results as
"precomputed" artifacts in the package to not require any compution at all.
So write, for example, a data.frame df as
     saveRDS(df, "inst/cachedData/data.rds")
and then in your vignette retrieve it as
     df <- readRDS(system.file("cachedData", "data.rds", package="mypkg"))
replacing "mypkg" with your package name.

Cheers, Dirk

Dear Dirk,

Thanks for clarifying, now I can see Thierry's point. But the issue is that
doing that my vignette would lose the "reproducible research" property
because the Rnw would need all those artefacts to reproduce the pdf. I know
I could combine Thierry's suggestion with playing with echo = TRUE/FALSE,
eval = TRUE/FALSE and purl = TRUE/FALSE in the chunks so that the pdf (and
the purled R file) looks like I don't save/retrieve partial results but I
would like to find a more elegant solution in which the Rnw reproduces the
pdf from scratch while taking advantage of "cache = TRUE" present in some
chunks, as we can do locally.

Best,


Jose Barrera

Where is the cache on your local system?  I think if it is in the 
vignettes/<vignettename>_cache directory, it would be installed (unless 
your .Rbuildignore file says to ignore it).

If you extract the tar.gz file into a new directory, does the cache end 
up in the same directory as the main vignette file?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] DOIs problem 'libcurl error code 35'
Message-ID: <5338c8b3-57e4-6f93-02d8-1b0d544aefb6@bsc.es>

Dear,

I am testing my package on win-builder before submitting it to CRAN.

There is only one error message due to DOIs access (see below). There 
are several DOIs but only 3 are failing that belongs to the American 
Meteorological Society (AMS).

I have tested them on my browser and I can access to the correspondig 
website.

I have looked for info and I found I need to use " the --resolve option 
of curl for this".

Does somebody knows how to do it? I wonder if I can set that option 
somewhere in the package.

Thanks in advance,

Kind regards,

N?ria


Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:

Thank you for the explanation! I will remove the xref to sfsmisc 
(because it does not make sense to suggest that package). The three 
other still available packages all depend on or import DoE.base. Thus, 
if I incorporate them in Suggests, I will create a circular dependence 
structure. Doesn't that create problems?

It creates small problems, not serious ones. You just need to make sure 
that a version of your package is available when those packages are 
installed for testing.  So things need to happen in something like this 
order on a totally new machine:

  - install the "hard" dependencies for your package.
  - install your package
  - install the "soft" dependencies for your package.

I just discovered that the remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE) 
function can't currently do things in the right order, but 
remotes::install_local(dependencies = TRUE) is fine.  I didn't check the 
base function install.packages(dependencies = TRUE).

Thanks again to all who wrote on this thread:  rgl now lives in git, 
with the main website now https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl.  Thanks 
especially to Joshua, who did most of the heavy lifting of actually 
importing the R-forge material.

Thank you! I don't like that very much, because exactly those users who 
are totally new to using R are extremely put off by this type of 
difficulty. I think that I will try to solve this differently, e.g. by 
showing the code for calling these help files from R without linking to 
them from within the Rd file. I am not sure what the benefits are of 
this demand - but I do see the drawbacks here.

Best,
Ulrike Gr?mping

Dear R developers,
I am facing an issue while submitting update to my package PGRdup (https://github.com/aravind-j/PGRdup).
With R-devel Debian (2021-02-05 r7994) on submission a WARNING was reported as follows. .
.
.
.Quitting from lines 536-542 (Introduction.Rmd) 
Error: processing vignette ?Introduction.Rmd? failed with diagnostics:
cannot xtfrm data frames
--- failed re-building ?Introduction.Rmd?
.
.
.
.

I am unable to replicate the same locally with the same version (2021-02-05 r79941) in Ubuntu 18.
Is this a false positive ? How to resolve this issue for successful submission.


Best Regards
J. Aravind

You should be able to reproduce and trace back the error by setting the
environment variable

_R_STOP_ON_XTFRM_DATA_FRAME_=TRUE

while running your vignette code.

This is not a false positive. You are probably trying to
order(data.frame) somewhere. I think this will be disallowed in future
versions of R, following an R-devel thread from last year:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2020-May/079500.html

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Two versions of package DLL?
Message-ID: <9bfdb9c5-9e9c-9db6-bfd5-4f52bf3533bc@gmail.com>

I'd like to install two versions of the rgl package DLL, with the 
.onLoad hook choosing which one to load.  Can anyone tell me of another 
package that does this successfully?

Here's the background:

Some MacOS users of rgl can't load it.  I think this is because of 
problems with XQuartz on their machines.  (See 
https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl/issues/11 for a couple of reports.)  I 
don't know if these users are using the new cpus or what else might be 
causing their problems.

I've set it up to allow users to skip everything related to X11 by 
specifying --disable-opengl when installing, and have attempted to make 
it do this automatically when configuring:  so I think the problem is 
solved for users who can install rgl from source.

I'd like to try to make a solution for users who can't build it, by 
installing two copies of the DLL: the regular one linked to the X11 
libraries, and one built with the --disable-opengl option.

This is somewhat similar to how things were handled on MacOS up to 2015, 
when a second DLL was built to use Apple's AGL, while the default used 
GLX.  I resurrected that old code and modified it for the current use, 
and it works, but generates two check issues:

1. The Makevars file had various GNU-isms.  I'd really like to see a 
successful package that does this without them, but I guess I can 
declare that it uses GNU make if I have to.

2. Routine registration seems to think the second DLL (called "nullrgl") 
is in a different package, so I get warnings like:

? checking foreign function calls ... WARNING
   Foreign function calls to a different package:
     .C(rgl_abclines, ...)
     .C(rgl_addtosubscene, ...)

     ...

     .Call(rgl_setWheelCallback, ...)
   Undeclared package in foreign function calls:
      ?nullrgl?

I am pretty sure this is a false positive in the checks, e.g. printing 
rgl_abclines shows this:


 > rgl:::rgl_abclines
$name
[1] "rgl_abclines"

$address
<pointer: 0x7f994a00f330>
attr(,"class")
[1] "RegisteredNativeSymbol"

$dll
DLL name: nullrgl
Filename:
 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/rgl/libs/nullrgl.so
Dynamic lookup: FALSE

$numParameters
[1] 4

attr(,"class")
[1] "CRoutine"         "NativeSymbolInfo"

The code in QC.R (here: 
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/8cf68878a1361d00ff2125db2e1ac7dc8f6c8009/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L2118) 
looks at the "DLL name", and ignores the fact that the path to the DLL 
is in the rgl libs directory.  I'll try to put together a patch for R 
that fixes this.

Greetings,

I have been trying to pass an R package (https://github.com/atmoschem/vein)
to CRAN but I`m finding this error on Windows-devel:

C:/rtools40/mingw32/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/8.3.0/../../../../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe:

`R_useDynamicSymbols'
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status
no DLL was created


I have used .Fortran without problems, but after a discussion in this
forum, I have started using dotCall64::.C64 with OMP

I created the init.c
with tools::package_native_routine_registration_skeleton(".") with the
correct number of arguments.

Thank you very much for your help

Message-ID: <8b793d35-a92e-e215-e70a-a3b95a695fab@gmail.com>

I think the WRE manual says that an R_ARCH environment variable will be 
set when subarchitectures are involved, but environment variables aren't 
accessible in Makevars.

Is there a standard way to get a value in Makevars which will match 
.Platform$r_arch once R is running?

If sub-shell is possible, will it be convenient?

 ? myvar=`R --slave --vanilla -e 'cat(.Platform$r_arch)'`

Something like that should work, but I'd have to make sure the R that it 
runs is the same one where the package is being installed.  And if I can 
do that, then I probably know the answer, don't I?

Actually, I probably misread the section about environment variables.

Hi 

I posted the following message on Jan 2nd and got no response... Assuming that my timing was off (everybody was probably still on vacation or recovering from New Year's celebration), I am taking the liberty to post it again, hoping that I'll reach a larger audience today.

------

I am creating a few S4 classes for a package. These classes include slots set to classes obtained using setClassUnion (some common across the new S4 classes). The code is functional but `R CMD check` keeps on reporting notes or warnings whatever I try. I am pulling my hair on this one and would really appreciate some insight on what I am doing wrong. 


Below are some simplified versions of a real function, which each gives different note/warning:

* Option 1 returns a note

createyNewClass <- function(){
  setClassUnion("character or NULL",c("character","NULL"),where = .GlobalEnv)
  setClass('newS4Classe',
    where = .GlobalEnv, 
    slots = c(type = 'character or NULL'),
    prototype = list(type = NULL)
  )
}

R CMD check
...
* checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies ... NOTE
Warning: class "NULL" is defined (with package slot "methods") but no metadata object found to revise superClass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ".GlobalEnv"
Warning: class "character" is defined (with package slot "methods") but no metadata object found to revise superClass information---not exported?  Making a copy in package ".GlobalEnv"
...

* Option 2: returns a WARNING

createyNewClass <- function(){
  setClassUnion("character or NULL",c("character","NULL"))
  setClass('newS4Classe',
    slots = c(type = 'character or NULL'),
    prototype = list(type = NULL)
  )
}

R CMD check:
...
* checking for missing documentation entries ... WARNING 
Undocumented S4 classes: 
   "character or numeric"
All user-level objects in a package (including S4 classes and methods) 
should have documentation entries.
...

Bit of information: I am running the R CMD check with R 3.6.1 (sorry, I cannot update on my corporate machine :( )

Thanks in advance for your help

Dear Sabastien,

Your second approach is correct, but as the warning suggests, you have to
document the S4 class "character or NULL". The documentation at
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Documenting-S4-classes-and-methods
should get you started.

Best,
David

Dear David,

A follow-up if you don't mind: one slot of my actual S4 object contains either NULL or a grid::frameGrob object. As you may know, frameGrob objects inherit from multiple S3 classes: "frame" "gTree" "grob" ?"gDesc".

Based upon my understanding of the documentation, I need to define my S4 class as follows using a setOldClass call for the S3 classes that are used in the setClassUnion call.

----
? setOldClass(c('frame','gTree','grob','gDesc'))
? setClassUnion('myFrame', c('frame','gTree','grob','gDesc','NULL'))
? 
? 
? setClass('myClass',
? ? where = .GlobalEnv, 
? ? slots = c(
????? grid.frame = 'myFrame',
? ? ),
? ? prototype = list(
? ? ? grid.frame = NULL,
? ? )
? )
----

This causes `R CMD check` to complain about "frame" "gTree" "grob"  "gDesc"
* checking for missing documentation entries ... WARNING
Undocumented S4 classes:
  "frame" "gTree" "grob"  "gDesc"
All user-level objects in a package (including S4 classes and methods)
should have documentation entries.

Including \alias{frame-class}, \alias{grob-class}, \alias{gTree-class}, \alias{gDesc-class} in my S4 class .Rd files prevents the WARNING to be reported, but this does not feel right, since these are classes from the grid package. Any suggestions?

Sebastien

Hi All,?
I am building a package for CRAN that uses some functions from the package shinyjs.
When I built my shiny app, I used the functions?useShinyjs and reset from the shinyjs package, and they worked perfectly.
I have transformed my app into a package for CRAN and now the functions from shinyjs no longer work.
I have researched the problem and asked on forums, but I have not been able to solve this problem.
I was wondering if anyone has encountered this issue before when packaging a Shiny app for CRAN, and if you might know what the problem/solution is.
If anyone has faced a similar issue and found a solution this would be greatly helpful to hear about.
Here is a link to my app wiki with the current code:?AlkaBenawra/MDMAPR

Hi there

Creating an R package here which I plan to upload to CRAN. Upon checking
the tarball created with `R CMD BUILD`, I try to use `R CMD CHECK` as
follows:

```
R CMD CHECK my_package.tar.gz --as-cran
```

This normally works smoothly. However, in this case, it is stuck on
`checking use of S3 registration` and has been there for several hours.
I've never experienced this before; here's the partial output I see:


```
...
 * checking package subdirectories ... OK
 * checking R files for non-ASCII characters ... OK
 * checking R files for syntax errors ... OK
 * checking whether the package can be loaded ... OK
 * checking whether the package can be loaded with stated dependencies ...
OK
 * checking whether the package can be unloaded cleanly ... OK
 * checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies
... OK
 * checking whether the namespace can be unloaded cleanly ... OK
 * checking use of S3 registration ...
 ```

(1) What does `checking use of S3 registration` really mean?

(2) More importantly, why could it be stuck here? How could I fix this
issue?

Any insight or help greatly appreciated. Thanks!

If GNU make is acceptable as a system requirement, you can get any R 
configuration/runtime variable in Makevars, e.g.

R_ARCH=$(shell $(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript -e 'cat(.Platform$r_arch)')

I wanted to avoid it, since WRE discourages it so strongly.  What I 
ended up doing is putting the following into src/Makevars.in:

all: $(SHLIB) @HIDE_IF_NO_OPENGL@ ../inst/useNULL$(R_ARCH)/$(SHLIB)

../inst/useNULL$(R_ARCH)/$(SHLIB): $(SHLIB)
	cp -R *.cpp *.c *.h OpenGL useNULL
	cd useNULL;$(R_HOME)/bin/R CMD SHLIB -o $(SHLIB);rm *.cpp *.c *.h 
OpenGL/*; cd ..
	mkdir -p ../inst/useNULL$(R_ARCH)
	mv useNULL/$(SHLIB) ../inst/useNULL$(R_ARCH)/


The $(SHLIB) target should already have the subarchitecture in it. 
@HIDE_IF_NO_OPENGL@ is set by configure to "#" if OpenGL is not 
available for the build, so the second make target would be commented 
out.  If it's not commented out, then I copy all the source files into 
src/useNULL, and in that directory, I make $(SHLIB) again.  (There's 
another Makevars.in in that directory that has different compiler and 
linker options than the main one.)  Then I move the result to 
inst/useNULL$(R_ARCH)/, which will be inst/useNULL in most cases, but 
will have a subarchitecture directory added on if necessary.

This is complicated, partly because  R CMD check  has a bug 
(https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18054) which means 
you will get check warnings if you try to register entry points in a DLL 
with any name except the same as the name of the package.  So to get a 
modified version of the main DLL, it has to have the same name but be 
stored somewhere else.

The version above passes checks, but it's pretty unusual, so I'm not 
certain it doesn't violate the intention of some rule or other.

Your LaTeX setup seems to have better Unicode support than the one
installed on CRAN machines. Try using tools::showNonASCIIfile on all
your *.Rd files to find the one containing a Unicode hyphen, then
replacing it with ASCII hyphen-minus.

I'm afraid that I'm finding your use of License: field a bit confusing.
"GPL-3 + file LICENSE" typically means that the package license
restricts a base license, the restrictions being provided in the
LICENSE file. In your case, LICENSE seems to contain the text
of Apache-2.0 license. Does it mean that some parts of the package are
GPL-3, while others are covered by the Apache license? If you want to
indicate that either license applies to the whole package, I think that
"GPL-3 | file LICENSE" would be a better fit. Apologies if you have
already clarified this particular usage with someone more knowledgeable
than me.

This is a frequent source of errors. Somewhere in your manual there is a 
unicode 2010 hyphen "?" ( https://www.compart.com/fr/unicode/U+2010 ) 
instead of plain ASCII hyphen "-". They look pretty similar, don't they? 
May be you did some copy/paste from e.g. a pdf file and thus got this 
character in your texts.

Supposing that it is not so critical for your documentation to have 
U+2010 char, you can replace it by a hyphen from your keyboard. To spot 
its exact place you can try |tools::showNonASCIIfile().|

|Best,
Serguei.|

Reporting when S3 methods in base/recommended packages are overwritten 
by the checked package. These things are documented in R Internals 
manual, search for _R_CHECK_OVERWRITE_REGISTERED_S3_METHODS_. In the 
source code 
(https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/check.R) look for 
the same variable or "use of S3 registration".

In principle, you could check if your package is doing something special 
re S3 methods registration and experiment with that to see when the 
problem disappears. Or you could debug on the R end (build R with debug 
symbols, run the example, connect to R via gdb, print the stacktrace, 
etc, etc.). Or create a minimal reproducible example so that someone 
else could do that, instead. In either case, it would be interesting to 
know the cause to see if the checking could be made more robust.

Message-ID: <1192151299.3435429.1613129303982.JavaMail.zimbra@psyctc.org>

This feels embarrassingly trivial compared with most of the posts I try to understand here: apologies.

I am taking my first clumsy steps to build my own library of source code functions I have created and use a lot and want to share with a few collaborators.  I tried once before, a few years ago and failed to show the perseverance to succeed.  With help from so many wonderful tools so many people have created, and working in Rstudio, I do now have a package with some functions that work and a bit of function documentation.  It's at https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns if that helps anyone help me with my questions below ... if you do look you'll see it's just a baby steps as yet and there's a huge amount still to do.

Q1: I don't envisage it ever going beyond github but I would still like to document it well.  I am starting to understand documenting functions using the Code, Document in Rstudio and seem to have found good examples and documentation for that.  However, I am failing to find similar information about creating the CECPfuns-package documentation I would like to build.  I have a CECPfuns-package.R that I think I created with a packaged function that generates that skeleton (embarrassingly, I have forgotten now what that was).   I think that created my CECPfuns-package.Rd so I do have a vestigial answer to CECPfuns-package.  I also have a CECPfuns-package.Rd file generated with utils::promptPackage but I have left this in my package root directory (against the warning note) as it looks as if people recommend creating package documentation from *-package.R files in the R directory and I guess I'd prefer not to have to learn .Rd syntax if I can stick with working from R (or Rmd?).  I did create a minimal one but CECPfuns.R (in the R directory) but I'm not sure what syntax I should be using to build on that.  So ...  I would really like to find advice on how to build CECPfuns-package docucmentation from that file or I'd love it if someone has created package documentation from a *-package.R file they'd be willing to share with me.

Q2: I think I have realised that the html structure for packages that I'm so used to on CRAN isn't built by default when you build a package and I think the process may be automated by the pkgDown package and I've tried that putting the output (again, against the warning note) into tempDir below my package root.  Again, though the documentation for pkgDown seem clear on the functions it seems (to me) thin on exactly what is being done and how, assuming it's possible, to elaborate on the html that generates, I am failing to find more on those topics.  
Q2a: is there any danger of overwriting anything important in my minimal github repository were I to use pkgDown::build_site() to write directly to that repository?
Q2b: is there more documentation on enhancing the site build_site() creates that I can read?

TIA and very best to all,

Chris

I think that created my CECPfuns-package.Rd so I do have a vestigial answer to CECPfuns-package.  I also have a CECPfuns-package.Rd file generated with utils::promptPackage but I have left this in my package root directory (against the warning note) as it looks as if people recommend creating package documentation from *-package.R files in the R directory and I guess I'd prefer not to have to learn .Rd syntax if I can stick with working from R (or Rmd?).

There are two general approaches for writing help pages in R.

The older approach (that I use) is to use functions like prompt() and 
promptPackage() to create skeletons of documentation in the man 
directory, then edit them by hand.  The main disadvantage of this 
approach is that the Rd format is pretty ugly:  it's kind of like LaTeX, 
but different enough that even if you know LaTeX, you'll have to spend 
some time learning it.  It's also a bit of a pain to keep your 
documentation in sync with your source code:  when you change the 
arguments to a function, you don't get automatic changes to the help page.

RStudio has pretty good support for this approach, in that you can 
preview the pages as you work on them, it knows a bit about their syntax 
so things are highlighted nicely, and there are easy methods to jump 
from a function to the corresponding .Rd file.

To set this up you uncheck the "Generate documentation with ROxygen" 
option in the project build tools options.  That's it!

The approach that a lot of newer packages use is to generate the .Rd 
files from comments in the .R files using Roxygen2.  In recent versions 
of Roxygen2, what you type can be entered in Markdown instead of Rd 
format.  Some parts of the Rd file will be generated automatically, so 
you don't need to type them at all:  that's another advantage.

What I don't like about this approach is:

  - Mixing source code and documentation makes your source files bigger 
which discourages careful documentation and makes it harder to read the 
code.  Source and docs are different things, so in my opinion, they 
shouldn't be mixed in the same file.

  - I don't think RStudio supports a "Preview" for the help page for a 
function (but I might be wrong about this, since I don't use it much).

On the other hand, it's definitely quicker to learn and to get minimal 
documentation out of the Roxygen approach.

In my opinion, what would be ideal is to have separate files for source 
and docs, with a less ugly format for the docs, and some kind of 
automatic link between source and doc files so updates to one are 
reflected in the other (or at least differences are signalled).

Yes. I can see the arguments you make below about mixing source and 
documentation but I have found the Rstudio help with documenting 
functions at least a very good starting point.  It, i.e. Rstudio,
just doesn't seem to have created something for documentation of a
package.

Yup.  I like it!

Again, yes, I have been following the "Rstudio wrapped" version of this
so far and again, can see your points but it feels a bit the mixing of
code and commentary feels familiar to me from mixing code blocks and 
text blocks in Rmarkdown (I can see it's not quite the same but I think
some years now using Rmarkdown made this easier to accept and start 
using).

I haven't found it if it is there.  I'm guessing you use ESS?

Understood and all helpful and reassuring me that I may not have missed something
very obvious.  In some ways the funny thing about creating a xxxx-package.R file
to create the package document is a sort of edge case of what you're saying: it's 
creating a file that says it's a source code file when it won't actually contain
any source code at all!  However, I think that's what I see pointers suggesting
it's what I should do ... but not much on how.

Do you or anyone else have an example of a ****-package.R that Rstudio's check has built into a package documentation file that was well populated and useful?

I think that's the key exemplar I am seeking and I'm finding it hard to craft any web search that finds me such a thing.

Any offer?!  TIA,

Apologies, I could have phrased this better.

If you want the whole of your package to be distributed under the terms
of Apache-2.0 or GPL-3 license (at the user's choosing), the following
DESCRIPTION fragment seems to be the way to express that intent:

License: GPL-3 | file LICENSE

> What is the better thing to put if I do not want to put

Personally, I would keep things simple by choosing only one license.
Exactly which one to choose is a question of personal preference, as
such known to result in flame wars, so I must try to stay neutral.

For R packages, the line between Apache-style "please retain the
copyright notice if you redistribute" licenses and GPL-style "please
share your improvements as source code if you redistribute" is somewhat
blurry, since people typically share source .tar.gz packages anyway,
thus fulfilling the terms of both licenses. The differences only come
into play only when other people distribute the _binary_ packages built
from your source code they _modified_.

Perhaps re-reading WRE 1.1.2
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Licensing> or
consulting websites like <https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/licences/> or
<https://choosealicense.com/> would help?

Chris,

I have migrated from Travis CI to using GitHub actions with pkgdown to build websites for packages - see https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/websites-using-pkgdown-bookdown-and-blogdown.html   to set up.  The GitHub action doesn?t use Rstudio?s check but does automatically update the documentation when the master branch is pushed to GitHub.

An example is at https://merliseclyde.github.io/BAS/index.html. (package is at  https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS  ).  One that is a work in progress is https://merliseclyde.github.io/bark - which was built from the start using the approach documented above  - there is less customization there.

I do use pkgdown::build_site() in RStudio to preview the package documentation locally as well.

For documentation I did migrate to using roxygen2 several years ago from writing my own Rd files.   I like the checks that it keeps the documentation in sync with changes in the function.   The R Packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan has a nice chapter on this https://r-pkgs.org/man.html

HTH,
Merlise

 How to build *-package description from *-package.R

Regarding 'pkgdown', can't you just use the default directory , docs/, that pkgdown populates? When you push to your repository, github will automatically regenerate the pkgdown website (for this to work, you need to go to the settings on your github repo and activate building the website). 

As to documentation, go to the github site of pkgdown and start from there. To customise the site, you can add an yaml file, as documented in pkgdown. 

I am not sure why you wish to use DIY directory for the site generated by pkgdown. When you run build_site(), pkgdown builds it and opens it in a browser by default. Also, it only rebuilds the pages that have changed since the previous built. So, it is useful also during development. I don't remember at the moment if you could even set it up to watch for changes in the package and rebuild the site behind the scene.

I tried once before, a few years ago and failed to show the perseverance to succeed.  With help from so many wonderful tools so many people have created, and working in Rstudio, I do now have a package with some functions that work and a bit of function documentation.

I am starting to understand documenting functions using the Code, Document in Rstudio and seem to have found good examples and documentation for that.  However, I am failing to find similar information about creating the CECPfuns-package documentation I would like to build.  I have a CECPfuns-package.R that I think I created with a packaged function that generates that skeleton (embarrassingly, I have forgotten now what that was).   I think that created my CECPfuns-package.Rd so I do have a vestigial answer to CECPfuns-package.  I also have a CECPfuns-package.Rd file generated with utils::promptPackage but I have left this in my package root directory (against the warning note) as it looks as if people recommend creating package documentation from *-package.R files in the R directory and I guess I'd prefer not to have to learn .Rd syntax if I can stick with working from R (or Rmd?).  I did

I would really like to find advice on how to build CECPfuns-package docucmentation from that file or I'd love it if someone has created package documentation from a *-package.R file they'd be willing to share with me.

There are two general approaches for writing help pages in R.

The older approach (that I use) is to use functions like prompt() and
promptPackage() to create skeletons of documentation in the man directory, then edit them by hand.  The main disadvantage of this approach is that the Rd format is pretty ugly:  it's kind of like LaTeX, but different enough that even if you know LaTeX, you'll have to spend some time learning it.  It's also a bit of a pain to keep your documentation in sync with your source code:  when you change the arguments to a function, you don't get automatic changes to the help page.

RStudio has pretty good support for this approach, in that you can preview the pages as you work on them, it knows a bit about their syntax so things are highlighted nicely, and there are easy methods to jump from a function to the corresponding .Rd file.

To set this up you uncheck the "Generate documentation with ROxygen" 
option in the project build tools options.  That's it!

The approach that a lot of newer packages use is to generate the .Rd files from comments in the .R files using Roxygen2.  In recent versions of Roxygen2, what you type can be entered in Markdown instead of Rd format.  Some parts of the Rd file will be generated automatically, so you don't need to type them at all:  that's another advantage.

What I don't like about this approach is:

  - Mixing source code and documentation makes your source files bigger which discourages careful documentation and makes it harder to read the code.  Source and docs are different things, so in my opinion, they shouldn't be mixed in the same file.

  - I don't think RStudio supports a "Preview" for the help page for a function (but I might be wrong about this, since I don't use it much).

On the other hand, it's definitely quicker to learn and to get minimal documentation out of the Roxygen approach.

In my opinion, what would be ideal is to have separate files for source and docs, with a less ugly format for the docs, and some kind of automatic link between source and doc files so updates to one are reflected in the other (or at least differences are signalled).


> Q2: I think I have realised that the html structure for packages that I'm so used to on CRAN isn't built by default when you build a package and I think the process may be automated by the pkgDown package and I've tried that putting the output (again, against the warning note) into tempDir below my package root.  Again, though the documentation for pkgDown seem clear on the functions it seems (to me) thin on exactly what is being done and how, assuming it's possible, to elaborate on the html that generates, I am failing to find more on those topics.

I don't use pkgDown, so can't comment on these questions.

Please note that most rooygen2 users don't call the overview file 'pkgname-package' but just 'pkgname'. 
Also, these days people mostly use README.md for approximately that purpose and put a very minimal statement in pkgname-package or equivalent.

Apologies, I think that was clear.   

Do you or anyone else have an example of a ****-package.R that Rstudio's check has built into a package documentation file that was well populated and useful?

I think that's the key exemplar I am seeking and I'm finding it hard to craft any web search that finds me such a thing.

Any offer?!  TIA,

You can switch to backticks to not depend on bash so this

It didn't work for me, but I gave up on that approach pretty quickly so 
I might have made some other error that caused the failure.

Greetings,

I submitted my package CDatanet.
There was no error from Windows and Debian but just this note : "checking

However, the package did not pass the incoming checks. My understanding was
that this note is normal and does not matter.
Here is the message I got from CRAN.

automatically, please see the following pre-tests:

Please fix all problems and resubmit a fixed version via the webform.


Please, could you help me to solve this issue?

   That's weird, I agree that there don't seem to be any issues here for 
you to deal with.  I would write back to CRAN (at whatever e-mail 
address is suggested for correspondence, cran at r-project.org if you can't 
figure it out) and ask for clarification  (presumably the e-mail didn't 
list any other issues they wanted you to fix? Sometimes there are issues 
that are on CRAN's checklist that are *not* tested automatically ...)

To the best of my knowledge,  new submissions always get that note,  and new submissions are handled differently, as they are given closer inspection by a human, and since this is all-volunteer the amount of time that can take for the code review can vary greatly.  If you are greatly concerned there is something more than that.  you can respond to the email querying if the only problem is the new submission and you should just sit tight,  or if there is something else.  Again,  since it is a few individuals it may take a couple of days to receive a response.  You can also check the status of your submission both at:

https://itsalocke.com/cransays/articles/dashboard

and

 ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/.

If all is going correctly your package should be in the "inspect" folding pending review.

HTH,

You should be reporting everything, the key issue here was

Check: Overall checktime, Result: NOTE
   Overall checktime 23 min > 10 min


which is mainly from the vignette.
Please reduce its check time by using
- few iterations
- toy data
- and if that is not quick enough, try to provide precomputed results.

CAN can also disable vignette checks for regular checks of a package, 
but that should always be the last option.

Hello,

There is an error for R package mpath:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_mpath.html

However, the information related to the error is not very helpful for me to fix the error:

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64/mpath-00check.html


On the other hand, The same package seems to be ok on R Under development (unstable). I guess this is different from the platform where the error occurred in CRAN.

https://win-builder.r-project.org/Y272HSJc0X4T/00check.log

Any idea how to fix the error?

Many thanks,

Zhu

It looks like some sort of transient problem on the test machine.  I'd 
ignore it unless you're submitting an update.  In that case, I'd comment 
on it in your submission comment, saying you haven't fixed one problem 
because it was not reproducible.

Indeed, you can ignore it. It will very likely go sway in the next 
regualar check run.

Hi Team,
I uploaded a package in CRAN and it failed with the attached error.
My question:

  1.  Windows:

Error: Ld:/Compiler/gcc-4.9.3/local330/lib -LD:/RCompile/recent/R/bin/i386 -lR
clidriver/bin/db2app64.dll: file not recognized: file format not recognized

Why is db2app64.dll a non recognized file? What is the problem exactly if  someone can explain please.



  1.  Debian:

Error: ** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location

Error: package or namespace load failed for 'RIBMDB' in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):

 unable to load shared object '/srv/hornik/tmp/CRAN/RIBMDB.Rcheck/00LOCK-RIBMDB/00new/RIBMDB/libs/RIBMDB.so':

  libdb2.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Error: loading failed

Execution halted

ERROR: loading failed



Not sure why this error comes even though the file libdb2.so.1 is present in "clidriver" folder. Can someone please let me know how to fix this?


Thanks & Regards,
Binit Kumar

Message-ID: <CALnEB15wn=0r5ZcndnTo56hWxYM-LtZQVyKTnY1b+tDs-Bw_Zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
My R package submission got rejected today because of the URL libcurl error
code 35 issue below (see heading Attempt 1). It seems I have a subscription
to these errors, because I have been getting them a lot through the years.
Next, I edited the URL and submitted the package to R-devel on
win-builder.r-project.org, but there it got flagged again. I am struggling
to resolve this. Please find below an overview of all my attempts so far..
Could anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?
Thanks, Vincent

Attempt 1: Warning after CRAN submission

Flavor: r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64 Check: CRAN incoming feasibility,
Result: NOTE Maintainer: 'Vincent T van Hees <v.vanhees at accelting.com>'
Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs: URL:
https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jmpb/2/3/article-p188.xml
From: inst/doc/GGIR.html Status: Error Message: libcurl error code 35:
schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE
(0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is
received (e.g. handshake failed).

Attemp 2: This is what I submitted to win-builder R-devel. In comparison to
the CRAN submission this has the doi URL instead of the full journal URL.:

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs: URL:
https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2018-0063 From: inst/doc/GGIR.html Status:
Error Message: libcurl error code 35: schannel: next
InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This
error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake
failed).

Attempt 3:
Putting a URLencode() statement around the URL was suggested somewhere, e.g.
[link](URLencode("https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2018-0063")),  but this
breaks the URL on my local machine.

Attempt 4: Curl test (in Ubuntu with curl version 7.68) for the journal url
to see whether this provides any insight:

 state
Message-ID: <CAD6tx96J8vwapstbyYqtSYMq8iszLBPQ5iSAdmDGTKgVaE4u8w@mail.gmail.com>

In particular the magrittr package seems to be broken on the pre-test
machine.

I submitted a new version of the pkgload package on Friday, again on
Tuesday and today (Wednesday). All passed fine on the Debian machine, but
failed during installation on the Windows builder.

The failure is due to a soft load time dependency on testthat, which itself
has a hard dependency on magrittr. Because the magrittr installation is
broken my package (pkgload) fails to install. e.g.

* installing *source* package 'pkgload' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** inst
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
** help
*** installing help indices
** building package indices
** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
*** arch - i386
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'pkgload':
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'pkgload', details:
  call: loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()),
versionCheck = vI[[j]])
  error: there is no package called 'magrittr'
Error: loading failed

Error: package or namespace load failed for 'pkgload':

ERROR: loading failed for 'i386', 'x64'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/pkgload'


I am pretty confident there is nothing wrong in the pkgload package that is
causing this. The checks pass fine on a local windows machine. Hopefully
this will be cleared up by the CRAN maintainers soon.

I suspect that this is an issue with the CRAN Windows machine, not
with your package.

If you want to work around it in the incoming checks, you can remove
the URL. Maybe it is enough to remove the `https://` from the
beginning, but I am not sure.

Sorry, you can ignore my question:
Uwe Liges clarified to me that the other error in my CRAN submission check
is definitely a problem I need to address.
And from this post by Hadley on Twitter I conclude that the URL warning can
be ignored: https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1358170607314235392

Hi Ibon,

It looks like you have a couple non-ASCII characters in your documentation files. You can find which ones by running the command showNonASCIIfile in the tools package.

To address these warnings, you have two options:

  1.  Replace these non-ASCII characters with similar/equivalent ASCII ones.
  2.  Specify the encoding for the doc files; see this section of WRE: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Encoding

Best,

Max Turgeon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to R CMD build / check using LTO
Message-ID: <b748aee9-aa3f-31ff-7d20-ef34ba6bb8c1@posteo.de>

Dear Team,

My package 'LWFBrook90R' (https://github.com/pschmidtwalter/LWFBrook90R) 
was recently released on CRAN, but there are additional LTO Issues 
(https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/LTO/LWFBrook90R.out) with the 
compiled code, that need to be fixed soon.

I would like to reproduce the LTO warnings locally to see if possible 
solutions fix them, but dont know how to build and check with LTO. I am 
a newbie on Ubuntu 18.04 and hope to get help in this case.

There is information provided on how to configure R to reproduce the 
test (https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/LTO/README.txt), but I simply 
don't know how to "build with configure --enable-lto" and I also can't 
find the "config.site" file on my system to enable the respective 
compiler flags (see below).

Any help is appreciated!

Paul

---

LTO-Readme.txt:

Compilation logs for CRAN packages using x86_64 Fedora 32 Linux
(currently using GCC 10.1)built with configure --enable-lto and 
config.site:

CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -mtune=native"
FFLAGS="-g -O2 -mtune=native -Wall -pedantic"
CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -mtune=native -Wno-ignored-attributes 
-Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-parentheses"
AR=gcc-ar
RANLIB=gcc-ranlib

Look for [-Wlto-type-mismatch] warnings.? In some cases these involve
Fortran CHARACTER arguments where the length is passed as a 'hidden'
argument at the end, giving mismatches such as

sblas.f:3951:14: note: type ?long int? should match type ?void?

To work around these, define USE_FC_LEN_T and include Rconfig.h
(perhaps via R.h) before including BLAS.h or Lapack.h or your own
C proptypes for Fortran functions.? Then amend the actual calls to include
character length arguments: see the example of 
src/library/stats/src/rWishart.c

in the R sources.

The package is being built for i386 (32-bit) subarchitecture, but the
64-bit dll is being linked to it. I think that the correct way to
identify the target sub-architecture is to inspect the R_ARCH
environment variable from configure.win (in R code, use getenv()).

This is described in WRE 1.2:
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup>.

The bigger problem is trying to manually write under R.home() during
installation. This is not allowed by the CRAN policy and may lead to
problems. (Imagine what would happen if two different packages tried to
write to file.path(R.home(), 'clidriver') and for some reason succeeded
despite it's usually not writable for the end-user on Unix-alikes...)

Instead, you could try to (1) use ./configure to extract the
library to src/ and link to it from there and (2) provide a
src/install.libs.R file to copy libdb2.so from src/ to the same
directory where the package shared object is installed. This still may
be insufficient as you might have to instruct the dynamic linker to look
for libdb2.so in the same directory when the package shared object is
loaded by R; on some compilers this may be done by passing the
-rpath='$ORIGIN' argument to the linker, but this is very
platform-dependent (no idea whether it's going to work on Solaris, for
example).

See WRE 1.1.5 for more info on install.libs.R:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Package-subdirectories

In short, linking an R package to a binary dependency not provided by a
system package is painful, but not explicitly prohibited by CRAN policy
("Source packages may not contain any form of binary executable code",
and yours downloads binaries when it's built, but doesn't contain any;
"Downloads of additional software <...> as part of package installation
<...> should only use secure download mechanisms", which yours does).

Ivan

"R Installation and Administration"
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html>
contains a detailed set of instructions on how to compile R, including
section 2.7.4 about the use of LTO. Start with Appendix A, which lists
the packages you would need to install on your Ubuntu (basically,
build-essential, gfortran and the libraries mentioned there). Good luck!

You can use this Docker container:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rhub/debian-gcc-devel-lto

It is somewhat old, but chances are that it will reproduce the LTO
issues. I'll update it in a minute, anyway.

I suspect your problem is that, at least with the recent gnu
compilers, the Fortran 'c_logical' maps to the C _Bool, not the C int.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Cannot reproduce CRAN error (Solaris i386)
Message-ID: <CAAd_GN7z3Mt-Dhm7XA5TouU5YGuCej=dZvYKX6UfAxQFcxmNuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a package on CRAN called 'metapack' and received a message from
Professor Ripley that the error must be resolved for the package to be
safely retained in CRAN. I've encountered this error on R-CMD-check on
GitHub but cannot replicate it on any of my local machines to save my life.
The reproducible code snippet is as follows (I use Rcpp/RcppArmadillo):

library(metapack)
data("cholesterol")
Outcome <- model.matrix(~ pldlc + phdlc + ptg, data = cholesterol)
SD <- model.matrix(~ sdldl + sdhdl + sdtg, data = cholesterol)
Trial <- cholesterol$Trial
Treat <- cholesterol$trt
Npt <- cholesterol$Npt
XCovariate <- model.matrix(~ 0 + bldlc + bhdlc + btg + age + durat +
white + male + dm, data = cholesterol)
WCovariate <- model.matrix(~ trt, data = cholesterol)

fmodel <- 1
set.seed(2797542)
fit <- bayes.parobs(Outcome, SD, XCovariate, WCovariate, Treat, Trial,
  Npt, fmodel, mcmc = list(ndiscard = 1, nskip = 1, nkeep = 1),
  scale_x = TRUE, group = cholesterol$onstat, verbose = FALSE)

which gives me the following error:

warning: chol(): given matrix is not symmetric  error: chol():
decomposition failed

This can't be true because (1) it runs without problem on other machines,
(2) every matrix that is Cholesky-decomposed is ensured to be symmetric
through Sig = 0.5 * (Sig + Sig.t());. Even with Sig = arma::symmatu(Sig)
doesn't seem to guarantee symmetry.

Has anyone encountered something similar to this?
Thank you for your time.

Hi Ivan,
Thanks for the response. Appreciate.
But,

  1.  Windows: As I can see in the logs of the machine:

platform =  windows , arch =  x64 , R_Version =  R Under development (unstable) (2021-02-16 r80015)



So that means the architecture on CRAN machine is 64 bit and not 32 bit.

This is extracted by my code using:

platform = .Platform$OS.type

arch = .Platform$r_arch



The dll is selected based on the architecture, it is not hardcoded.

Please let me know if my understanding is wrong.

2)      Linux: I have already used "configure" and that copies the requisite file using "CLIDriver_installer.R" but problem is that R does everything in tmp file and then copy to the library folder of R. As you mentioned, "This still may
be insufficient as you might have to instruct the dynamic linker to look
for libdb2.so in the same directory when the package shared object is
loaded by R; on some compilers this may be done by passing the
-rpath='$ORIGIN' argument to the linker, but this is very
platform-dependent (no idea whether it's going to work on Solaris, for
example)."  So the part that is failing is loading. I want to exclude test loading using "-c -no-test-load". I tested in my local system and it works fine.

Can you suggest how to move ahead?



Also the CRAN upload has a limitation of 100MB. I have some executables for multiple platforms and they together constitute more than 100MB. How to resolve this? Can you please help?

Binit Kumar

The package is being built for i386 (32-bit) subarchitecture, but the
64-bit dll is being linked to it. I think that the correct way to
identify the target sub-architecture is to inspect the R_ARCH
environment variable from configure.win (in R code, use getenv()).

This is described in WRE 1.2:
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup>>.

The bigger problem is trying to manually write under R.home() during
installation. This is not allowed by the CRAN policy and may lead to
problems. (Imagine what would happen if two different packages tried to
write to file.path(R.home(), 'clidriver') and for some reason succeeded
despite it's usually not writable for the end-user on Unix-alikes...)

Instead, you could try to (1) use ./configure to extract the
library to src/ and link to it from there and (2) provide a
src/install.libs.R file to copy libdb2.so from src/ to the same
directory where the package shared object is installed. This still may
be insufficient as you might have to instruct the dynamic linker to look
for libdb2.so in the same directory when the package shared object is
loaded by R; on some compilers this may be done by passing the
-rpath='$ORIGIN' argument to the linker, but this is very
platform-dependent (no idea whether it's going to work on Solaris, for
example).

See WRE 1.1.5 for more info on install.libs.R:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Package-subdirectories<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Package-subdirectories>

In short, linking an R package to a binary dependency not provided by a
system package is painful, but not explicitly prohibited by CRAN policy
("Source packages may not contain any form of binary executable code",
and yours downloads binaries when it's built, but doesn't contain any;
"Downloads of additional software <...> as part of package installation
<...> should only use secure download mechanisms", which yours does).

FWIW this code does not give me any warnings or errors on Solaris and
R 4.0.4 and the current CRAN version of metapack.

Actually, I can reproduce it if I use the Oracle Studio compilers. You
can also reproduce it on R-hub like this:

rhub::check("metapack_0.1.0.tar.gz", platform = "solaris-x86-patched-ods")

I suggest you fix the valgrind issues first, because they might be
causing this crash as well.

You can also get a Solaris VM, to make it easier to debug the issue on
Solaris: https://github.com/r-hub/solarischeck/tree/master/packer Let
me know if you don't want to build the VM yourself, and I can give you
access to one.

We might need the help of someone else more knowledgeable of Windows
package build process, but here is what I noticed: configure.win calls
Rscript without any environment variables. WRE 1.2 says:

>> Using ?${R_HOME}/bin/R? rather than just ?R? is necessary in order
>> to use the correct version of R when running the script as part of R

It might be the case that configure.win ends up calling the wrong
Rscript and causing the problem. It might also be the case that
configure.win should handle both sub-architectures in one run. I'm not
sure. But the error definitely happens while building the package for
the 32-bit sub-architecture, because it says "*** arch - i386" earlier,
and the rest of the messages are consistent with this.

I think that the correct solution (as long as it's possible) would be
to specify a relative dependency load path when building the package
shared object to avoid hard-coding anything.

> Can you suggest how to move ahead?

1. Make ./configure put the dependency into src/
2. Add PKG_LIBS=-Wl,-rpath,'$$ORIGIN' (plus other flags) to
   src/Makevars.in
3. Use install.libs.R to make sure that both package shared object and
   its dependency are installed in the same directory supplied by R
   (that is, file.path(R_PACKAGE_DIR, paste0('libs', R_ARCH)))

This should cover GNU/Linux, Solaris and some BSDs. On macOS,
@loader_path seems to be the magic incantation to be used instead of
$ORIGIN. No idea about linkers on AIX and other platforms you might
prefer to support.

CRAN source packages aren't allowed to contain executable binaries
anyway, so your solution of downloading the dependencies at build time
from a secure location is as close to following the CRAN policy as it
gets.

Message-ID: <526f1815-fda7-4435-1e53-18a102f49f6f@krueger-family.de>

The following problem:

there are three packages foo1, foo2 and foo3 to use with the update of a 
package. The availability depends on the configuration of the host 
system. f.e java version

If I write in the Description

...
Suggests: foo1, foo2, foo3
....

inside of functions if have:

functionfoo <- function(data,usingpackage {
.....
foo1, foo2 and foo3
  if (usingpackage == "foo1") {
  do_something
}

.....

if (usingpackage == "foo2") {
  do_something
}
....
if (usingpackage == "foo3") {
  do_something
}

....
}

But of course it is not possible to get a positive check result.
It starts either with the missing package at suggest statement
or if I remove the suggest statement there is an error

I don't see your tests for the presence of the package you're using, but 
if you have those set up properly, the messages you get about some of 
your suggested packages not being available aren't going to matter, and 
you can suppress them using by having environment variable 
_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_ set to "FALSE".  If you are worried about a 
CRAN submission, explain to them in your submission message why they 
can't have all your suggested packages.

Hi Paul,

I think that changing the Fortran logicals to integers is the easiest
way to fix this up.

In the old days (1990's and maybe later), there were Fortran compilers
that did not map .TRUE. to 1 and .FALSE. to 0, but I suspect that R's
.Fortran does not cater to them.  I avoid Fortran logicals out of
habit.

Message-ID: <CAAd_GN60R8RA2KBv0pmiAz2SboOdWm_y4rfaXHgyQfUg0PJM+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm testing my package on winbuilder (devel) but somehow it's firing
this error message even though my package doesn't use vctrs package.
I see that vctrs is suggested by rmarkdown which is included as
suggested in my package (metapack) for vignette. I didn't have this
issue until yesterday but somehow it's giving me this weird error.

Is it possible that winbuilder has a broken vctrs package?

Thank you for your time.

Hi,

Let's say that pkgA uses pkgB::function1. Then, version 2 of pkgB
removes function1 and exports function2 for the same functionality. So
pkgA does something along these lines:

if (utils::packageVersion("pkgB") < 2) {
  pkgB::function1()
} else {
  pkgB::function2()
}

I'd say that there's nothing wrong with this code, and yet checks will
complain about "missing o unexported object" in pkgB, for either
function1 or function2 depending on the version of pkgB that is
available.

Isn't this a false positive? Or is there a better way of doing this?

Regards,

I'd agree it's a false positive, but I wouldn't expect the check code to 
be able to interpret the logic.

A better way could be to handle it in your NAMESPACE file.  For example, 
this is legal (if nonsense):

if (utils::packageVersion("rgl") < "0.99.0") {
	importFrom(rgl, bar = somethingNonexistent)
} else
	importFrom(rgl, bar = persp3d)


Now in the package you can refer to bar, and it'll be persp3d for a new 
version of rgl, somethingNonexistent for an old one.  You won't get a 
warning that somethingNonexistent doesn't exist as long as you're not on 
the old version of rgl.

Isn't this evaluated at install time? I think it is, and then you
would need to potentially reinstall the package when you update rgl,
which is not quite ideal, because it is easy to miss it, and then
you'll get runtime errors.

Yes, you're right, I didn't know that.  That's not as useful.

Hi,

I'm in the process of incorporating some improvements that I pulled from
github.
I am getting a warning and a note. These occur when I run

R CMD check --as-cran fftwtools_0.9-10.tar.gz

1.
* checking whether package ?fftwtools? can be installed ... WARNING
Found the following significant warnings:
  'config' variable 'CPP' is deprecated
See ?/home/karim/PWLisp/fftwtools.Rcheck/00install.out? for details.

In the .out file I have the following:

* installing *source* package ?fftwtools? ...
** using staged installation
'config' variable 'CPP' is deprecated
checking for gcc... gcc -std=gnu99


2.
Package has both ?src/Makevars.in? and ?src/Makevars?.
Installation with --no-configure' is unlikely to work.  If you intended
?src/Makevars? to be used on Windows, rename it to ?src/Makevars.win?
otherwise remove it.  If ?configure? created ?src/Makevars?, you need a
?cleanup? script.

I cannot find a Makevars file. I do have a Makevars.win file.

I would appreciate any help.

I was suggested: "A citation in the Description file is typically a good 
idea because people can think  whether your package is appropriate 
before reading all docs and installing the package, just from reading 
the CRAN overview page."

but I do not find hints how to implement the doi and the references in 
the DESCRIPTION file

Thank's in advance Knut

One way to avoid burying the conditional deep into the code is to put it in .onLoad(). When the author of a dependency informed me that from v.2.0.0  "as.polylist would be renamed I put the following in .onLoad():

.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname){
    if (utils::packageVersion("PolynomF") >= "2.0.0") {
        assign("as.polylist", PolynomF::as_polylist, envir = topenv())
    }
    ## add other renamed functions here

    NULL
}

This still raises a NOTE but is a change in a single place.

Yes, you're right, I didn't know that.  That's not as useful.

This works for a renamed function. But if the function also changes
arguments, it doesn't work anymore. The only alternative I can think
of is to getFromNamespace() to bypass the check. But it's hackish.

I would just do this:

if (utils::packageVersion("pkgB") < 2) {
  getExportedValue("pkgB", "function1")()
} else {
  getExportedValue("pkgB", "function2")()
}

I would think that the check is fine with this, although I haven't tried.

Indeed, didn't think about that. I forgot to mention also that the NOTE appears only with the old version of the dependency, so it disappears after a couple of years. 

FWIW, CRAN accepts a package with that note.

If you are submitting to CRAN, the relevant guidelines can be found in
the repository policies at
https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/policies.html:

> Citations in the ?Description? field of the DESCRIPTION file should be in author-year style, followed by a DOI or ISBN for published materials, or a URL otherwise. Preferably, the year and identifier would be enclosed, respectively, in parentheses and angle brackets. 


Example: Einstein et al. (1935) <doi:10.1103/PhysRev.47.777>.

What is the syntax if  I have multiple references f.e

You could be using a standard tool called 'autoconf'. There are some nice
tutorials out there. In essence it is used by calling 'autoconf' to turn a
'configure.ac' into a 'configure'.  The script 'configure' is then included
in package, executed by 'R CMD INSTALL ...' and friends and used to turn
'src/Makevars.in' into 'src/Makevars'.

| I would appreciate any help.

However, when I run 'autoconf' I

a) get the CPP warning (and we can likely remove the line from configure.ac)

b) worse, the resulting configure no longer works as the PKG_CHECK_MODULE
   use appears broken.

yet you do not need or use these as you have a _fixed_ src/Makevars. So no
need for configure.

I use these tools in my packages too. I can look into this later (maybe this
evening) and send you a pull request. Long story short you probably do not
even need autoconf, we can probably just use a shell script or Makefile
snippet to use

   edd at rob:~/git/fftwtools(master)$ pkg-config --cflags fftw3

   edd at rob:~/git/fftwtools(master)$ pkg-config --libs fftw3
   -lfftw3
   edd at rob:~/git/fftwtools(master)$ 

where on my Ubuntu system no -I is needed and no -L is needed either as
headers and shared library are in a common spot.  The difficulty generally is
dealing with non-standard situations. Outsourcing that to 'pkg-config' is one
option. You can also look at other packages using fftw3, for example CRAN
package 'fftw' that you depend upon too.  It _has_ what appears to be a
working configure.ac so you could read and study that and carry it over.
Note that it is a little longer than what you in your repo.

Hope this helps, Dirk

Glad to know you were able to solve the check problems!

Your package is currently waiting in the queue to be automatically
checked: you can see it in ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/pretest/

See https://lockedata.github.io/cransays/articles/dashboard.html for
more information on how CRAN seems to be working.

I see at the downloaded package that the urls are not usable by clicking.
means the doi  <doi:xyz/1234567> has not been converted to 
https://doi.org/xyz/1234567
Any chance to fix this in the description file?

I think you need to be more specific. Which "downloaded package"? Which
viewer? As the list info says: "We can't help if we don't know what the
problem is."

FWIW, this format is used by many packages that I have installed on my
machine and is rendered as a link on the CRAN package website, see
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colorspace, for example.

I can confirm that this format is not recognized in all HTML versions of
package descriptions out there, maybe most prominently at
https://rdrr.io/cran/colorspace/ and
https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/colorspace . The former does not even convert
full URLs in the description text (such as the R-Forge URL).

However, the lack of clickable DOIs seems to be a limitation of these
websites not of your package description or the CRAN policy. The
required <doi:10..../....> format is officially documented at
https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html#2.6.1

Finally, again citing the list info: "Please note that while
R-package-devel contributors will do their best to provide you accurate
and authoritative information, the final arbiters of CRAN submission is
the CRAN team." ;)

Best regards,

	Sebastian Meyer

Limitation:
The intention always was to provide links from the packages' CRAN pages. 
And that works.

We may work on the PDF versions.

Good idea. I have submitted a bug report for this at

https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18065

and will work on a patch when time permits and if not taken up by
someone else.

I have recently been having this same issue and traced it to a hang when
loading the tcltk package. The 'checking use of S3 registration' part of
the check loads all the base and recommended packages and for some reason
the tcltk package was hanging during loading on my machine (macOS 11.2.1).

I would try to load tcltk and see if this is the case for you, if so
removing and reinstalling XQuartz may fix the issue.

Hi Jim



*""">  if so removing and reinstalling XQuartz may fix the issue."""*

You might be onto something here. I did this last week, and haven't had the
issue since.

I never did find out what's going on fwiw.

XQuartz has offered users an upgrade from version 2.7.11 to 2.8.0.  The 
betas of the upgrade were causing anything X11 related to hang (rgl 
users reported it to me), and backing out to 2.7.11 didn't necessarily 
fix it.  I haven't tried the recently offered release candidate, but I 
would suspect it will cause trouble with any package compiled against 
2.7.11, as the macOS binaries on CRAN likely are.

If reinstalling 2.7.11 doesn't fix it, you may need to remove some 2.8.0 
leftovers, as described here:

Message-ID: <CAPcHnpQyFkRV0a5wmP+8YdernjRcUoeOXDA8gTbBFCFh-L5FVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I've been trying to translate some of my slow R code into C code, and I
need the complex math functions to be able to do this. I assumed I could
access them with

#include <R_ext/Complex.h>

but it seems as though that file only contains the definition of structure
Rcomplex. Any help accessing these functions would be greatly appreciated!

Complex arithmetic seems to be part of "src/main/complex.c" (all of main is
not exposed to developers).

Rcpp does have quite a bit (if not all?) of the complex math implemented
already though, so if you are not set on using C, you could instead work
with ComplexVectors in Rcpp (see the online documentation:
https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/html/namespaceRcpp_1_1internal.html#a7900c9d2c2c77396b9c0ad9340071c29).
If worse comes to worse and something you need isn't implemented, you could
check if it is implemented in std::complex.

... by using R CMD build --resave-data

But I *did* use that flag with my build command!!!  And yet "R CMD
check" seems to think that I didn't!

I have done "R CMD build --resave-data kanova"  (where "kanova" is
the name of the package in question), to make sure that I didn't
fumble-finger somewhere, but there's no change.  I always get that
NOTE.

How on earth can I track down what's going wrong?

There is only one file "stomata.rda" in kanova/data.  The
file was created using:

    save(stomata,file="stomata.rda",version=2)

The file stomata.rda is a *bit* on the large size; 285607 bytes
according to "ls -l", 279Kb according to the NOTE from R CMD check.
But that's not all that big, is it?  And anyway I *did* ask
R CMD build to re-save it!

When I load stomata.rda, object.size() says that stomata uses 1611312 bytes
of memory.

I'm running Ubuntu 20.04.2 and R version 4.0.4.

Has anyone else ever been confronted with this bizarre phenomenon?

Thanks for any tips.

cheers,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using the amsmath package in a vignette.
Message-ID: <20210304155128.429acbf7@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I am trying to create a vignette in a package (basically just using
LaTeX code; no R calculations or data are involved).

The LaTeX code involves the use of the align* environment from
the amsmath package.  When I try to run Sweave() on the *.Rnw file
I get a corresponding *.tex file, but then when I run pdflatex on
that file I get an error:

> ! LaTeX Error: Command \iint already defined.
>                Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.
> 
> See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.

>                                                   
> l.649 ...d{\iint}{\DOTSI\protect\MultiIntegral{2}}

which is completely opaque to me.

If I don't have \usepackage{amsmath} in the *.Rnw file, I get
(unsurprisingly) an error message to the effect that the align*
environment is undefined.

Is there any way to make use of amsmath facilities in a vignette?

Alternatively, is there any way to simply use the pdf output obtained
by processing an ordinary LaTeX file as a vignette?  I have done a
bit of web searching on this, but all of the hits that I get seem to be
substantially out of date.  They refer to putting vignettes in
/inst/doc and I'm pretty sure that this is no longer how it's done.
(But I find all of the vignette business rather bewildering and
confusing.)

Grateful for any advice.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

The R.rsp has a vignette engine for plain LaTeX sources. See
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R.rsp/vignettes/R_packages-LaTeX_vignettes.pdf
for how. It's straightforward. Maybe that helps.

As I read the docs (a few months ago though), you are supposed to include
the pdf and encouraged to include sources, but the process to get pdf from
source may depend on your private libraries/data/software, and is not
replicated on CRAN checks.  This seemed to work for me as my vignette
includes a less common .bst.  I sort of remember receiving errors about
missing .bst from rhub, but it definitely ran on CRAN with no red flags
raised.

Shouldn't be; the amsmath package defines \iint, and the error message 
says that it was already defined, probably in another package you have 
loaded. Easily found by googling. My first hit was

Absolutely, I am doing it with no problem. I have in one preamble


\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
% \VignetteIndexEntry{Parametric duration models}
\newcommand{\btheta}{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}}
\newcommand{\bbeta}{{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\beta}}}}
\newcommand{\bz}{\ensuremath{\mathbf{z}}}
and so forth

Have you read the "Writing R Extensions"? There 'inst/doc' is mentioned 
under 'Non-Sweave vignettes'.

Just to be sure: Are you running R CMD check on that freshly built
tarball or is devtools::check() involved?

- Does the R CMD build log actually show "re-saving image files" or
"re-saving sysdata.rda"?

- Have you set the BuildResaveData field in your DESCRIPTION file? This
would take precedence over the --resave-data command line switch.

- Have you tried running tools::resaveRdaFiles() on your source data
directory before building the package? Does that reduce the size of your
data files?

You'll get the NOTE when R CMD check finds that running
tools::resaveRdaFiles() on the data directory would reduce a file's size
by more than 10% with a different type of compression (if the original
size is >10KB).

Hope this helps.

Indeed. It looks admirably comprehensible, even to a Bear of Very Little
Brain, such as my very good self.  Haven't tried it yet, but it looks
like I'll be able to cope.  Thanks very much.

Well I guess it's not opaque when you are sufficiently comfortable with
what you are doing.  But when every <expletive deleted> thing is
bewilderingly arcane it is difficult to sift out the few simple things
that actually are comprehensible.

It turned out that I had \usepackage{wasysym} in the preamble.  I guess
it got there because I copied a prototype from somewhere ... long ago,
to use in another package that I maintain.  Then I copied the *.Rmw
file over from that other package and modified it, not changing those
things about which I hadn't a clue --- like wasysym.  I first
tried \usepackage[nointegrals]{wasysym} as suggested at the URL that
you pointed me to, and that worked fine.  Then I tried commenting
it out completely and that worked fine too.  So I never needed wasysym
in the first place.  But there are so *many* bits and pieces that it is
impossible to tell what is needed and what isn't.

<SNIP>

Anyhow, I seem to be good to go now.  Thanks.

cheers,

Rolf

Aaarrgghh.  Now you've got me worried again.  I'll give it a try,

Dunno what you mean by the "R CMD build log".  I could grepped
"re-saving" on all files and came up empty handed.

Never heard of that.  Tried it just now and it reduced the size from
285607 bytes to 161743 bytes.  That's substantial I guess.

Now that I have applied tools::resaveRdaFiles(), I no longer get
the NOTE from R CMD check.  So I guess my problem is solved.  Thanks.

But this still leaves the question:  Why the <expletive deleted> is
R CMD check telling me to use the flag --resave-data, when I *just did
that*???

I meant the standard output of R CMD build.
With --resave-data, it should show something like

* checking for empty or unneeded directories
* re-saving image files
* building '.....tar.gz'

Yes, indeed! I've investigated further and found that in R 4.0.0-4.0.4
the --resave-data option of R CMD build was ineffective for packages
using LazyData. This bug has recently been fixed in R-devel (c79573) and
I think the fix should also be ported to R-patched and appear in the NEWS.

Thank you for reporting!

Message-ID: <CACr7k5KNhm5v6Yrfz3DPTPA2u8vLCAtgToePagwsD-XjYa85tw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

devtools::check() gives me the following NOTE:

* Non-standard files/directories found at top level:
     ?README.Rmd? ?miclust.Rproj?

I get the same result with R CMD check --as-cran and R CMD check in a
terminal.

My .Rbuildignore includes both ^.*\.Rproj$ and ^README\.Rmd$.

I haven't had this issue when checking another package I recently and
successfully sent to CRAN, so I have no idea why I get that NOTE now.

I would appreciate any help to know why .Rbuildignore seems not to ignore
those files.

Thanks,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Warning for failed attempt to rebuild the vignette of
 the previous version of a package
Message-ID: <0624EB1F-687E-4967-8D82-F7DBE8018B13@utc.fr>

Hi,

I am trying to submit a revised version of a package to CRAN and for the second time it does not pass the incoming checks. I can?t figure out why.

The new version is numbered 2.0.0, the previous one was 1.1.0.

- The Windows report gives me one note:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Thierry Denoeux <tdenoeux at utc.fr <mailto:tdenoeux at utc.fr>>'

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  BPEC (15:41)
  Bootclus (14:77)
  CEVCLUS (13:41)
  NN (16:7)
These are just acronyms that can be easily removed. I don?t think it motivated the rejection.

- The Debian report has the same note and the following warning:

Current CRAN status: WARN: 1, OK: 11
See: <https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/checks/check_results_evclust.html <https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_evclust.html>>

Version: 1.1.0
Check: re-building of vignette outputs, Result: WARNING
  Error(s) in re-building vignettes:
    ...
  --- re-building ?Introduction.Rmd? using rmarkdown
  Quitting from lines 112-113 (Introduction.Rmd) 
  Error: processing vignette 'Introduction.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
  argument is of length zero
  --- failed re-building ?Introduction.Rmd?
  
  SUMMARY: processing the following file failed:
    ?Introduction.Rmd?
  
  Error: Vignette re-building failed.
  Execution halted
I don?t understand why the system is trying to rebuild the vignette of the previous version. It was built using Markdown, but in the new version I completely rewrote it using Sweave. The new vignette was rebuilt successfully, and there is no trace of the old vignette (the file ?Introduction.Rmd?) in the new version. 

Thanks for any tips.

Best regards,

Thierry Denoeux

The Debian check log appends the check status of the current CRAN
version just for comparison.
[
Indeed, these old problems are sometimes mistaken to cause a rejection
and I think it would help if there were a few more empty lines between
the new and the old check results and if the first two lines said
something like
For comparison, current CRAN status: ....
From: <https://CRAN....>
]

Maybe the problem with your submission simply is that the spell check
results hinder automatic processing of your package and you need to
reply to CRAN-submissions that these words are spelled correctly?

Otherwise I guess you may have overlooked another issue somewhere in the
check log. If you included a link to the pre-test results (or a copy of
the check logs) you will likely receive more sophisticated replies.

Are the files actually being included in the .tar.gz file produced by R 
CMD build?  This could be a bug in devtools::check.  If you're using 
RStudio, you can use the standard build and check functions by 
unchecking the box for "Use devtools package functions if available".

Don't run check against your development directory. Run it against the tar.gz file.

Dear Duncan and Jeff,

Yes, I see those files when tar xvf miclust_1.2.6.tar.gz.

As usual, I am both building and checking in a terminal (outside RStudio):

$ R CMD build miclust --resave-data
* checking for file ?miclust/DESCRIPTION? ... OK
* preparing ?miclust?:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts
* checking for empty or unneeded directories
* building ?miclust_1.2.6.tar.gz?
Warning: invalid uid value replaced by that for user 'nobody'
Warning: invalid gid value replaced by that for user 'nobody'

Then

$ R CMD check --as-cran miclust_1.2.6.tar.gz

If I move miclust.Rproj and README.Rmd outside the development directory,
then there is no problem, but I find that solution somewhat dirty. Any
ideas?

Thanks,

Jose Barrera

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Why .Rbuildignore doesn't ignore?

I don't have any strong suggestions.  Things I'd look for:

- is the .Rbuildignore filename spelled correctly?  It was in your 
message, but maybe there's something different in the actual file on 
disk.  Running file.exists(".Rbuildignore") should return TRUE if your 
working directory is the main package directory.

- is it encoded properly?  I don't know that this would cause trouble, 
but it might.  Run tools::showNonASCIIfile(".Rbuildignore")  to see if 
there are any non-ASCII chars in it.

- are the filename patterns entered correctly?  Spaces or punctuation 
before or after the patterns will be taken to be part of the pattern.
If your working directory is the top level package directory, this 
emulates the test R CMD build uses:

  files <- list.files()
  files[tools:::inRbuildignore(files, ".")]

It should list all the files that you want to ignore.

FYI, and in case others wonder or search for this later, the warnings:

Warning: invalid uid value replaced by that for user 'nobody'
Warning: invalid gid value replaced by that for user 'nobody'

are harmless and has nothing to do with your problem reported here.
It happens because on the system you're running your user account has
a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) that are > 32767, e.g.

$ id
uid=34002(alice) gid=34001(alicelab)

Since 'R CMD build' aims at building a *.tar.gz file that works also
only older systems with older tar software that only supports UID/GID
<= 32767, it created the *.tar.gz file with mockup UID=32767,
GID=32767 (called 'nobody') instead of your actual UID/GID.

Ta-da!!!  So I'm not going mad after all!!! :-)

Thanks very much for invetools::resaveRdaFiles(),stigating and
reassuring me.  Thanks also for pointing out the tools::resaveRdaFiles()
workaround which provided an interim fix for the problem.

I have now tried out building vignettes from plain LaTeX source,
following the admirably lucid instructions provided by Henrik Bengtsson
in:

 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R.rsp/vignettes/R_packages-LaTeX_vignettes.pdf

It all went unbelievably smoothly; no problems whatever.

I am deeply grateful to Henrik.

Dear Duncan,

.Rbuildignore is spelled correctly, and no non-ASCII characters in.

All tools:::inRbuildignore(list.files(), ".") were FALSE, so I decided to
rewrite .Rbuildignore from scratch, just in case there was any extra space.
I think that was the problem because now
tools:::inRbuildignore(list.files(), "." points to the files I want to be
ignored.

Many thanks,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using data.table in a package
Message-ID: <CAGAA5bdMW8BaEHEsdEi-o67wMWZJz=xUnu1Xz4cuOeH-Lz3RcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

  I am converting a couple of functions into a R-package. Many of the
functions use data.table.
  I have two questions using data.table in my own package.
  Normally I would put each question in separate emails but I think they
might be connected.

First question is short and I think the answer is yes.
1. Do I always need to prefix data.table each time I use something from
that package?
Eg. DT <- data.table::data.table(x=rep(c("b","a","c"),each=3), y=c(1,3,6),
v=1:9)

Second question is longer.
2.  In this small example code:
hello <- function() {
  DT <- data.table::data.table(x=rep(c("b","a","c"),each=3), y=c(1,3,6),
v=1:9)
  DT[, .(sum(v))]
}

I get these warnings from R CMD check:
hello: no visible global function definition for ?.?
hello: no visible binding for global variable ?v?
Undefined global functions or variables:
  . v

According to: vignette("datatable-importing", package = "data.table")
The solution is
hello <- function() {
  v <- NULL
  . <- NULL

And it works but looks a bit weird.
Is there a better solution?

Regards
Martin

No, you could import that function.  This is done in the NAMESPACE file. 
  If you're using roxygen2, you can put in comments that will write the 
appropriate lines to NAMESPACE.

The problem is that data.table is using non-standard evaluation. 
Syntactically it looks like it is referencing global variables, but in 
fact it is not, and you need to tell the testing code that what you are 
doing is okay.

The suggestion of assigning NULL to the variables is one way.  Another 
is to declare . and v as global variables using

  globalVariables(c(".", "v"))

outside of your function, and that will suppress warnings about them.

You could also put the NULL assignments outside the function and it 
would have the same effect.  (You don't want to export those variables, 
so be careful with your NAMESPACE file.)

Question one is a matter of personal preference. I personally stick to
explicitly state a double column depency with data.table.

Question two. Just replacing the dot by list is sufficient AFAIK.

Hope this helps

Martin,

Both questions are FAQs. Searches at e.g. StackOverflow might have lead you
to a solution (and you can search there, key is to add the tag i.e. make [r]
or [data.table] part of the search term).

The first one is a generic package programming question. You can use Imports:
in DESCRIPTION along with import() or importFrom() in NAMESPACE. Plenty of
tutorials.

The second one is more data.table specific and, per a quick glance, not
directly covered in the data.table FAQ---but it has a link to
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10527072/using-data-table-package-inside-my-own-package

It's a "tax" on package writing (that I grudgingly but happily) pay because
it makes the indexing operations _so much easier_ than data.frame use by
having non-standard evaluation just inside the [] operator as Duncan alluded
to. Which is, to me, another one of the quietly cool features in data.table.

Dirk

Thank you. Glad to hear it's useful.

This plain TeX/LaTeX vignette engine is implemented using base R.  If
someone is willing to drive the efforts, I think it's not too much
work to refactor it and propose it for base R itself, where I think it
belongs, e.g. in the 'utils' package where Sweave lives, or in 'tools'
where tools::texi2dvi() lives.  The vignette engine could be called
'utils::tex', e.g. %\VignetteEngine{utils::tex}.  To me it meets the
standards for reproducible documentation from source, although,
obviously there's no 'tangle':d code output.  If we want the latter,
we're getting into literate programming, and we already have several
vignette engines for that.

Just a thought,

Henrik

What is your reasoning for this?  As a former R Core member, I would say 
the reasons for something to be added to base R are:

  - it's generally useful
  - it doesn't have a lot of dependencies
  - it doesn't work as well in a contributed package

The first two conditions seem to be met, but what's wrong with leaving 
it in R.rsp? Would something in base R be simplified by having this there?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] testing for NaN in C++ code
Message-ID: <6c3ed6b9-bf33-9653-2544-7a46fa198a06@gmail.com>

I would like to test for NaN inside C++ code that lives inside a CRAN 
package.

Following the StackOverflow question linked below, I was using

#define isNAN(a)  (a!=a)

which I *think* used to work, but at some point along the way it stopped 
working due to compiler/flag changes. I'm thinking of switching to

#define isNAN(a) std::isnan(a)

instead. Does anyone have first-hand knowledge of having tried this and 
know if it works across the range of platforms/standard compilation 
flags that CRAN/R users are likely to experience?  Any other suggestions?

  I know that I should follow the problem upstream and detect it where 
it happens (see the answer titled "nan prevention" on SO), but in the 
meantime it would be nice to be able to do this robustly across all the 
platforms it's likely to see.

   cheers

It feels like this is about the third time in a decade+ I have seen you two
discuss the same issue.  Henrik advocates a fine technical solution from his
r.rsp package, you point out that there is benefit to keeping base R smaller,
and solutions in add-on packages.

All the while we all carry on and just slap the four or five lines onto the
file make it an Sweave vignette _without any executed code_ which works in
base R today as a proxy for pure LaTeX, just as it has for 25 or so years.

Or do as some of us do and follow Mark's trick [1] of including a pre-made
pdf inside an even more minimal Rnw file for the Sweave driver. Works great
with any pdf: pure LaTeX, LaTeX from (R)Markdown, ...

By "in base R" do you mean that one can do this *without* invoking
the R.rsp package?

What I understand you to be saying is that you can add four or five
lines to a *.tex file in your vignettes directory (or does the file
need to have a .Rnw extension?) and then the vignette will get built,
when you build the package, without any recourse to the R.rsp package.
(And there is then no need for any reference to R.rsp in your
DESCRIPTION file.)

Is this correct?

Can you be more explicit about the "four or five lines"?

If my understanding is correct, it would be nice to see this all set
out in simple terms in WRE.  Currently what is said in WRE is over my
head, and think would be over the heads of many of us ordinary mortals.

Here is concrete example of a minimal latex file (I had in /tmp from showing
a colleague newer to plain latex the effects of setting/not-setting \date{})
  
   \documentclass[12pt]{article}
   \author{Lennon and McCartney}
   \date{The Sixties}
   \title{Lots of stuff}

   \begin{document}
   \maketitle
   \end{document}

As you can see, no bells, no whistles, no limits. You could add whatever you
wanted.  Now as probably documented in several places, used in numerous
examples and many packages, _all it takes_ is adding four lines as a Sweave
vignette only needs the vignette headers:

   \documentclass[12pt]{article}
   \author{Lennon and McCartney}
   \date{The Sixties}
   \title{Lots of stuff}
   %\VignetteIndexEntry{Classics}
   %\VignetteKeywords{lennon, mccartney, harrison, starr}
   %\VignettePackage{musicology}
   %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
   
   \begin{document}
   \maketitle
   \end{document}
   
Just how you can 'pdflatex demo.tex' (if the former is saved as 'demo.tex')
you can 'sweave demo.Rnw' (if the latter is saved as 'demo.tex') where sweave
is the helper script below wrapping what would happen inside a package build.

And that's all there is. Give it a try. Should also work if thrown into a package.

Dirk

PS sweave script below. It's old and local... I should add xdg-open at the end.


#!/bin/bash -e

function errorexit () {
    echo "Error: $1"
    exit 1
}	

function filetest () {
    if [ ! -f $1 ]; then
       errorexit "File $1 not found"
    fi
    return 0
}
		       
	       
if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]; then
    errorexit "Need to specify argument file"
fi
			      
BASENAME=$(basename $1 .Rnw)
			   
RNWFILE=$BASENAME.Rnw
filetest $RNWFILE
echo "library(tools); Sweave(\"$RNWFILE\")" \
      | R --no-save --no-restore --slave

I don't really see it as a discussion.  I believe you that it's (at 
least) the third time I've repeated the point that base R inclusions 
need more justification than "I think it belongs there" (not only to 
Henrik), but I don't recall the discussion ever continuing beyond that.

Thanks Dirk.  Sorry for being so slow to express my thanks.
I've been, uh, distracted.  Have not yet tried out your demo;
I will shortly.

Thanks again.

I have no idea how that package perfoms the checks, but I guess you have 
an outdated version of lattice (or borken installtion of lattice) in 
another library of packages that is used for these checks?

Best,

Hi,

If you think this is a bug in rcmdcheck, then please report an issue
here: https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck/issues

My guess is that you have another version of lattice in another
library, and that version is used with `--as-cran`.

Yes, This was the problem. The recent version of lattice was in my home
folder ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0 (first element of .libPaths()).
An older version of lattice was in /usr/lib/R/library (last element of
.libPaths()).

install.packages("lattice", lib = "/usr/lib/R/library") solved the problem.

So it looks like rcmdcheck ignored the first element of .libPaths(). I'm
not sure if that is a bug of rcmdcheck. Shall I report an issue?

If you suspect that this behavior is different from running `R CMD check`
directly, then yes, please do.

I haven't followed all the code branches in tools:::.check_packages(),
but some of them use --vanilla when running the R subprocess that does
the checking.  I think that would mean that libraries in ~/R would not
be in the search path.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Unexpected problem with CRAN submission for
 dendroTools
Message-ID: <CACKka21Uvh1F968ASnTi4JVzjqWM1o0RLJuELTv9aHPSB-CjOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

Yesterday I successfully updated the dendroTools R package, but afterwards
I received an email from CRAN, regarding their policy:

?Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_dendroTools.html>.

Please correct before 2021-03-22 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

It seems we need to remind you of the CRAN policy:

'Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an
informative message if the resource is not available or has changed (and
not give a check warning nor error).'

This needs correction whether or not the resource recovers.

The CRAN Team?



After reading some online discussions, e.g. here (
https://community.rstudio.com/t/internet-resources-should-fail-gracefully/49199),
I informed myself about possible issues when examples rely on data from the
internet. However, all data that I use in my examples/vignettes is built in
the package, so I am confused what I should do?

Any advice is appreciated.

Jernej

Message-ID: <960a68cfd12df0b7ff8043f0792b8214c625e771.camel@math.aau.dk>

Dear all,

I'm seeking advice on how to submit a new package version with breaking
changes to CRAN. I will try to make this short:

1. spatstat (<= 1.65) had grow to be very large with extensive
examples, tests, and documentation.
2. CRAN asked us to reduce package size and check time.
3. We reorganized the package into a new umbrella package spatstat 2.0
which Depends/Imports several subpackages named spatstat.xxxx.
4. All subpackages are now on CRAN.
5. We submitted spatstat 2.0-1 which breaks 79 reverse dependencies
because they e.g. call functions that have been moved from spatstat to
spatstat.xxxx.
6. All maintainers have been warned over a period of months and offered
detailed help to adjust their package. Many have reported back that
they have a new version ready that will work with spatstat (>=2.0) and
are waiting to submit until it is on CRAN.
7. We received notification on 23 Feburary that "package spatstat_2.0-
1.tar.gz has been auto-processed. The auto-check found problems when
checking the first order strong reverse dependencies.
Please reply-all and explain: Is this expected or do you need to fix
anything in your package? If expected, have all maintainers of affected
packages been informed well in advance? Are there false positives in
our results?"
8. We replied to all on the same day, 23 Feb, that this was expected
and maintainers had been informed. Since then we have no news.

Any advice on how to cross the finish line and get spatstat 2.0-1 on
CRAN without putting too big a burden on the CRAN volunteers?

I can only come up with a long shot:

Ask package maintainers to submit their spatstat 2.0 compatible package
to CRAN with an additional line in DESCRIPTION:

Additional_repositories: https://spatstat.r-universe.dev

Since spatstat 2.0-1 is available from this repository they may pass
the incoming checks on CRAN, but my hopes are not too high.

If this was successful the reverse dependencies would be compatible
with spatstat 2.0 and on CRAN and so spatstat 2.0 would break nothing
and we could resubmit.

Best regards,
Ege

It may be too late to do this now, but you could use the approach that 
devtools used when it was broken up:  The main package imports functions 
from the new spatstat.xxxx packages and exports them.  This way it could 
be done with no breaking changes.  Reverse dependencies could change to 
depend on spatstat.xxxx at their leisure.

Hi everyone,

I am a beginner in developing R packages in CRAN. Now I am trying to submit my package to CRAN but I cannot solve this issue:


Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: CRAN incoming feasibility, Result: NOTE
  Maintainer: 'William Herrera-C?ceres <williamandresh at hotmail.com>'

Could someone give me a hand to rid that NOTE?

Thank you in advance,
William

   As far as I know, this is a harmless note and can be disregarded. 
(And, can't be eliminated.) (It would be nice if that were clearer in 
the documentation ... maybe it is and I just haven't checked lately ...)

I am building a package using R 4.0.4 on OS X 10.15.7.

In a terminal I type:

R CMD build --resave-data AirSensor

Then, I check with:

R CMD check --as-cran AirSensor_1.0.8.tar.gz

Everything is fine until I see:


* checking data for ASCII and uncompressed saves ... WARNING



  Note: significantly better compression could be obtained

        by using R CMD build --resave-data

I get the same WARNING if I submit to win-builder.R-project.org.

I've built many packages in the past and am currently stumped as to what
might be happening.

   Hmm, I may have written too quickly.  I find these lines from R CMD 
build --help confusing:


  --resave-data=        re-save data files as compactly as possible:
                         "no", "best", "gzip" (default)
   --resave-data         same as --resave-data=best

The first line suggests that gzip compression is the default.  The 
second suggests that "best" is the default.  And are we supposed to use 
quotation marks or not ... ?

   In any case, --resave-data=best and --resave-data="best" both seem 
worth a try.

This is a bug in R 4.0.0 - R 4.0.4 affecting packages using LazyData.

Two possible workarounds:

- Manually run tools::resaveRdaFiles() on your data directory before
building the package.

- Use a current development version of R (4.0.4-patched >= r80069 or
R-devel >= r79573)

Best regards,

	Sebastian Meyer

I had the same problem, and asked about it some time back (c. 4
March) and was informed by Sebastian Meyer that:

A temporary workaround (again, thanks to Sebastian Meyer) is to run

    tools::resaveRdaFiles()

on your data directory prior to building.

Dear Duncan,

Thanks for taking the time to read my message and for the constructive
idea. You are right that it is a bit late for us to do this now. Given
that spatstat (<=1.65) exports >2,500 objects which are now spread
across sub-packages we would obviously have to make a script to help us
reexport the functions and make documentation containing links to the
real man page. This might be doable, but one big downside is that we
then don't use this occasion to move package dependencies from spatstat
to the relevant spatstat.xxxx. If the packages don't fail I'm afraid
that a lot of maintainers wont change anything, and their package will
depend on the entire ensemble of spatstat packages rather than just the
relevant sub-package(s). For our usual end users this would also mean
that when they open the help file of given function after attaching
spatstat it will just contain a huge list of links to the real help
file they are looking for which is a nuisance.

Unless we get other really good suggestions we will wait a bit more on
a reply from CRAN (we sent a gentle reminder a week ago) and hopefully
learn what we should do differently to get the last bit in place.

Best regards,
Ege

One part of your first message that I don't understand is the reluctance 
of downstream package writers to update to the spatstat.xxxx versions.

You said "Many have reported back that they have a new version ready 
that will work with spatstat (>=2.0) and are waiting to submit until it 
is on CRAN."

Why wouldn't those new versions work already?  I'm guessing there is 
some incompatibility between the new spatstat.xxxx packages and the old 
spatstat 1.65 from before the split.  Can you describe what it is? 
Maybe there's a way to make the new packages compatible with the old 
one, so there would be no excuse for the downstream packages not to 
update right away.

Message-ID: <CALcKxsrLp-nXFZ5ZpWrMREWOfCjEPBbgZohRsPW=zJakn2XmRA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I checked (as cran) my package PartialNetwork
<https://github.com/ahoundetoungan/PartialNetwork> and I got this warning.

* checking compiled code ... WARNING
File ?PartialNetwork/libs/PartialNetwork.so?:
    Found ?__assert_fail?, possibly from ?assert? (C)
Object: ?RcppExports.o?

Compiled code should not call entry points which might terminate R nor
write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console, nor use Fortran I/O
nor system RNGs.

I am wondering if this is because I used Rprintf (line 147 in this file
<https://github.com/ahoundetoungan/PartialNetwork/blob/master/src/mcmcSARpl.cpp>)
and prgcpp.increment() (line 184 in this file
<https://github.com/ahoundetoungan/PartialNetwork/blob/master/src/mcmcSARpl.cpp>
) to show the progression of the program from C++ functions.
If this is the source of this  warning, how can I print from C++ functions
in the console? I thought that Rprintf and prgcpp.increment() are the best
ways to do it. I know that using cout and endl causes this warning but I do
not use them.

Thank you!

I cannot reproduce this. So this is most probably a local artifact
product of some local flag. E.g., _GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS, which is set by
default in Fedora, is known to cause this kind of warning. Therefore
it is probably safe to send your package to CRAN.

To be sure, my suggestion is to use the rhub service to check your
package [1]. Settings there will probably be quite similar to CRAN.
And winbuilder, of course [2].

On the other hand, I see that your package takes *forever* to check.
That *is* a problem for a CRAN submission. You should try to
drastically reduce checking time, possibly skipping non-essential
tests and examples on CRAN.
