Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Proofpoint and CRAN emails
Message-ID: <6462c026-81c8-43be-a66c-b8e110914b35@stanford.edu>

It appears that some recent updates to Proofpoint, which many 
organizations including Stanford use for scanning emails, has flagged 
emails from CRAN as spam. A recent press release from Proofpoint 
mentioning use of some AI agent doesn't exactly inspire confidence!

Our IT folks have opened a ticket with them and here's hoping that any 
fix propagates up the chain.

(We struggled with this for over a week while submitting package updates 
before stumbling on this silent menace.)

Just FYI.

1. I?m trying to upload my R package. However, I use the ape function seq_root2tip but for the sake of speed am calling it using .Call:

toroot<-.Call(seq_root2tip, nt$edge, length(nt$tip.label), nt$Nnode)

How do I get R to recognize the seq_root2tip function from ape in this C call? It is throwing up a NOTE that is getting my package rejected:

shade_branch: no visible binding for global variable ?seq_root2tip?

but seq_root2tip is a function, not a global variable.

2. I?m also getting a NOTE about: no visible global function definition for ?phy_tree<-?

I have declared phy_tree in the NAMESPACE file: importFrom(phyloseq,phy_tree)

I don?t know what the problem is?

Thanks!
Sharon

If ape doesn't export seq_root2tip, then you shouldn't use it.  Use 
whatever function ape exported.

In R, most functions are objects, there isn't really a distinction 
between variables and functions.

"phy_tree" and "phy_tree<-" are two different functions.  Import both of 
them (if both are exported).

1. all functions in R are variables. You can "trick" code tools by writing
seq_root2tip=NULL in the same scope but consider (a) C routines are
typically part of a package's private interface (b) it might be preferable
to use the string "seq_root2tip" with PACKAGE="ape"

2. phytree is not the same as phytree<- : importFrom(phyloseq, "phytree<-")
is what you want assuming it's exported)

(c.f. `x = phyteee(...)` vs. `phytree(x) <- ...`)

The problem is that the function that ape exports is way too slow. Using C directly really sped up my program, which is a bit slow even at that?

Thanks so much for the tips!

I think I?ve fixed #2. But I?m not sure what you mean by #1. Where should the "seq_root2tip" with PACKAGE="ape" go? In the NAMESPACE file? In the Description file? Somewhere in the code?

So sorry for not understanding!

Thanks!

Ah, ok great, thanks.

So I added:
toroot<-.Call(seq_root2tip, nt$edge, length(nt$tip.label), nt$Nnode, PACKAGE = 'ape')

But check() is still throwing up a note:

basic_branch: no visible binding for global variable ?seq_root2tip?
  shade_branch: no visible binding for global variable ?seq_root2tip?
  Undefined global functions or variables:
    seq_root2tip

Any thoughts?

You need to be collaborating with the ape maintainer to fix that package 
so it works for your problem.  Most package maintainers are happy to 
accept suggested improvements.

I think you can put it in quotes so then it won?t be an issue. Other wise
you can use the global variables function:

The ideal approach would be to try to understand why the exported

ape does actually export the variable seq_root2tip for use with
.Call() (see the info in ape::seq_root2tip).  So you can import it and
use is as seq_root2tip or use it as ape::seq_root2tip.

I believe the suggestion was that you should alternatively write:

.Call("seq_root2tip", nt$edge, length(nt$tip.label), nt$Nnode, PACKAGE = "ape")

however, that generates the following note that CRAN is very unlikely to accept:

* checking foreign function calls ... NOTE
Foreign function call to a different package:
  .Call("seq_root2tip", ..., PACKAGE = "ape")
See chapter 'System and foreign language interfaces' in the 'Writing R
Extensions' manual.

The other possibility is adding:

importFrom(ape, seq_root2tip)

to your NAMESPACE and not modifying your code, but that generates a
different note:

* checking foreign function calls ... NOTE
Registration problem:
  symbol 'seq_root2tip' not in namespace:
   .Call(seq_root2tip, ...)
See chapter 'System and foreign language interfaces' in the 'Writing R
Extensions' manual.

Your best bet is to ask the maintainers of package:ape to add and
export an R function like this:

idk <- function (...)
.Call(seq_root2tip, ...)

There are also ways to do it in C using R_RegisterCCallable and
R_GetCCallable but that might be too complicated for something like
this.

For the record, I changed the "Title" field in the DESCRIPTION file (and
made some other adjustments) and resubmitted the package.  The package
got uploaded to CRAN with startling rapidity!

Thanks Duncan.

So I think the only solution that CRAN will accept is linking against headers. I can download an ape.h header file, but for the life of me, I?m having trouble figuring out how to link it in my R package. I?ve read what I can find online, but haven?t been successful. Right now, I have the ape.h file in an src folder. I also have
LinkingTo: Rcpp, ape
In my DESCRIPTION file

But I?m getting all sorts of errors. Does anyone have an example of how I can do this that I might be able to work from?

Thanks in advance!!!!
Sharon

Sharon, Luke noted that (somewhat strangely [1]) {ape} is exporting the
registered entry point for that routine, so you should just be able to do:

importFrom(ape,seq_root2tip)

and be on your way.

[1] ?ape::seq_root2tip notes that "other packages" use it, but none of
those are on CRAN, could be a Bioconductor thing:

Dear All,

I submitted a new package ("ironseed") [1] to CRAN. I am not sure how
to address one feedback message or even what is causing it. It might
be related to Kevin Ushey's R scripts that I am using to configure the
package during installation [2]. The message that I received is below.

"""
Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your
examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace (including the
package directory and getwd()). This is not allowed by CRAN policies.
Please omit any default path in writing functions. In your
examples/vignettes/tests you can write to tempdir().
-> tools/config.Rtools/config/configure.R
"""

`tools/config.Rtools/config/configure.R` is not a file in my package.
So I assume that this report is saying that it is being created during
installation, but I can't reproduce it. My package does read and
execute `tools/config/configure.R` during installation, so right now
my guess is that my configure script is somehow creating
`tools/config.Rtools/config/configure.R` when I try to read
`tools/config/configure.R`. Any help figuring this out would be
appreciated.

I am not expert in this,  but I do notice that your .Rbuildignore is actually a link to a file of Kevin Ushey,  and I don?t know that CRAN will deal with that correctly.  Try instead to create a new .Rbuildignore with the same contents but is not  pointer but a file.

HTH,

Dear Roy,

I think you might have looked at the wrong file. My .Rbuildignore is
here https://github.com/reedacartwright/ironseed/blob/main/.Rbuildignore.

Thanks for looking,

Cheers.

Thanks.  I am old and slow and often overlook things,  but I don?t see the tools directory in that file that you are pointing to,  which would be consistent with the error message you are getting because that is where the file being name reside.  So you can either add that to the .Rbuildignore. or remove it if not needed.

HTH,

-Roy

I would like to add that copy pasting is also a valid way to include 
dependencies.

Just make sure to get contributions right.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Inconsistent application of the rule about modifying
 the user filespace?
Message-ID: <5a8e849f-4e21-4306-ac65-437ee0c0ed5a@protonmail.com>

Dear all,

tl;dr: several CRAN packages can modify the user filespace without 
explicitly
requiring the user to specify the path, but I was required to change the
default behavior of some functions in my package because they would 
modify the
user's filespace. This seems inconsistent to me (and therefore it's a bit
frustrating), is there a way to clarify it in the policies?

Longer version:

A couple of weeks ago, I submitted a package, flir [0], that provides
several functions that write to the user directory (it is now on CRAN). For
instance, `setup_flir()` creates a folder "flir" in the working 
directory, and
`fix()` parses all R files in the working directory and potentially 
modifies
them following a list of predefined rules. The behavior of those 
functions was
clearly documented.

Those functions had an argument `path = "."` by default. During the 
submission
process, I got a comment indicating that I had to remove this
default value and force users to specify a value for `path` instead (or
interactively handle it if it is missing), which is a bit annoying simply
because it forces extra typing. This comment was referring to the following
paragraph from CRAN policies:

"Packages should not write in the user?s home filespace (including
clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R
session?s temporary directory (or during installation in the location
pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should be cleaned up). Installing
into the system?s R installation (e.g., scripts to its bin directory) is
not allowed.
Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the package
obtains confirmation from the user."

I understand the willingness to minimize automatic changes to the user's
file system, but it seems to me that this rule is not consistently 
applied. There
are plenty of functions from external packages that directly write to 
the user's
file system without specifying a path and without obtaining confirmation 
from
the user, such as `altdoc::setup_docs(), `pkgdown::build_site()`,
`Rcpp::Rcpp.package.skeleton()`, `roxygen2::roxygenize()`, most of `usethis`
functions, etc.

Therefore, it's quite unclear to me why removing the default `path = 
"."` was
required in this case. Does this depend on who reviews the submissions? Is
there a way to clarify it in the policies?

Best,
Etienne

Proving a negative is hard.

My guess is that the reviewer may have used a static analysis tool to
look for calls to cat()/writeLines() or functions with a default
argument of ".". The "tools/config.Rtools/config/configure.R" may be a
typo or a forgotten separator somewhere.

If you made any changes to the package for the resubmission, put the
explanation about the R scripts under tools/ being required by the
configure script to operate on the current directory in the submission
comment.

If you want to be extra sure, you can try experimenting with a
container or a virtual machine:

find / /home /tmp -xdev -ls > .../ironseed.before
./configure
find / /home /tmp -xdev -ls > .../ironseed.after
diff -u .../ironseed.before .../ironseed.after

(Adjust the 'find' command so that it can visit all the relevant
filesystems, not /proc or /sys on Linux.)

I didn't notice anything amiss in my own limited testing.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Indicate dependency on kitty in DESCRIPTION
Message-ID: <d453b264-a092-4aeb-be8d-f4c360ad7d3f@eoos.dds.nl>


I have a package, which I am thinking to submit to CRAN. It can output 
graphics/plots to the kitty terminal (https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). 
However, I am not sure if and how I should indicate the dependency on 
kitty. The package builds and installs fine without kitty. However, you 
can't really use it without it (it will generate errors when you try).

Two possible fields in the DESCRIPTION could be:

SystemRequirements: kitty

And since, kitty only runs on macos and linux:

OS_type: unix

Should I add these? Like above?

Thanks!

Jan

I think the SystemRequirements field is enough.  *Your package* doesn't 
depend on unix, it just depends on kitty.

Hi Reed,

Have you received any feedback yet? My only guess is that this was a
false positive from some static analysis tools on the CRAN
maintainer's side;
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Package-subdirectories
says that:

> Subdirectory tools is the preferred place for auxiliary files needed during configuration, and also for sources need to re-create scripts (e.g. M4 files for autoconf: some prefer to put those in a subdirectory m4 of tools).

Perhaps the presence of these files within a CRAN package submission
is causing something to trip up. If not, let me know if there's
anything I can change on the 'configure' side to help resolve this.

Did you also get a warning about the 'cleanup.R' file? That is, my
guess is that the presence of these two files
(https://github.com/reedacartwright/ironseed/tree/main/tools/config)
is somehow causing the issue.

Thanks,
Kevin

Please ignore that comment:
I think "tools/config/configure.R" was meant, but that seems fine, too.

Hi Kevin,

First, thanks for the configure.R package. I needed to check for the
presence of two functions during compilation and it helped simplify
the process for me.

I resubmitted to CRAN yesterday under the assumption that this report
was being generated from a static analysis. I made the following
changes to `tools/config.R`.

* Removed all the `@export` lines.
* Removed the default `path = "."` in `configure_directory()`.
* Removed the `use_configure()` function.

You can see the fill diff at
<https://github.com/reedacartwright/ironseed/compare/8522d28...45a0f23#diff-6c174165097fa11900454663ab7b0a589bb0fc8f7e41b25d8b11833674ad4d91>

If this passes, I'll let you know.

Cheers,
Reed

OK. Thanks!

I wasn't sure if the 'SystemRequirements' field was intended just for 
dependencies needed for building and installing the package like 
libraries or a 'non-default C++ standard'. Or that it should also be 
used for dependencies needed at run-time.

Message-ID: <5b390b92-8fff-44a9-80d1-a948ec41c084@ens-lyon.fr>

Hi,

I am the maintainer of a package for which we have done a major 
refactoring (work in progress, can be found here 
<https://github.com/getkeops/keops/tree/fix_rkeops_v2_keops_v2.3/rkeops>).

Upon my last resubmission to CRAN, some issues regarding some man pages 
(that I obviously missed) were found, e.g. function doc without a 
\value{} tag, or examples for (purposely) unexported functions.

These issues were not raised during package check (with or without 
`--as-cran` flag).

The code base is quite large, and I would be very interested in any tool 
that could help me check the man pages more thoroughly than a package 
check ?

I know about `devtools::check_man()` but it does not find the issues 
that I am mentioning.

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

They also weren't found when checking on winbuilder 
(https://win-builder.r-project.org/)? Especially when checking with 
r-devel?

Hi Ghislain,

You may be interested in checkhelper::find_missing_tags().
More generally, there's a nice list of tools to prepare for CRAN submission here: https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prepare-for-cran

Best,
Etienne

Among other tests, CRAN uses the development version of R (R-devel) for 
checks.  It usually contains more stringent tests than the release 
version of R, so possibly you were using a release version for tests and 
that test wasn't in it.

The Github action r-lib/actions/check-r-package at v2 will run on R-devel 
if you specify "r: 'devel'".   For example in my rgl package checks 
(visible at 
https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl/blob/master/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml), 
I check on the release and the devel versions by having

       matrix:
         config:
           - {os: windows-latest, r: 'release'}
           - {os: windows-latest, r: 'devel'}
           - {os: ubuntu-latest,   r: 'devel', http-user-agent: 'release'}
           - {os: macos-latest, r: 'devel'}

Hi again,

Thanks for the responses!

@Jan van der Laan our package is unix-only so I did no try to check it 
with winbuilder.

@Etienne Bacher `checkhelper::find_missing_tags()` does actually find 
some issue, even running with the release version of R.

@Duncan Murdoch I was indeed running the check with the release version 
of R, I'll check with the development version.

Thanks again,

Best regards,

There are also regularly updated Docker containers if you want to run checks
locally rather than as an action. See for example rocker/drd (smaller) or
rocker/r-devel (larger).

Ghislain,

That email was unreadable for me in two different email clients.

A common pattern for resource minimalisation is to add a snippet setting the
resources in a way CRAN prefers at the beginning of each examples block,
often wrapped in a \dontshow{} block, and possibly resetting at end. That has
been discussed on this list before so some creative searching may lead you
there. 

Best, Dirk

tools::checkRdContents() et al. (see ?tools::QC), used by R CMD check, 
don't currently check help pages for these things. I suppose there would 
be too many false alarms so this is manually reviewed by the 
CRAN-submissions team.

Here is quick-and-dirty code that uses 'tools'-internal helper functions 
to find names of Rd files that might deserve a \value section -- given 
an installed PACKAGE (as a character string):

     ##PACKAGE <- "rkeops"
     functions <- lsf.str(envir = getNamespace(PACKAGE))
     tools::Rd_db(PACKAGE) |>
         Filter(f = function (rd) {
             sections <- tools:::RdTags(rd)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] ggsmc: failed check
Message-ID: <1D66BAD8-9D80-42B8-B29F-4BB166E18986@gmail.com>

Hi,

	My R package ggsmc has been removed from CRAN after a failed check (see here https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2025/2025-07-05_check_results_ggsmc.html).

	I have not been able to reproduce locally the error mentioned in the check. The check fails on a vignette. It suggests the vignette is building but just gets stuck on an animated histogram. Could if be that the issue is in the gganimate package?

	Does anyone have any recommendations on how I should proceed? I am not sure how to make sure I have fixed the error since I am not able to reproduce it. Could it have been a temporary issue with gganimate, and in this case should I just resubmit the package?

	Many thanks in advance,

	Richard

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] A way to prepend/append some code before/after

Hi again,

Thanks @Dirk for pointing the issue with the encoding of my original 
message (it cannot be read from the list archive either). I do not 
understand what could have been the problem since there was no issue 
with other mails sent to the list earlier on the same day in the same 
condition.  I am resending it below from my webmail instead of my 
mailer, hoping it will work better this time, and so that everyone can 
see my original message.

Regarding my issue, I did not know about the \dontshow tag, so I will 
use it. Thanks.

Hi,

We have a package that runs parallel computations (work in progress, can 
be found here 
https://github.com/getkeops/keops/tree/fix_rkeops_v2_keops_v2.3/rkeops).

The package deeply relies on a Python package through `reticulate` that 
itself interfaces OpenMP-based C++ code, which can thus run parallel 
computations.

Users of our package can control CPU resource usage thanks to a wrapper 
function around `RhpcBLASctl::omp_set_num_threads(n_core)` available in 
our package.

By default, OpenMP uses all available cores which is a bad practice for 
CRAN checks. It is recommended to only use 2 CPU cores for computation 
per CRAN policies (which is totally understandable).

For unit test run with `testthat`, we can use a `tests/testthat/setup.R` 
file to run any arbitrary code before running the tests, so I can setup 
a limit on CPU usage here.

For my Rmarkdown vignette build, I have a code chunk not included in the 
output document that setup a limit using our wrapper function.

However, regarding example run, is there a way to automatically setup 
some resource limit before running package examples, or to automatically 
run some code (i.e. add code at top of generated `<pkg>-Ex.R` file) 
before running all the examples?

If not, I will have to repeat the function call that setup limit before 
every examples in my package (around 70 exported functions in my 
package), which does not seems to be really optimal.

In the same spirit, generally my example run breaks because `reticulate` 
is not explicitly initialized (I am not facing this issue in interactive 
or standard script mode and I do not understand why), so I would need to 
run something like `reticulate::py_available(initialize = TRUE)` or 
`reticulate::py_config()` before running my examples (so to prepend this 
at the top of the generated example file).

Also, our package generate cache files in `tools::R_user_dir()` 
directory because it does JIT compilation (and the generated library 
files are cached for reuse). We have a function to clean them, so I 
would need to call this function after example runs so that these files 
are removed (again for CRAN check).

Note: at the moment I have \dontrun tags around almost all my examples 
to avoid all these issues, but it was highlighted in a recent CRAN 
submission that it should be reduced to a minimum if possible.

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

Yes, see <https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/issues/517>.

When gganimate:::draw_frames() tries to plot$scene$plot_frame(), an 
error happens

     Error in labs(!!!lapply(plot$plot$labels, function(label) { :
       could not find function "labs"

but that is caught and turned into a "Failed to plot frame" warning 
(that would be shown in the rendered vignette), so gganimate only fails 
later when it calls its gifski_renderer() with non-existent png files 
and that is the error we get to see in the build log.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Should I ignore a remote-check NOTE on 'Author field

Message-ID: <F0C43B36-B61D-4AB7-9A95-6B1FEA5A0FD4@dal.ca>

# BACKGROUND

I maintain the 'oce' package, and to avoid problems when I submit a new version, I do some remote tests using

* devtools::check_mac_release()
* devtools::check_win_release()
* devtools::check_win_devel()
* devtools::check_win_oldrelease() # problem

I found that the mac upload fails, but it doesn't state why, and I'll ignore that for now, assuming it to be a temporary problem.  My concern is with the last test, i.e. on system

R version 4.4.3 (2025-02-28 ucrt)

It produces one NOTE.  Looking into this, I see the following in the 00check.log file:

* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE
Author field differs from that derived from Authors at R
  Author:    'Dan Kelley [aut, cre] (ORCID: <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-5911>), Clark Richards [aut] (ORCID: <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7833-206X>), Chantelle Layton [ctb] (ORCID: <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3199-5763>, curl() coauthor), British Geological Survey [ctb, cph] (magnetic-field subroutine)'

This relates to the following lines in my DESCRIPTION file.

# QUESTION

This is a false positive. The Author: field in your source package has
the correct text (it says ORCID: <...>), but R-4.4.3 doesn't realise
that because it predates the change to how the Author: field is
formatted.

R-4.4.x:
person("Dan", "Kelley", comment = c(ORCID =
"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-5911"))
# [1] "Dan Kelley (<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-5911>)"

R-4.5.x:
person("Dan", "Kelley", comment = c(ORCID =
"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-5911"))
# [1] "Dan Kelley (ORCID: <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-5911>)"

Message-ID: <CAA42DG=jymV97xeV16aPU2ut+ENcZL22ZD8VRb9ftkVwif2G7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I recently noticed that my package {flightsbr}
<https://ipeagit.github.io/flightsbr/> has been removed from CRAN but I
never received any email or warning that the package would be removed. It
seems my package was removed because it imports the {parzer}
<https://docs.ropensci.org/parzer/> package that was also removed on July
1st. The authors of {parzer} told me they did not receive any messages or
warnings. What makes this a bit more puzzling, is that both packages were
passing all CRAN checks (see here
<https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2025/2025-07-02_check_results_flightsbr.html>
and
here
<https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2025/2025-07-02_check_results_parzer.html>
).

I'm wondering what has caused this and if this might have happened to other
packages.

Best wishes,

Rafa Pereira

While it is, indeed, not visible in the archived check results, digging
into src/contrib/PACKAGES.in reveals that 'parzer' failed the
UBSanitizer check on an Apple M1 machine on June 1st:

https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/M1-SAN/parzer/tests/testthat.Rout

Casting a NaN value to an integer is undefined behaviour (with de-facto
different results on x86_64 and ARM processors). There used to be a
check for 'x' being NA_real_, but it seems to have been broken during
refactoring three years ago:
https://github.com/ropensci/parzer/blame/10a8aa68bea8b18a69cc99326e949c5beb144afd/src/pz_parse_parts.cpp#L11-L21

Arguably, the check should be for isnan(x), not only R_IsNA(x): the
latter will still miss non-NA NaN values.

I think that the packages should have had a yellow deadline mark (i.e.
with(tools::CRAN_package_db(), Deadline[Package %in% c('parzer',
'flightsbr')]) should have been returning non-NA values) in the month
that passed. Having a number of packages archived due to a silent
problem with mail delivery is very unfortunate.

You got a message from Professor Ripley on June 18 with subject "CRAN

Uwe, I have checked my inbox and spam and could not find the email. I might
have deleted it by accident. In any case, thank you both for the
clarification. We'll be working to resubmit both packages to CRAN soon.

This came up on this list a few days ago, the way the ORCID field is being
formatted from the Authors at R entry changed in R 4.5.*: the previous R release
did not inject 'ORCID: '. But you can ignore this difference, it will not
hold up the processing of your package.

Well, ideally you simply build and check with R-release or even better 
R-devel.

Sorry for not being clearer. I checked on all three and it was only
oldrelease that was giving me this note.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] compact vignettes
Message-ID: <9E054EEA-E7BC-4D50-84CB-972B44AF2326@temple.edu>

I need some help on the compacting of pdf files in the inst/doc/ directory.
When I use the --compact-vignettes option, as in
  R CMD build --compact-vignettes microplot
the relevant pdf filesize drops 76 bytes.

The CRAN pretest makes it drop in size by 270 kilobytes

What incantation am I missing?

Thanks
Rich

I use `--compact-vignettes=both` (encoded in wrapper script `build.r` which
is part of my `littler` package).

One of those things that maybe should be a default but aren't...

This compiler error was apparently in a gcc update from last year, 
previously this would have been a warning. Apparently the gcc version in 
my wsl working environment was older and therefore I did not encounter 
it. I just removed the "const" and that fixed it (as it was const 
before, there shouldn't be a point where this variable is changed, so I 
guess it shouldn't cause any problems if I do not touch the Gecode 
library any further).

With this and some minor Makevars adjustments I got Gecode to compile 
both separately in the CRAN Debian testing container as well as in 
conjunction with R CMD "check".
Most remaining warnings are easy to deal with, however, one seems to be 
more problematic:


* checking for GNU extensions in Makefiles ... WARNING
Found the following file(s) containing GNU extensions:
 ? src/gcd/Makefile
 ? src/gcd/Makefile.in
 ? src/gecode_untouched/Makefile.in
Portable Makefiles do not use GNU extensions such as +=, :=, $(shell),
$(wildcard), ifeq ... endif, .NOTPARALLEL See section ?Writing portable
packages? in the ?Writing R Extensions? manual.


So there are definitely multiple occurences of such extensions in the 
Gecode Makefile. Since it is, unfortunately, quite extensive I would 
rather not have to rewrite too much of it (also because I do not really 
know too much about more advanced Makefiles). So the question would be 
how unportable it really is in its current state. I have compiled Gecode 
on multiple different Windows and Linux systems without too much hassle 
so far, which is why I wonder whether it is really all that bad (after 
all the library itself was written to run on Linux, Windows and MacOS).

Best regards,
Nils

I still don't have the incantation correct
When I use
echo $R_QPDF $R_GSCMD $GS_QUALITY
R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both microplot

I get   558910 bytes

When I use
R_QPDF=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/qpdf
R_GSCMD=/usr/local/bin/Cellar/ghostscript/10.03.0/bin/gs
GS_QUALITY=ebook
echo $R_QPDF $R_GSCMD $GS_QUALITY
R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both microplot

I get 558950 bytes

The bytecount for the package went up.

Unfortunately, this seems to be very dependent on versions of software
in use, including LaTeX and Ghostscript (and fonts?). I can compress
your pre-built 372Kb vignette to 96Kb (as does the CRAN machine), but
when I rebuild the package, I can only get down from 276Kb to 156Kb:

R -q -s -e '
 untar("microplot_1.0-47.tar.gz.orig");
 tools::compactPDF(
  "microplot/inst/doc",
  gs_cmd = "gs", gs_quality = "ebook",
  verbose = TRUE
 )
'
qs_quality="ebook" : use_gs=TRUE, use_qpdf=TRUE
#{pdf}s = length(paths) = 1
- microplot/inst/doc/rmhPoster.pdf:    gs: res=0;  + qpdf: res=0; 
    ==> (new=98115)/(old=380862) = 0.257613 =====> using it !!
  compacted ?rmhPoster.pdf? from 372Kb to 96Kb

And 'gs --version' says '10.00.0', which shouldn't be that different

Can you send me the 96Kb file?  I will then substitute it into microplot_1.0-47.tar.gz
and send that version to CRAN.

Thank you

I build ghostscript from sources under macOS and upgrade the version
periodically.  I encountered the same issue last year and stayed at
10.02 until they released 10.04, because there was a clear regression
in 10.03.  I was never able to track down a relevant bug report, but
I never looked very hard ...

By the way, as mentioned in WRE, you can get ghostscript from a full MacTeX
rather than Homebrew.  MacTex 2025 installs a binary ghostscript 10.04 under
/usr/local/bin.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Mega2R CRAN submission: false positive
Message-ID: <CH0PR04MB80512A61ABD3342BC64908B0D65EA@CH0PR04MB8051.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Last week I saw that someone requested help because expected e-mails from CRAN regarding an R package submission were not received.  I am afraid I may be in the same boat regarding trying to get our R package Mega2R fixed so it can be in CRAN again, as I received no response regarding my pointing out that the automated rejection of Mega2R is a false positive due to a compiler bug that is beyond my capability to fix.

I submitted Mega2R on July 14, 2025, and received an automated message that

package Mega2R_1.2.0.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically.

I responded as below that it was a false postive but did not receive any response after that.

--------------

I believe this rejection is a false positive due to a subtle compiler error.

In June, our Mega2R package was rejected due to a Warning that was generated during the CRAN checks. The Warning (which we are stilll seeing) was:

```
Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-special-gcc-san
Check: Post-processing issues found for gcc-san, Result: WARNING
   File: build_vignettes.log
   vendor/sqlite3/sqlite3.c:80239:14: runtime error: load of address
0x7faa31b1fa40 with insufficient space for an object of type 'struct
MemPage *'
```

As I explain below, I think this Warning is not due to any mistake in Mega2R code itself, but rather due to a compiler bug that is rarely encountered only under specific settings.  As such, I hope you will approve releasing Mega2R to CRAN based on the following due diligence investigations and findings:

Note that the Warning is generated by sqlite3 code so I opened a thread about it on the SQLite forum:

https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/e1015d1714

The conclusion of one investigation into this concludes that

"Because of the requirements to reproduce the issue, it looks like a compiler issue not a bug in SQLite"

Further checks of Mega2R

The Warning seen on the gcc-san test machine is not
reproducible on the other similar test machines. The warning is not reproducible on the other machines.

Further investigations via rhub

https://github.com/r-hub2/diplomatic-mole-Mega2R/actions

None of the checks on these machines reproduced the Warning seen on the gcc-san test machine:

clang-asan: All CRAN checks passed.

clang-ubsan: All CRAN checks passed.

valgrind: All CRAN checks passed.

m1-san (R-devel): The Warning seen on the CRAN gcc-san test machine was not observed.  However, there was an error involving `seqlevels<-` (which is also observed using R Under development (unstable) (2025-07-11 r88405)).  This is because the development version of `GenomeInfoDb` no longer contains the `seqlevels<-` function, which in the next release
will be moved into the Seqinfo package.  At that time, this Roxygen command

```
#' @importMethodsFrom GenomeInfoDb 'seqlevels<-'
```

will need to be updated.  For now, in the currently released versions of R such as R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13), this is correct code.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] `Warning in formals(fun) : argument is not a function`
Message-ID: <GV3P280MB0001D488C55C4047D0E73475F05EA@GV3P280MB0001.SWEP280.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I am looking for guidance on how to debug a CRAN warning for a package (rstpm2). The warning is:

`Warning in formals(fun) : argument is not a function`

I tried debugging this by using:

.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
    trace("formals", tracer = quote({
        cat(">>> formals called in R CMD check with object of class:", class(fun), "\n")
        print(sys.calls())
    }), print = FALSE)
}

At package installation, this showed that some formals() were called with objects of class derivedDefaultMethod -- however I am not certain _which_ objects cause this issue. (I realise that this suggests an issue with S3 versus S4 classes -- if that helps.) Does anyone have experience with debugging such warnings? Any guidance would be appreciated.

Sincerely, Mark.

https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=120837 suggests it's a
compiler bug; hopefully the issue will go away once the version of gcc
used on these CRAN check machines is updated.

Could you please provide some more information on where you encounter
it and how it may be reproduced? I don't see it mentioned at
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rstpm2.html>, nor
I see a recent incoming_pretest failure, but I do see some problems
regarding constants being overwritten at
<https://github.com/kalibera/cran-checks/tree/master/rcnst/results/rstpm2>.
It's not impossible that the root cause of this warning is the same
(although it's also plausible that it's different).

> At package installation, this showed that some formals() were called

I think this is a red herring: a derivedDefaultMethod is a function and
doesn't cause this warning by itself:

getClass('derivedDefaultMethod') |> new(\(foo=bar) baz) |> formals()
# $foo
# bar

> Does anyone have experience with debugging such warnings?

If you can reproduce the warning, try doing so with options(warn = 2,
error = recover) set.

Or when SQLite 3.51.0 comes out, containing the workaround for the
compiler bug, and RSQLite is released with the updated version of
SQLite.

At the very least, the RSQLite maintainer is aware of the problem:

Ivan: thank you for your reply.

I have now resolved this issue. I had an error with specifying an S4 implementation and its documentation. For debugging, I: (a) checked that a previous package version worked with a recent R development version; (b) used tools::codoc() to check the documentation (see the test-codoc task in $(RSRC)/tests/Makefile.common), using Ivan's suggested options() to recover from a warning; and (c) checked whether the S4 class had the available method.

Sincerely, Mark.

Could you please provide some more information on where you encounter
it and how it may be reproduced? I don't see it mentioned at
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rstpm2.html<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rstpm2.html>>, nor
I see a recent incoming_pretest failure, but I do see some problems
regarding constants being overwritten at
<https://github.com/kalibera/cran-checks/tree/master/rcnst/results/rstpm2<https://github.com/kalibera/cran-checks/tree/master/rcnst/results/rstpm2>>.
It's not impossible that the root cause of this warning is the same
(although it's also plausible that it's different).

> At package installation, this showed that some formals() were called
> with objects of class derivedDefaultMethod -- however I am not
> certain _which_ objects cause this issue.

I think this is a red herring: a derivedDefaultMethod is a function and
doesn't cause this warning by itself:

getClass('derivedDefaultMethod') |> new(\(foo=bar) baz) |> formals()
# $foo
# bar

> Does anyone have experience with debugging such warnings?

If you can reproduce the warning, try doing so with options(warn = 2,
error = recover) set.

Hi All,

When submitting a package to CRAN, I?m seeing a note for the installation CPU time being greater than the elapsed time. Normally I?d assume this would be due to some configuration running the compilation in parallel, but I haven?t set this in my package at all. Is this something that anyone has seen before and would know what to change?

Check result is here: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/boostmath_1.0.1_20250727_090857/specialChecks/gcc-san/package/00check.log

[ Aside: Interestingly that Windows check does not warn about excessive test time,
  whereas it does on my machine. I presume you opted to skip tests as CRAN to
  keep within their limit? ]

For tests and examples we know we are asked to over options(Ncpus) and alike;
I am not aware we can override a MAKEFLAGS="-j SOMELARGENUMBER" if it is set
so I am a little stunned.

The only thing that is different in your package is the use of UseLTO you now
added in this release.  If that this new in 1.0.1, maybe it is the difference
maker?  [ And I just validated it: removing that last line from DESCRIPTION
removes the compilation time NOTE. ] So that seems to be something you may
need to sort out with CRAN and their setup.

This must be the culprit. The 00install.out file [1] shows -flto=8 being
used, which GCC documentation [2] describes as "use 8 threads for LTO":

I think this was set in the Makeconf on the machine running the
"gcc-san" special checks; I don't see anything in the package that
would set 8 threads in particular. R itself, when configured with
--enable-lto, only sets -flto, not -flto=8.

That's good sleuthing, as usual. But note that my machine has no -flto=$N for
some N but rather '-flto=auto' which also results in the NOTE.

So an extra check may be needed to not issue the nag if LTO is used?

You're right, -flto=auto chooses the number of LTO processes
automatically if the Make jobserver is not available. Rven if I set
MAKEFLAGS=-j2 before running R CMD INSTALL, that information is not
propagated to g++, so it runs on all logical processors.

This could be the only way to make GCC use noticeably more than one
process by itself, I couldn't find anything else right now.

As a short-term solution, the "specialChecks" system operated by Prof.
Kurt Hornik can switch to -flto=2. For the more distant future, making
this message "INFO" instead of "NOTE" or possibly raising the limit
when LTO is used could make sense.

1) R has no native NTP client
2) outside NTP access is very often blocked on local networks (and local NTP relay requires configuration for which there is no standard)
3) it is overkill as we don?t need microsecond accuracy so a single HTTP(s) request is much easier

Message-ID: <CAOh2hrH+mFWwjWWaMzjCkobfUFpLHhm0Lb4RNEJcBto=08WLjA@mail.gmail.com>

One of my packages failed the noSuggests test, and needs to be
updated. Fair enough, a suggested package was used unconditionally
both in an example and in a test. From what I understood, a solution
is to wrap this part of the code inside
if (require("suggestedPackage")) {useSuggestedPackage}
However, it still fails the noSuggests test, this time because the
output does not match the test.Rout.save-file. This is also clear, as
some of the code is not executed, and some output is missing.

How do I get around this?
I could use ## IGNORE_RDIFF_BEGIN and ## IGNORE_RDIFF_END before and
after the if (require())  clause, but then this part would not be
tested when the suggested package is available either. I don't like
this solution, as it means the interaction between the two packages
will not be checked.

Am I missing something? Is there a different way of conditionally
using the suggested package? Or do I have to use the IGNORE_RDIFF
method?

Thanks,
Jon

Greg,

If the problem is in your local checks you can
add _R_CHECK_SYSTEM_CLOCK_=FALSE to your .Renviron to omit that check.
See R internals (which documents CRAN's default too) [1].

Best,

Llu?s

Correct! (requireNamespace(...) is also a good option if you don't
intend to use the package directly and are instead testing your
package's internal use of its optional dependency.)

There may be no good solution for "reference output" tests when some of
their dependencies are optional. Without bringing in a test framework,
I've only seen kludges, such as the test printing reference output when
the optional dependency is missing:

https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/8039a230b0ebbcc8ca9ea86e84d7c378e00b9d51/tests/knitr.R#L2-L3

I wouldn't call it a beautiful solution, but it does work.

To check the existence of a suggested package it is recommended to use
requireNamespace("suggested", quiet = TRUE). See the solution for
examples on the CRAN cookbook [1].

On tests, it depends on the approach you use.
It seems that you don't use any testing package for it (tinytest,
testthat, ...).
I think you could rely on the actual objects and not compare with a
saved output of tests.
Instead of:

> obj
[1] "test1"

Use something like in a plain R file:
stopifnot(identical(obj, "test1"))

This is how it is done on base R itself that checks if MASS is
installed and performs some checks conditionally.
See example on a mirror: [2].
Hope this helps,

To use *reference output* for optional tests, you could move these tests 
to a dedicated script with a corresponding .Rout.save file, put the 
files in a tests/ subdirectory, and use an .Rin file to include them 
only if the suggested package is available. I implemented a similar 
approach in the 'nlme' package to run extra tests with reference output 
conditionally on an environment variable, see 
<https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/nlme/tests/extras.Rin> for 
inspiration.

I would emphasize/paraphrase Ivan's point -- using goldens (.Rout.save) for
such tests is quite a headache. We do so for a very limited number of tests
in {data.table} (something like 10 tests of over 10,000).

You could instead change the tests of Suggests behavior to be based on
expectations, be that a framework like {testthat}/{RUnit}/{assertthat} or
just the built-in tooling like stopifnot(), where you just quit/skip the
checks when Suggests are unavailable.

Of course if you have a strong affinity for golden tests you can just split
things into multiple test files. If it is a huge pain to disentangle which
tests rely on Suggests behavior, that is a decent sign to me that maybe
that package is not Suggests after all.

Thank you for all answers!
I agree that adopting a testing framework would be a better approach
for future packages. However, as this particular package is not under
active development, I was particularly looking for solutions that
required less modifications of the current code.

And from the answers and the code in the MASS-example, it seems the
most straightforward fix in my particular case is to replace the print
statements with stopifnot(all.equal(...)). The suggested package
should in my case not produce different output than the original
package, it just offers a different way of computing the same result
when the two of them interact correctly. While I will not use the
.rout.save modification examples here, they could be useful for other
scenarios and for others who encounter this thread in the future.

Thanks and best wishes,
Jon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] My package CECPfuns on github has branches main and
 gh-pages badly out of synch
Message-ID: <72d70d90-cc4e-49b9-8ff4-bba8e0d5f8ab@psyctc.org>

Sorry for a very trivial issue at one edge of R package management: use 
of github.

My package (https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns) is mostly very simple 
as I am entirely self-taught as a statistics user and R programmer and 
as I am ageing! ? (I was a fairly good psychiatrist and psychotherapist 
and still am a pretty productive researcher I think!)

The package is mostly aimed at people like me who find R amazingly 
helpful but who sometimes struggle with the documentation, warnings and 
error messages. Hence a lot of it is trivial but is trying to wrap 
things up to give end users reasonable help, the odd vignette (not 
enough currently) and good input sanity checking and non-geek worded 
warnings and errors.

OK enough of the apologies.? I have always found git and github in the 
"dark arts" side of things but I thought that pushing my commits (from 
within a package worked on locally in Rstudio) was working for updating 
the package and mostly I thought the evidence was that it was.? Clearly 
I wasn't checking well enough.

At some point I clearly created a gh-pages branch and I think that was 
to get github to create the user friendly html page(s) about the 
package.? Reading the web now and trying to separate up to date from old 
advice from out of date advice I think this is no longer necessary and I 
could get the html from the main branch and ditch the gh-pages branch.

However, as the subject line says, I now see that the two branches are 
badly out of synch. Github says that main is my default branch and 
gh-pages an active branch and at the moment both say they were last 
updated six hours ago which was when I last pushed changes up.? However, 
gh-pages says its behind:ahead count is 100:31 which sounds nasty and I 
don't think my use of pkgdown and things in /doc and /docs are updating 
correctly.

Having scoured the web for help on this I am rattled and reaching out 
for hel. As I say above, I think using gh-pages is no longer necessary 
and I would like to synchronise the two branches if that is possible 
then delete the gh-pages branch and then get my courage up and try to 
get back to understanding how best to document things with github pages 
and with pkgdown.

I know this is very small beer against the fascinating things I read 
here but I hope someone can look at my mess and point me to safe ways 
forward.

Thanks in advance and more generally, thanks for the list which is, 
though often way beyond what I need, always educational for me.

Chris

Hey Chris,

Have a look at the actual list of commits in your gh-pages vs. main
branches, I suspect you'll spot what's going on pretty quickly :)

https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns/commits/gh-pages/

vs

https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns/commits/main/

Thanks very much.

Ouch, well clearly it would have been a help had I known to do that.? 
Got it and you are correct: whipping long quiescent neurons into action 
finally sorted this out.? It's edge or corner case stuff here I guess 
but may be useful to have in the archives for someone else some day.

What I had forgotten was that I had used the pkgdown package to invoke 
the gh-pages branch (done automatically I think which contributed to my 
forgetting it). That, with a CNAME entry in my DNS four years back, maps 
cpsyctc.github.io to https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/ (the URL is given to 
github via the first line of _pkgdown.yml). That means that github then 
magically does the pkgdown thing updating the gh-pages branch and that 
is then accessible at https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/.? As far as I can 
see, the ahead:behind count for the gh-pages branch in github is pretty 
meaningless here.? Someone please correct me if I am wrong about that.

What threw me off was another bit of forgetting: though I was updating 
the package version number in NEWS.md, I was forgetting to update it in 
DESCRIPTION so when I looked at https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/ I saw the 
old version number and thought the process wasn't working.

Solved!? I have added some notes, largely to myself to make up for 
crumbling memory, to my Rblog (https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/) at
https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/posts/2021-02-10-making-my-first-usable-package/#using-github-pages-and-pkgdown-to-create-a-page-about-the-package

Apologies for bandwidth and thanks again for the list,

Chris

Correct.

An aside: the gh-pages branch used to be the only way to publish at GitHub.
But for a few years now one can also use a directory (or even the root dir
and everything below it) in a repo. I prefer that and often use docs/.

It avoids the dance between branches. Other people prefer the seperation into
another branch. As always, each to their own, and good to have choices.

Simon,
I have been down a bit of a rabbit hole with this.  There is an interesting
APNIC blog entry related to this that tries to quantify the distribution of
clock skews.

1. I have a very simple R NTP client.  It does not implement the server
clock time adjustment process bits of the protocol, but at a point in time
its able to detect and discard unsynchronised servers and outlier
responses. You can have it if you want, but I think its the answer to the
wrong question.

3. The webservers that the check code references go down periodically, one
is unresponsive from here this afternoon.  I agree you don't need
microseconds or even tens of milliseconds, the check code allows for five
minutes of drift which is consistent with Kerberos tolerance of time
mismatches, but you do need "up" and "up" is not reliably there.  The www.
or cran.r-project.org servers respond to a GET with a standard HTTP Date
header that contains that server's current idea of what the time is (you
can see it using curlGetHeaders("http://cran.r-project.org"), the timezone
is required by the HTTP standard to always be GMT/UTC) and I assume the
core team have some level of control over those servers' configurations and
should be easily able to ensure time synchronisation with some sufficiently
reliable time source if that time sync is not already in place.  I suspect
that cran.r-project.org  is more reliable than the websites you are using
as time sources.

Wouldn't it be possible to use an r-project server, as described above, as
a time source?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Testing package on R-devel in a docker container
Message-ID: <CAMMJQ0Z1vq-e4R16AR_EJuVCKUQsXVXGFZHtbNS7Je1QdKNiTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone who is more familiar with R-devel and docker.

I am trying to test the new version of my package (maxLik) on R-devel,
using the docker container.  I am using rocker/r-devel as the base.  Note
that R-devel is called "RD" in the image.  I am copying in my package
sources and a few scripts, and run "RD CMD build" and "RD CMD check".
However, the latter fails with complaints about missing packages that are
installed and accessible when I run RD from command line.

Here are a few results:

* After a successful build inside the container, I run check:
root at f4024e015396:/# RD CMD check --as-cran maxLik_1.6-3.tar.gz
* using log directory ?//maxLik.Rcheck?
* using R Under development (unstable) (2025-08-11 r88561)
* using platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
* R was compiled by
    gcc (Debian 14.2.0-19) 14.2.0
    GNU Fortran (Debian 14.2.0-19) 14.2.0
* running under: Debian GNU/Linux trixie/sid
* using session charset: UTF-8
* using option ?--as-cran?
* checking for file ?maxLik/DESCRIPTION? ... OK
* this is package ?maxLik? version ?1.6-3?
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [6s/35s] OK
* checking package namespace information ... OK
* checking package dependencies ... OK
* checking if this is a source package ... OK
* checking if there is a namespace ... OK
* checking for executable files ... OK
* checking for hidden files and directories ... OK
* checking for portable file names ... OK
* checking for sufficient/correct file permissions ... OK
* checking serialization versions ... OK
* checking whether package ?maxLik? can be installed ... ERROR
Installation failed.
See ?//maxLik.Rcheck/00install.out? for details.
* DONE

Status: 1 ERROR
See
  ?//maxLik.Rcheck/00check.log?
for details.

* Take a look at the log:

root at f4024e015396:/# cat maxLik.Rcheck/00install.out
* installing *source* package ?maxLik? ...
** this is package ?maxLik? version ?1.6-3?

doWithOneRestart
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?maxLik?
* removing ?/maxLik.Rcheck/maxLik?

Apparently 'lattice' is missing???

* But it is there and I can load it with no errors:

root at f4024e015396:/# RDscript -e "packageVersion('lattice')"
[1] ?0.22.7?
root at f4024e015396:/# RDscript -e "library(lattice)"

Formerly I got similar missing package messages for other packages, I have
also tried to manually overwrote the R_LIB_USR environment variable (that
resulted in another error a bit further down in the line), and to install
my own package into different locations.  So far everything seems to lead
to the same problem.

Note that it works if I run it inside the container using the stable R ("R"
instead of "RD").  Currently it is based on r88561 (2025-08-11) version of
R-devel as you can see above.

For reference, here is the Dockerfile:

# -*- dockerfile-mode -*-
FROM rocker/r-devel
RUN apt-get install -y texlive-science
ENV INSIDE_DOCKER=true
COPY packages.R .  # install script for necessary packages
RUN RDscript packages.R  # install dependencies/suggestions etc
COPY pkg ./pkg  # copy the maxlik package source
COPY build-check .  # building/checking script
CMD ["bash"]


Any ideas?

Thanks.

I thought this was the issue, and even manually deleted /usr/bin/R and
/usr/bin/Rscript, but the problem persisted.  But now I am thinking that
/usr/bin/R may not be the relevant executables, the development version may
pull up something directly from /usr/lib/R/bin instead (the devel is
installed in /usr/local/lib/R ).

Will try!

Out of curiosity, why do they install two instances of R in a Docker
container?  On a traditional physical tin server, sure, you can't avoid
that sort of thing, but why in Docker?  I didn't see a rationale for it on
the Rocker wiki or website.

Because R CMD check uses a separate 'narrower' library path for checking a
package, you need to install the dependencies of the package you are
checking. So one way to address this is to 'RD CMD INSTALL lattice' (followed
by whatever else your package needs) in your running Docker session.

"They" here. It makes sense to have the underlying base be the r-base
container, and it has R. And because it gets R as a package this is harder to
disentangle afterwards.  Also, my live system also has R and RD so I was used
to _explicitly_ opt into r-devel ...  

Also note that given how R works an honours its installation path, the
following simple 'ln -s RD R' is all you need to have 'RD' be 'R' on that
container too:

  $ docker run --rm -ti rocker/r-devel \
       bash -c 'cd /usr/local/bin && ln -s RD R && R --version'

  (Line break just for exposition here)

but we don't do that by default because having R as well can be useful.

Hmm...

I am a little bit confused.

* Is this "narrower" library path for CMD check explained somewhere?
* Isn't lattice one of the default packages (graphics depends on it iirc),
so it should be installed in any case?

Thanks, anyway.  So far my tiny test package
https://github.com/otoomet/dummypkg (0.0-1) works, so now I am looking at
vignettes.

Cheers,
Ott

lattice is a "recommended" package.  Those are contributed packages, not 
base packages, so they are optional, but most distributions of R include 
them.

Regarding Dirk's "narrower" comment:  I think that is really his 
decision about the docker container, not a property of R CMD check.  R 
CMD check needs to be able to succeed if the only packages installed are 
the hard dependencies (Depends, Imports, plus base packages), but it 
doesn't actually install anything.  That's up to you before running it.

Make your package (in a test, maybe even just tests/hello.R) do
`print(.libPaths())` and assert it is different during tests.

This has nothing to do with the Docker container (but arguably related to how
I packaged R for Debian for 20-some years following a discussion with Kurt
and Fritz 'way back when' that lead to the current split and the three
default directories):

> .libPaths()                           # my comments for rationale below
[1] "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"     # system-wide, not packaged
[2] "/usr/lib/R/site-library"           # non-base/recommended packages from the distro
[3] "/usr/lib/R/library"                # base+recommended packages from the distrp
> 

plus optionally one below $HOME (and I personally do without).

Follow-ups, if any, maybe to r-sig-debian?

Hth,  Dirk

Obviously I cannot speak for Dirk and where his comment comes from :),
but WRE has since ages the following note:

	Note: R CMD check and R CMD build run R processes with
	--vanilla in which none of the user?s startup files are read.
	If you need R_LIBS set (to find packages in a non-standard
	library) you can set it in the environment: also you can use
	the check and build environment files (as specified by the
	environment variables R_CHECK_ENVIRON and R_BUILD_ENVIRON; if
	unset, files55 ~/.R/check.Renviron and ~/.R/build.Renviron are
	used) to set environment variables when using these utilities.

On my linux box I update and compile R patched and R devel regularly,
and at some point I got tired of also installing a lot of packages
(that I need for checking) each time.  So I moved all of these
additional packages to another library (where they are updated on an
as needed basis via update.packages(ask=FALSE, CheckBuilt=TRUE)). After
this restructure R patched and R devel could promptly not find those
packages anymore (until I changed my scripts to create appropriate
symbolic links, I did not want to go down the path of setting
environment variables).

Cheers,

	Berwin

Thanks, everyone, for responding.  Here a summary of my research so
far--I do not quite understand what I am doing, but I spotted
a number of different issues, and I got the checks to work.

* I was not aware of the distinction between default and recommended
  packages, and the fact that the latter is not installed by default
  (although usually they are on production systems).
* in the rocker/r-devel container, R and R-devel use (partly)
  overlapping lib paths: `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library` and
  `/usr/lib/R/library`.

* R and R-devel have different packages installed by default, but
  because both access `/usr/lib/R/library`, both seem to have access
  to both default and recommended packages.
* `RD CMD check` uses a different lib path, containing
  `/usr/local/lib/R/library` and a temporary folder.  The latter will
  contain the needed packages given they are installed in a certain
  location (I still do not understand how they get there, and from
  where).
* The message I got -- package _lattice_ not available -- was due to
  two reasons: a) it is a recommended, not a default package; and b)
  it is installed in `/usr/lib/R/library` where it is normally
  accessible for both R and R-devel, and hence was not installed
  again.  However, from there it is not copied to the temporary folder that
  R CMD check uses.
* Finally, by setting `ENV R_LIBS=/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/` in
  the Dockerfile, the checks work.  But I am not sure why.

It would be great to isolate R and R-devel better in the docker
image.  Not sure whether it is easy to do...

Cheers,
Ott

With all due respect, that summary was more misleading than helpful.  This is
also the wrong list to discuss the matter as a few Debian packaging specific
aspects appear to be falsely seen as general R features. I reiterate that
follow-ups, if any, would really be better suited to either the r-sig-debian
list (and note its 'subscribe first, then post' policy) or possibly the git
repository of this specific container.

Dear Ott

Perhaps a dumb question but does your package DESCRIPTION include a 
dependency on lattice (or i,port or suggest)?

Dear package developers:

I have run into a dilemma...

I received a message that my package has errors on the development version of R; and that I must fix the error by August 26. Since I will be traveling out of the country from Aug 17--27, I knew I had to fix the error right away - which I did. But when I tried to submit the updated package, I was unable to do so because CRAN is on vacation until Aug 19. Note that this is after I leave on my trip, and I will not be able to submit anything to CRAN while I am traveling.

So I can't submit my package until Aug 28 at the earliest, and this is two days after the Aug 26 deadline I was given. What can I do to save my package from getting the axe? Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks

Just tell the CRAN guys your situation and ask for an extension.

Message-ID: <b4c48f18-ef48-4bbf-b1bd-1e279a8b0e28@gmx.de>

Hi everyone,

which approach should I try to use for official CRAN submissions of R 
packages using OpenCL and GPUs, if none of the available solutions would 
pass the CRAN checks.

Currently I see two possibilities of building an R package deploying 
OpenCL with a GPU, however neither of them would pass the CRAN checks 
directly. The first solution would be to use the approach of the 
"OpenCL" package from CRAN 
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenCL/index.html) relying on 
the user to set local variables (OCL = ".../SDK/...", and so forth). The 
second approach would be to use something like cmake, to circumvent the 
need for the user to take care of certain requirements prior to 
installation, as is done in 
https://github.com/jmaerte/cmake-rcpp-template. The cmake approach poses 
the problem, that the paths generated are too long and thus fails the 
CRAN check and a building of the package is not possible.

Best regards

Quirin

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] html manual notes
Message-ID: <CAPpXX+DJY=YFDTViwBHrLbmu2q4fYfGaNKHnVQ7sgkEmvDB8PQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been trying to address this note (now failing CRAN submission) from
building the HTML version of the manual.

Check: HTML version of manual, Result: NOTE
  Found the following HTML validation problems:
  temis_download.html:61:1 (temis_download.Rd:25): Warning: inserting
implicit <p>
  temis_download.html:63:1 (temis_download.Rd:27): Warning: inserting

  temis_download.html:61:1 (temis_download.Rd:25): Warning: trimming empty
<p>
  temis_download.html:63:1 (temis_download.Rd:27): Warning: trimming empty
<p>

The cause is two figures I have in the manual page of the temins_download
functions:
#' @param ...
#' \if{html}{\out{<p>Europe region coverage:</p>}\out{<div
style="text-align:
left">}\figure{March2025_vitD_cloudy_europe.png}{options:
style="width:500px;max-width:50\%;"}\out{</div>}}
#' \if{latex}{Europe region
coverage:\out{\begin{center}}\figure{March2025_vitD_cloudy_europe.png}\out{\end{center}}}
#' \if{html}{\out{<p>World region coverage:</p>}\out{<div
style="text-align: left">}\figure{March2025_vitD_cloudy_world.png}{options:

#' \if{latex}{World region
coverage:\out{\begin{center}}\figure{March2025_vitD_cloudy_world.png}\out{\end{center}}}
#' @param ...

I've tried a few variations of the \if{html} lines and updated to
tidy-html5, some similar notes were resolved but inserting/trimming
implicit <p> remain. If anyone has any suggestions for how to format the
offending lines to resolve this?

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <c9377d13d97047fd904b1699fcdf75a1@krebsregister.nrw.de>

Disclaimer: I am building a package for local usage (for now), which will probably be not submitted to CRAN. If you view this posting as off topic, please say so or ignore.

In a vignette like this one https://rdrr.io/cran/DBI/f/vignettes/DBI-advanced.Rmd, code is introduced that, on invocation, would try to establish a DB connection which probably would not exist on someone else's than the maintainer's configuration. Would the maintainer expect the user of the package to tweak her local configuration, or rather vignette script, to make the code run? The R packages book reads:

Note that since you build vignettes locally, CRAN only receives the html/pdf and the source code. However, CRAN does not re-build the vignette. It only checks that the code is runnable (by running it).

What happens when running the script on the user's configuration if the DB handle does not exist? Or indeed, when CRAN runs the code and no DB is built by running the code?

This posting https://forum.posit.co/t/vignettes-that-require-locally-stored-data/2392 seems to come close to my question.

Presumably when your code tries to open the database, it will fail with 
an error.  What you should do is catch that error so the vignette 
doesn't fail, and print a message to the user explaining why things 
didn't work.

If you are using knitr, you can call `knitr::knit_exit()`
and it will quit at that point without appearing to fail.

You can also pre-render your vignette on your local machine, where you have access to the database. Downside is that you cannot automate this, so you will have to render again when you update your package. See: https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/#the-solution-locally-knitting-rmarkdown

Message-ID: <CAL3ufUJ9uk8VZsUyUvhrjR5_H2AvheGN6Qk8YKDYW1rr+ViJgQ@mail.gmail.com>

*Question:* what is the best way to access a DOTSXP from R's C API in a
function call.

Over at extendr (1) we'd like to be able to utilize `...` from the body of
a Rust function?with initial motivation being to support S3 generics like
print(x, ...).

I don't see any recommendations / or mention of accessing DOTSXP in WRE.
The closest I can find is from R internals (2) repo which says

"Easiest to get to with findVar(R_DotsSymbol, env) or similar."


From R's C API would this mean we would want to use something like:

findVar(R_DotsSymbol, R_GetCurrentEnv()) to get the dots pairlist from the
function's environment?

It's almost certainly easier to pass something like list(...) to your 
external function.  That will evaluate each of the arguments in the 
appropriate environments and put them in a list.

If you want to receive the promises without them being evaluated, I 
don't know if there's a documented way to do it in the C API.  You could 
always use the tidyverse approach and ask your users to pass formulas 
instead of expressions.

In the future, there may be a C interface for that:

Currently, working with promises most likely requires some non-API
entry points. What's the intended R-side call from the S3 method to
Rust? What's the intended use on the Rust side?

Generally, the best way to get access to the current environment is passing
environment() as an argument to your C function. I know that people will
tell you to use R_GetCurrentEnv() in C, but that does not work when the C
call is an argument to another function. For example:

tryCatch({
   .External(.C_<funname>, <other args>)
})

If you tried to call R_GetCurrentEnv() inside your C function, it would
return the environment of doTryCatch, and that's not what you. Better
instead to just do this:

tryCatch({
   .External(.C_<funname>, environment(), <other args>)
})


Next, once you're in C, and you have the environment, presumably using
something like

SEXP rho = CAR(args); args = CDR(args);

you would find it in the environment:

SEXP dots = Rf_findVarInFrame(rho, R_DotsSymbol);

or

SEXP dots = Rf_findVar(R_DotsSymbol, rho);

The best way to determine the length of the object is this:

R_xlen_t n = (TYPEOF(dots) == DOTSXP) ? Rf_length(dots) : 0;

The reason you should switch on TYPEOF is in case ... contains zero
arguments, in which case it is R_MissingArg.

>From there, it is just a pair list. You can select specific elements like
this:

CAR(Rf_nthcdr(dots, <index>))

or you can loop over them like this:

SEXP d = dots;
for (R_xlen_t i = 0; i < n; i++, d = CDR(d)) {
    di = CAR(d);
}

However, the values of di are R_MissingArg if that element is empty or a
promise. And while you cannot access the components of a promise, you are
allowed to evaluate it.

SEXP d = dots;
for (R_xlen_t i = 0; i < n; i++, d = CDR(d)) {
    di = CAR(d);
    if (di == R_MissingArg) {
        <do something if missing>
    }
    else {
        di = Rf_eval(di, R_EmptyEnv);
        <do something with promise value>
    }
}

The environment used in Rf_eval does not matter, when evaluating a promise,
the promise environment is always used.


That being said, Rchk may complain of some objects not being protected. To
make it happen, you should protect dots right after you use
Rf_findVarInFrame, as well as protect di right after you use Rf_eval (don't
forget to unprotect di at the end of each loop).

    Iris

Oh, forgot to mention. Using Rf_eval on a promise a second time does not
re-evaluate the promise. It simply returns the already calculated promise
value. So if that comes up, no need to worry about it.

Hopefully we'll be able to complete an API for doing these sorts of
things safely in the next few months.

Thank you all for such a wonderful discussion thread!

I think we can hold off on an implementation until there is a formal C API
for doing so.

Message-ID: <87dbbfc8-48be-4e5a-b188-988656d36572@eoos.dds.nl>


I recently submitted a package to CRAN that creates a device that 
outputs into the terminal (for terminals that support the Terminal 
Graphics Protocol (and hopefully in the future also terminals that 
support sixel)) [1].

It introduces a 'tgp' function that does the following:

1. It opens a ragg::agg_capture device.

2. When term_col = TRUE: sets the background and foreground colors of 
the device to those of the terminal (when these can be detected).

3. Every time the ragg:agg_capture device is updated: updates the plot 
in the terminal.

Point 2 raises an issue from CRAN as par() changes some properties and 
these are not set back at the and of the function call. This is 
intentional, as otherwise setting them would be useless; it is the 
intention that the colors of subsequent plot calls are changed.  I am 
not sure how I can set the colors of the device to those in the terminal 
(as requested by the user) without violating this rule.

Are there alternative ways of helping the user to set the colors of the 
device without violating this issue?

Could this be an exception to the rule as the argument intentionally 
changes par()? This could be made more explicit by changing the default 
value to FALSE. I guess this question is better asked at the CRAN 
maintainers, but perhaps there are other package that do something 
similar that I might look at.

Instead of having this functionality in the tgp() function, I could 
create a 'set_figure_colours_to_terminal()` function (perhaps with a 
corresponding reset function). However, this function would run into the 
same issue.

I appreciate any suggestions/help that yoy could give.

Best,
Jan

Someone asked for the response I got from CRAN. I included it below:

---
[... another issue where I forgot a \value{} in the documentation of one 
of the functions]

Please make sure that you do not change the user's options, par or 
working directory. If you really have to do so within functions, please 
ensure with an *immediate* call of on.exit() that the settings are reset 
when the function is exited.
e.g.:
...
oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) # code line i
on.exit(par(oldpar)) # code line i + 1
...
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # somewhere after
...
e.g.: -> R/tgp.R
If you're not familiar with the function, please check ?on.exit. This 
function makes it possible to restore options before exiting a function 
even if the function breaks. Therefore it needs to be called immediately 
after the option change within a function.
For more details: 
<https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/code_issues.html#change-of-options-graphical-parameters-and-working-directory>

Please fix and resubmit.

I understand why this is asked and I also know how to handle this in 
usual cases. I am not sure how to handle this in the specific case here. 
Perhaps I missed some alternative way of handling this.

Best,
Jan

Hi Kristian,

Also replying to the list.

Thanks for the suggestion. Personally I have something like the 
following in my ~/.Rprofile

if (interactive() && terminalgraphics::has_tgp_support()) {
   options(device = terminalgraphics::tgp)
}

So that doesn't work well with your suggestion, but creating a (have to 
think of a better name) `get_par` function, might at least make it 
easier for the user to set the colors when it turns out to be impossible 
to set these from tgp():

tgp()
opar <- par(terminalgraphics::get_par())
plot(...)
par(opar)

`get_par` would then be similar to what you suggest. The disadvantage is 
that this code is only relevant when `tgp` is the active device, so 
users would need to either write device specific code or wrap this in 
if-statements. Perhaps a better solution would be to allow for a user 
defined callback to `tgp` that is called after the device is created. A 
user might then be able to do something like:

if (interactive() && terminalgraphics::has_tgp_support()) {
   set_par <- function() par(terminalgraphics::get_par())
   options(device = terminalgraphics::tgp, tgp_callback = set_par)
}

This is still extra work for the user, but avoids device specific code 
in the user scripts.

Thanks again.

Jan

If you add an empty line between \figure{...} and \out{</div>}, R will

it's still inside the <div>. Then the <p> won't be empty, and there

I can understand caution about functions with side effects, but rejecting a
package on those grounds alone seems strange to me.

I can easily find thousands of calls to par() on CRAN without any
associated on.exit() cleanup ([1] [2] [3] [4] with a full regex search [5])

[1]

[4]
https://github.com/cran/GD/blob/1ce7c3c8b63dafb1d9d0a9e2ffcd6af4917fa077/R/sesu.R#L25
[5]
https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+%2F%5Cn%5B%5E%23%5D*%5B%5E%5Cw.%5Dpar%5C%28%5B+%5Cn%5D*%5B%5E.%29+%5Cn%22%27%5D%2F+path%3A%2F%5C.R%24%2F+NOT+%22on.exit%22+NOT+path%3A%2Fdemo%2F+NOT+path%3A%2Ftests%2F&type=code

I see no reference to 'par' inside {tools} (in particular QC.R), so R CMD
check is not looking for this.

IMO, clearly documenting the side effects of any such functions is more
than enough.

I agree.
I've also been authoring a package with one function whose
*purpose* it is to modify par() conveniently.
The function is very old (older than R; I wrote it for S /
S-plus in my first post-doc year in 1990:
  https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/sfsmisc/html/mult.fig.html

It *is* however careful to return the previous par() {in <result>$old.par  }
such that when you use mult.fig() in a function or an R script, you can easily
add an on.exit() in your function or use par(<....>) directly to revert the global par()
to its original values.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] OpenCL Headers in R packages
Message-ID: <9091fe96-f2f0-4792-a0e3-03ecf245e9c5@gmx.de>

Hi everyone,

building an R package following the work of Simon Urbanek 
(https://github.com/s-u/OpenCL and 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenCL/index.html) still yields 
the error from CRAN about environmental variables required for linking.

Could you please tell me more about the procedure (or possible 
formalities with CRAN) how to submit an R package using OpenCL headers?

Best regards,

Quirin

Thanks Micheal and Martin,

I have contacted the people from CRAN, and they have let me know that in 
this case it is indeed reasonable to set par and not set it back.

I will also think about Martins suggestion. Currently I return an other 
object, but I might be able to add the old par-values to that.

Thanks.

Best,
Jan

In theory, copying the OpenCL approach should have been enough (most
Windows users would get the binaries from CRAN and not worry about
environment variables), except (as you point out) OpenCL is not
currently built on Win-Builder for R-release and R-devel (only R-oldrel
works). I think you need to ask Uwe Ligges to help set up the OpenCL
SDK for R-release and R-devel the same way it's set up for R-oldrel.
But there might be a better solution:

> Could you please tell me more about the procedure (or possible

> headers?

Since a free software (Apache-2.0) OpenCL SDK exists [1], it could be
made part of Rtools, which is the recommended approach for non-trivial
third-party dependencies [2]. It's already packaged in MSYS2 [3], but
not in MXE. I think the best way forward is to write an MXE Makefile
[4] to produce a package with the OpenCL headers, the import library,
and the ICD loader.

There is one complication: unlike most third-party dependencies in
Rtools, OpenCL must be dynamically linked. This probably means
packaging OpenCL.dll and putting it on the %PATH% (so that R packages
can be built and loaded even on systems without a real OpenCL ICD).
Hopefully this won't cause any conflicts with the system OpenCL.dll
(all it needs to do is export a standard set of functions and look for
ICDs in standard locations).

Someone even started that work back in 2017 [5], but didn't complete
it. Try contacting the people who worked the GitHub pull request, see
if they need any help. When MXE accepts the patch, or if you get stuck,
ask Tomas Kalibera about including the two packages in Rtools.

Hi,

After submitting a newbie package to CRAN, I received a notification after the automatic checks that it was pending a manual check.
However, I haven't heard back from CRAN since. Also, it is nowhere to be found on <https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/>

Should I wait to receive a report on the manual check, or should I contact CRAN?

P.S., Results of the automatic check are here:

Hi Pepijn,

You can see your package at https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/newbies/. Note that sorting is a bit special with capital first letters first, then packages with small first letters. It has only been four days according to the date stamp, so maybe give it a couple more days.

Regards,
Kristian

Emne: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN submission status lost

Hi,

After submitting a newbie package to CRAN, I received a notification after the automatic checks that it was pending a manual check.
However, I haven't heard back from CRAN since. Also, it is nowhere to be found on <https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/>

Should I wait to receive a report on the manual check, or should I contact CRAN?

P.S., Results of the automatic check are here:
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/blosc_0.0.5_20250821_234040/>

Indeed, as the auto notification says "A CRAN team member will typically 
respond to you within the next 10 working days." Only two passed so far. 
CRAN received > 100 newbie submissions within three days.

Hi Both,

Thanks for the quick response. Indeed, it was my bad. I overlooked the listing at CRAN incoming due to the sorting. I will patiently await the report of the manual inspection.

Pepijn, I bookmarked this shiny app a while ago:
https://r-hub.github.io/cransays/articles/dashboard.html

super helpful for the "is it just me? Did i miss something?" view. It lets
you see if other people have been waiting as well.

There is also the 'ciw' package with its 'ciw()' (== 'CRAN Incoming Watcher')
function that is a little lighter and faster.

Which is yseful for a quick run at the R prompt, or, via the `littler`
wrapper ciw.r at the command-line, which is what I do.

Default settings stop at 168 hours, 50 packages, and skip 'newbies', all that
can be overriden via command-libe flags to 'ciw,r' or arguments to
'ciw::ciw()'. It also sorts the display by 'Age' so often you see the states
'pretest', 'waiting', 'recheck' and 'inspect' intermixed.

$ ciw.r -h
Usage: ciw.r [-h] [-x] [-a] [-m] [-i] [-t] [-p] [-w] [-r] [-s] [-n] [-u] [-l rows] [-g age] [-z] [ARG...]

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] corrupt parsing in GitHub Action
Message-ID: <02a796e2-d57d-4f42-aca4-9747fdcf3ffe@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


The R parser in GitHub action seems to be getting corrupted in 
processing "sbgraves237/Ecdat".[1] For one, I'm getting:


358:22: unexpected symbol
357: ##
358: plotUSGPDpresidents('fedReceipts


I replace the single quote with a double quote and get the same problem 
with a single quote later ... except when it gets to:


plot(USGDPpresidents[, "Year"], Surp2-Surplus, type='l')


In that line, it doesn't like either single or double quotes.


What do you suggest I do to get past this?
Thanks,
Spencer Graves

This has nothing to do with any GitHub Action. Your example is
corrupt, you need to escape `%` characters in .Rd files.

 Package Ecdat"
Message-ID: <87a09244-db25-4445-95c9-48c81ead78a3@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


"CRAN Package Check Results for Package Ecdat"[1] flags a "NOTE" on all 
platforms. I don't understand any of them.


For example, the check results from some but not all platforms include:


** No Authors at R field in DESCRIPTION.
Please add one, modifying
   Authors at R: c(person(given = "Yves",
                       family = "Croissant",
                       role = "aut",
                       email = "yves.croissant at let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr"),
                person(given = "Spencer",
                       family = "Graves",
                       role = c("aut", "cre"),
                       email = "spencer.graves at effectivedefense.org"))
as necessary.


** The DESCRIPTION file includes exactly this Author at R field, which 
seems to be what they want, but which I read as complaining it's not 
there. ???


** Some of these check results also complain about "Lost braces". The 
braces seem to be there with the standard syntax that I understand from 
what I read in "Writing R Extensions".


** "Found the following Rd file(s) with Rd \link{} targets missing 
package anchors:
   USFinanceIndustry.Rd: readNIPA"


** In that Rd file, I find "\code{\link[Ecfun]{readNIPA}}"


What am I missing? Thanks, Spencer Graves

Version 0.4-2 didn't include that.  The link you sent points to check 
results for that version (which was uploaded in 2022).

I think the "lost braces" are unnecessary braces.  For example, you have

   \doi{10.18128/D010.V10.0}{IPUMS USA: Version 10.0 [dataset]. 
Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS}

as though \doi{} needs two arguments, but it only needs one.

In 0.4-2 you have

\seealso{
   \code{\link{readNIPA}}
}

Hi, Duncan:


Thanks for the reply.


Please excuse: I should have checked that but didn't think to do so.


Thanks again, Spencer Graves

Thanks for all the tips.

@josiah I'm aware of cransays (It's not a shiny app by the way, it uses pkgdown in combination with GH pages). When I checked it, I missed the paginating button at the bottom. So a silly mistake on my behalf.

@Dirk I was not aware of the 'ciw' package. I will give it a try.

General conclusion is that I need to double check before bothering other people ;).

Pepijn

There is also the 'ciw' package with its 'ciw()' (== 'CRAN Incoming Watcher')
function that is a little lighter and faster.

Which is yseful for a quick run at the R prompt, or, via the `littler`

Default settings stop at 168 hours, 50 packages, and skip 'newbies', all that
can be overriden via command-libe flags to 'ciw,r' or arguments to
'ciw::ciw()'. It also sorts the display by 'Age' so often you see the states
'pretest', 'waiting', 'recheck' and 'inspect' intermixed.

$ ciw.r -h
Usage: ciw.r [-h] [-x] [-a] [-m] [-i] [-t] [-p] [-w] [-r] [-s] [-n] [-u] [-l rows] [-g age] [-z] [ARG...]

Hi everyone,

sry for the double mail - I included the old error output from a 
previous version, only the location of the?#include "CL/cl.hpp"? changed 
to ocl.h in /src.

CRAN Submission of package

an error.

That is a side effect from CRAN and me trying to figure out how to accomodate
breaking changes in the new Armadillo upstream. Ignore this for now, this is
a likely side-effect of a tested version being on the CRAN machine when this
ran. The released RcppArmadillo will not trigger ut,

Do you ensure the CL headers are installed?  On Debian these come for example
from package opencl-clhpp-headers [1] (but you have no general control over what
is installed).  At least package gpuR ships it for R, and you check how few
other packages test for this via a search at github.org/cran (a mirror) [2].

It looks to me like you need to take better care of the 'configure does not
find cl.hpp' case (and you need to add logic to your package to have that test).

Thanks! It seems that the headers can be easily shipped without much 
effort inside the inst/include/CL/, working at least for both Debian and 
Windows for now. (Updates available on 
https://github.com/Quirinms/GeneralizedUmatrixGPU/tree/main)

However, there comes another problem afterwards with a dynamic 
library/shared object (Win/Debian).

After finding the headers, following message appeared:

D:\rtools45\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix\bin/ld.exe: cannot find -lOpenCL: No such file or directory

similar in Debian:

Error: package or namespace load failed for ?GeneralizedUmatrixGPU? in library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib):
  shared object ?GeneralizedUmatrixGPU.so? not found


For?Windows there is more output using -lOpenCL --verbose:

There's an extra line copied from OpenCL's src/Makevars file:

>> clang++-19 -std=gnu++17 -shared -L/home/hornik/tmp/R/lib -Wl,-O1 -o
>> GeneralizedUmatrixGPU.so RcppExports.o trainSESOM.o -lOpenCL
>> -L/home/hornik/tmp/R/lib -lR
>> mv GeneralizedUmatrixGPU.so R_OpenCL.so # <-- here

The OpenCL package only needs this on Windows so that the system OpenCL.dll
doesn't conflict with with the package OpenCL.dll; the change in
src/Makevars was done to simplify loading the shared library from the
package NAMESPACE [*]. Your package doesn't need to rename the shared
library.

> D:\rtools45\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix\bin/ld.exe: cannot find
> -lOpenCL: No such file or directory

That could be due to the OpenCL SDK shipping the import library in
lib/x86_64 instead of lib/x64 where your package's 'configure.win'
expects it, or for some other reason. When you discussed the installation of OpenCL SDK on Win-Builder with Dr. Uwe Ligges, was a specific version of it mentioned?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Cannot implement test configuration
Message-ID: <f489d1dc6d0443a0b3334d24db9c7ab1@krebsregister.nrw.de>

I am trying to install a test configuration for an existing package under Windows 10. Here?s my in- and the system?s output.

> usethis::use_testthat(edition = 3, parallel = TRUE)
? Setting active project to "//some_servername/UserHome$/jhuesing/R/some_packagename".
? Adding "true" to Config/testthat/parallel.
Error: [EPERM] Failed to stat '//some_servername/UserHome$': operation not permitted

//some_servername/UserHome$/jhuesing points to my personal directory, which is mapped to a drive specification consisting of a letter and a colon. While I rightfully don?t have access as jhuesing to //some_servername/UserHome$, I should have access to //some_servername/UserHome$/jhuesing, and if R would address the directory via letter + colon, the system probably would permit the action.

Is there a way to specify the directory path in which testthat shall be added, allowing me to write the path in a way the system would accept?

I would recommend to stick to drive letter based paths. UNC paths are 
not fully supported even in base R. Some R functions support them, or 
try to support them, but? it is very unlikely that they would generally 
work and they are certainly not tested. Sometimes they don't work with 
external tools, including tools used commonly with R or to build R/packages.

So I would only use UNC paths if I were going to debug/test specific 
issues with UNC paths. For anything else, I would defensively use drive 
letters.

I would gladly avoid UNC paths. What is the option/the parameter to set a path in usethis::use_testthat()?

Hello, All:


TWO QUESTIONS:


1. HOW TO FIX "Number of redirects hit maximum amount"?


For the Ecdat package, CRAN reported, "Number of redirects hit maximum 
amount [www.cde.ca.gov]". Uwe Ligges asked, "Please fix and resubmit."


"www.cde.ca.gov" works for me when I enter it into a browser. Moreover, 
that URL was unchanged after the page appeared. Also, I've looked for 
tools to trace redirects and have so far been unable to find any that 
find any redirect from "www.cde.ca.gov".


2. GITHUB ACTION WITH "--as-cran"?


Is there a way to modify GitHub Action so "R CMD check --as-cran" runs 
on one of the platforms?


** I'm currently concerned about "https://github.com/sbgraves237/Ecdat"


FYI: "R CMD check --as-cran Ecdat_0.4.6.tar.gz" on my local computer a 
few minutes ago found several "(possibly) invalid URLs", none of which 
reported "Number of redirects hit maximum amount". Also, 
"www.cde.ca.gov" was NOT flagged this time.


Should I just document this in "cran-comments.md" and hope for the best?


Thanks, Spencer Graves

I guess you need a different URL.
Have you tried in a web browser? Firefox tells me locally "redirection 
error" (translated from German) and I cannot see any web page. So this 
URL seems to need a change.

Uwe Ligges

   Hmm. Maybe there's something region-specific? From Canada, it works

There is a single request when loading the page that results in a 301
status code which is a GET request for https://www.google.com/jsapi

Test the url with curl -I https://www.cde.ca.gov/

Curl results in this response, though, which indicates that a 302 redirect
status does occur when the site thinks you're a bot (fair enough in these
LLM days where companies are stealing the internet).

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Server: rdwr
Date: Tue, 02 Sep 2025 21:12:14 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: keep-alive

Location:
https://validate.perfdrive.com/?ssa=613ca131-5a8f-43fc-a8f0-b8263d09dd74&ssb=98511261404&ssc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cde.ca.gov%2F&ssi=befc02e3-ctxv-4d8c-a298-7ca114da9162&ssk=botmanager_support at radware.com&ssm={snipped}

It's tough because how can anyone be confident that the `Location` header
will ever actually resolve to the provided url?

Hi, Uwe and Ben:


Thanks for the replies. That URL worked just now in Firefox, Safari and 
Chrome on my Mac and in the browser on my iPhone in Kansas City, 
Missouri, USA.


It's in the documentation for "The California Test Score Data Set" 
(Ecdat::Caschool), which was created years ago by Yves Croissant, a 
professor at the University of Lyon, France, and author of (2024) 
Microeconometrics with R (https://ycroissant.github.io/micsr_book/) and 
several other publications that use R.


The fact that it didn't work for Uwe worries me.[1]


I hesitate to degrade the work of Yves Croissant. I plan to document 
this in "cran-comments.md" and proceed with the other checks outlined in 
Wickham and Bryan, "R Packages". The current version on GitHub has green 
check marks on 5 platforms. As I mentioned, "R CMD check --as-cran" 
locally flagged several URLs that I have checked multiple times and 
found them good -- but did NOT flag "cde.ca.gov".


Reasonable?
Thanks again.
Spencer Graves

What's the traceback() output immediately after this error happens? If
you post it, someone may be able to point out the offending code and
perhaps find a way to convince it to use the drive letter instead of
the UNC path.

Since the error is encountered by code in 'usethis' (or somewhere
downstream), likely not in base R, you may also get a more direct
answer by following links at <https://usethis.r-lib.org/SUPPORT.html>.

Definitely. For me, with or without cookies enabled,
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ reliably returns a 303 redirect to
https://www.cde.ca.gov/wafalert.html?_event_transid=<large hexadecimal
string>, which in turn returns a 303 redirect to the same address.

The Internet Wayback Machine does have some good snapshots; not all
captures are redirects to validate.perfdrive.com:

FWIW same here from the other hemisphere - it's an infinite loop in their webserver. I?d say that confirms that the link is not accessible, so definitely needs fixing.

Looking at the package, I think that link is entirely pointless anyway, because it doesn't even point to the data source, so either point to the actual page with the data or remove (pointing to the archive for the CDE front page is just as useless IMHO).

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks, Ivan. Here is a transcript of the session. Note that functions from the usethis package are invoked from devtools::test(), experts of which I figured I might find most likely here.

Best wishes

What's the traceback() output immediately after this error happens? If you post it, someone may be able to point out the offending code and perhaps find a way to convince it to use the drive letter instead of the UNC path.

Since the error is encountered by code in 'usethis' (or somewhere downstream), likely not in base R, you may also get a more direct answer by following links at <https://usethis.r-lib.org/SUPPORT.html>.

A common cause of such problems is path normalization.? Base R tries not 
to introduce UNC paths, e.g. path normalization of a path including a 
drive letter tries not to turn that path into UNC, exactly for this 
reason: there are tools around, not just R, that do not fully support 
UNC paths.

From the traceback transcript I gather that the error message is issued by an R script, as an argument to message(), not to stop(), and that the message refers to the normalised path.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] winbuilder status?
Message-ID: <3c4db99e-5401-4a49-9a42-34dca4b5521e@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


How can I find the status of Win-builder requests?


Yesterday at around 22:00 UTC (17:00 UTC-5, Kansas City, USA) I 
submitted three requests to check the results of a change to Ecdat, and 
I have not seen the results now roughly 17 hours later. I used:


devtools::check_win_devel()
devtools::check_win_release()
devtools::check_win_oldrelease()


I got results from previous checks a few minutes before submitting these 
requests.


*** THANKS TO Ivan Krylov <ikrylov at disroot.org>, who suggested replacing 
"https://www.cde.ca.gov/" with 
"http://web.archive.org/web/20250823081216/https://www.cde.ca.gov/". I 
tested this locally with "R CMD check --as-cran Ecdat_0.4.6.tar.gz", and 
it seemed to work. I'd like to see the winbuilder results before 
resubmitting the package to CRAN.


Thanks, Spencer Graves

I don't see it in the queue:

# A tibble: 0 ? 5
# ? 5 variables: package <chr>, version <pckg_vrs>, folder <chr>, time 
<dttm>,
#   size <int>

but IIRC this only shows packages that are actually in the queue, not 
those being processed ...

   cheers

Out of curiosity, what do the following report?

    file.exists("//some_servername/UserHome$")
    dir.exists("//some_servername/UserHome$")
    fs::file_exists("//some_servername/UserHome$")
    fs::dir_exists(""//some_servername/UserHome$")

Looking at the sources, 'usethis' should be checking if the path
exists before trying to create it, but perhaps that check is
unexpectedly returning FALSE.

Best,
Kevin

Hi, Ben:


Thanks for this. I've added "foghorn::winbuilder_queue()" to my routine 
script ;-)


AND I restarted the ones I couldn't find, and they all completed as 
expected.

Hello, Simon, Ben, Ivan, Uwe:


Thanks for the suggestions.


I followed Ivan's suggestion of replacing the problem URL with a call to 
a copy on archive.org, and it passed all the tests locally and on 
winbuilder devel, release, and oldrelease.

So, the goal is for a drive letter path to be in the above output
instead of a UNC path?

The error happens in fs::dir_create()... [1]

...but the path originates from somewhere in usethis::proj_path().

Does getwd() return a path with a drive letter? If not, does it help to
setwd() to a drive letter path first?

Apparently usethis::proj_get() uses a UNC path. Does it help to give a
drive letter path to usethis::proj_set() first?

Thanks for your collective curiosity.

Ivan:
I am quite confident that the issue would be solved if the UNC version of the path would be replaced by the letter-plus-colon  MS-DOS-style expression. Typing getwd() indeed returns a letter-plus-colon path.

Message-ID: <AM8PR10MB4660CE222C4F6DB867BE0DF1A700A@AM8PR10MB4660.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,

After submitting a newbie package to CRAN, I know receive some check-results that need to be addressed. There are issues raised by the gcc-ASAN, gcc-UBSAN and M1mac checks. More specifically here are the check results:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_blosc.html

I think I know how to address these issues, however... How can I test if my fixes (https://github.com/pepijn-devries/blosc/pull/27/files) were adequate? When I check the submitted package with rhub's the gcc-ASAN docker file, the issues reported by CRAN don't pop up. I'm also not sure how to reproduce the M1mac results. In short: how can I assure that my fixes are adequate, other then resubmitting to CRAN and hoping for the best?

Kind regards,

Pepijn

and I guess, using the excellent and "official" Rtools for
Windows (by Tomas Kalibera), and there a version of
	R CMD check <pkg>
may have helped to save  a lot of time (over using  devtools and all the extra
mumbo jumbo it carries along, but of course that is heretic to say,
... and you need _not_ tell me so ;-).

It seems like you may be the only one able to narrow this down further. 
Here's what you could do:

   debug(usethis::proj_set)
   usethis::proj_set(getwd())

This will single-step through proj_set.  If you are in RStudio or a 
similar environment, it will display the values of local variables.  You 
will probably be able to see the string 
"//some-project/UserHome$/jhuesing/R/Tools/ICD_O_3/ICDO3" show up in one 
of those at some point. (I'd guess it will happen really soon, after the 
call to proj_path_prep(path). If you don't see local variables 
displayed, then you can run

   <something>

to print the current value of that variable, or print(<something>) if 
the variable name matches a browser command.

It's likely that you'll be able to identify the exact function call that 
produces the UNC path.  Then you can try to see if that same function 
call does the same thing at top level.   You can call unexported 
functions using the triple colon notation, e.g. 
usethis:::proj_path_prep().  Then you can repeat:

   debug(usethis:::proj_path_prep)

or use the browser "s" command to step into that call.  Use undebug() to 
remove the debugging flags from functions after you find out they aren't 
interesting.

Is it this one?
https://github.com/r-hub/containers/blob/main/containers/gcc-asan/Dockerfile

Looks like it's based on Fedora 40 with GCC 14, while Prof. Brian
Ripley runs the gcc-ASAN checks on Fedora 42 with GCC 15:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/README.txt

(If README.txt and 00check.log ever disagree, trust 00check.log.)

Sometimes the issues are trivial to reproduce with any version of gcc
-fsanitize. Sometimes you need the right compiler version. Sometimes
you need to compile R and all dependencies from source so that they are
all instrumented by sanitizers. Sometimes even a fully reproducible
build environment, if it existed, wouldn't be enough because the issue
is only visible when the CPU is fully loaded with some threads being
starved for CPU time [*].

I think that currently, the approach most likely to reproduce the
problem is to start with a Fedora 42 container and follow the
README.txt together with WRE 4.3.3 and 4.3.4 to build R and all
dependencies from source. There are many shortcuts that could be taken
(and the ones taken by r-hub containers save a lot of electricity and
time running CI!), but they carry a risk of missing the problem.

> I'm also not sure how to reproduce the M1mac results.

If you skip install.libs('blosc') in CI on macOS, the failure should be
reproducible, but then there's no way for the configure script to
succeed. Were you asked to fix the error messages produced by the
configure script?

> In short: how can I assure that my fixes are adequate, other then

If you'd like to provably prevent the dereference of the [-1] subscript
from happening, consider moving the if (target_unit < 0) stop(...)
inside the previous if (target_unit < 0) branch, before accessing the
arrays. This way even a strange new unit (or a damaged file) won't cause
undefined behaviour.

Yes, that's one of the sanitizers I've used for testing

Thank you for the thorough explanation. I see that reproducing sanitizer
results isn't for the faint of heart. I will have to ponder if I really
want to put all this effort in trying to reproduce the reported results,
or just making sensible adjustments based on the reported issues.

Prof. Ripley did send an e-mail with specific requests. Three of the requests
are related to the configure script: 1) I should use c++ flags instead of
c-flags. That was my bad, I have fixed those. 2) In case of failure the
configure script should exit with an informative message. I have updated the
configure script by informing the user how to install the system requirements,
when not found. 3) "Could not find the required static library BLOSC"
Here Prof. Ripley implies that blosc is not static on Linux. I don't think this is
the case. So I'm not sure how to proceed with this.

Thanks for the suggestion. I think you are right that it is safer to move the
check (target_unit < 0) up. And I agree that this should address the reported
undefined behaviour.

What is your system / your reference?  "Here" on Ubuntu libblosc* is set up
like thousands of other libraries: the shared library in the run-time
package, the static library in the -dev package.

Your build picks up the shared library as we'd expect:

$ ldd /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/blosc/libs/blosc.so | grep blosc
        libblosc.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libblosc.so.1 (0x00007f4b56501000)
$

To pick just one other package with compressors libraries:

$ ldd /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/zip/libs/zip.so | grep 'lib.*z'
        libzstd.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzstd.so.1 (0x000078af0e90f000)
        liblzma.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblzma.so.5 (0x000078af0e8cf000)
        libbz2.so.1.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbz2.so.1.0 (0x000078af0e8bb000)
        libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x000078af0e89d000)
$

Now, it has become a little 'fashionable' to ship libraries with their CRAN
package and embed them, but the default is still to rely on established
system libraries:

$ ldd /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RPostgreSQL/libs/RPostgreSQL.so | grep libpq
        libpq.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpq.so.5 (0x000071fe7fc53000)
$ ldd /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RPostgres/libs/RPostgres.so | grep libpq
        libpq.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpq.so.5 (0x000072e718fd6000)
$

Maybe Prof Ripley wanted you to play along the common theme of relying on an
external shared library?  For libblosc the default (as seen from `pkgconf`
aka `pkg-config`) appears to be standard linking just as we saw above:

$ pkgconf --libs blosc
-lblosc 
$ 

Hope this helps,  Dirk

To the extent it's generally helpful, I have seen this for 3 packages during checking on winbuilder this week. Each with submissions during the late afternoon EST. Something may be stalling and resetting.

With Ben's tip to look at the list with foghorn, there does seem to be a small queue that gets stuck, so it's likely not package specific.

And, as with Spencer's experience, resubmitting later gives the normal response.

It's clearly intermittent, so resubmitting a few hours later seems to be a reliable response for now.

Best,
Chris

Hi, Ben:


Thanks for this. I've added "foghorn::winbuilder_queue()" to my routine
script ;-)


AND I restarted the ones I couldn't find, and they all completed as
expected.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] apparent infinite loop in GitHub Action on a tiny
 package
Message-ID: <4d299816-aa17-43c0-ab0d-da62d9f773c4@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


GitHub Action has been running on 5 platforms for over a half hour on a 
tiny package:


https://github.com/sbgraves237/SS4Maddison


I'm trying to follow the current recommendation in Wickham and Bryan, R 
Packages.[1] I just added ~R/MaddisonProjectData.R, documenting data 
objects I have yet to add to the package, attempting to follow the 
instructions in R Packages, section 7.1.2 Documenting datasets.[2]


Then "devtools::load_all()" on my local computer put R into an apparent 
infinite loop.[3] After breaking out of that, I managed to replicate the 
behavior on 5 platforms on GitHub Action.


What do you suggest?
Thanks,
Spencer Graves

You can cancel Github actions.  I'd recommend cancelling 4 of the 5, and 
letting the 5th run for longer.

Several of them are stuck just after "* checking for sufficient/correct 
file permissions ... OK".  I think the next test should be "checking 
whether package ?foo? can be installed ...", so it looks like there are 
installation problems.  Whether those are problems in the package or 
problems at Github I couldn't tell you.

You're doing one strange thing:  the only code in the package is

   devtools::load_all()

in the single .R file.  That's a weird thing to do.

Hi, Duncan:


That's not just weird, it's the source of the infinite loop.


Please excuse me for taking your time with this.


Thanks very much. Spencer Graves

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] "Warning: replacing previous import" in reverse
 dependencies
Message-ID: <CAMMJQ0bVib=T1YO-Wn-_mMVP3c3sLWgTuf+jUPSWw4wEGVJ3qQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to understand/fix the reverse dependency warnings I get with
the new version of my maxLik package (see
https://github.com/arne-henningsen/maxLik).   For a number of packages,
e.g. for censReg, I get a warning:

Warning: replacing previous import ?maxLik::nobs? by ?stats::nobs? when
loading ?censReg?

I think this is related to the fact that the new version of maxLik imports
the S4 version of nobs, instead of miscTools' nObs.  The relevant part of
the NAMESPACE is

...
importFrom("stats4", "nobs")
...

However, censReg imports the S3 version after importing maxLik (it's
NAMESPACE):

...
import( "maxLik" )
...
importFrom( "stats", "nobs" )
...

(I may be wrong with my interpretation though.)

Is it something that I should address, or is it an issue with censReg
package in this case?  I can get the warning to go away if I re-order the
imports in censReg (generic nobs first, maxLik afterward).

Any enlightenment appreciated :-)

Message-ID: <AM8PR10MB466091CF9CC73E6A1D7A4DACA70CA@AM8PR10MB4660.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi all,

A CRAN check report after a manual inspection confuses me a bit. Hopefully someone can help me interpret. I received the following feedback based on M1mac checks:

_"He really should not be recommending Brew for macOS ... Since it does not log the configure output, issues such as misusing CFLAGS are suppressed (a usual 'anticonf' failing)."_

I use a modified 'anticonf' (by Jeroen Ooms) configure script. When a specific header file (blosc.h) is not found, an error is produced and the submitted version echos the suggestion to install the library with Brew. I know this is not the preferred method for linking to binaries on MacOS. I have already adjusted it to suggest the preferred method for setting this up (using https://mac.R-project.org/bin/install.R). So this should take care of the first part of the feedback.

I'm confused about the second part of the feedback. Is it related to the first part? Or is it a completely separate issue? If it is a completely separate issue, how am I misusing CFLAGS?

Latest version of my configure script is available here: <https://github.com/pepijn-devries/blosc/blob/d43b95fa3ba5c01efa11ffcf14ddfa3fca63988e/configure>

Any assistance is much appreciated!

Kind regards,

Pepijn

 R packages
Message-ID: <9867D356-133A-45D1-AE8E-6CCFDF3D653D@icloud.com>

I would like to release my R code under GPL-3. The code depends on a package (lme4) that itself uses "GPL >= 2", but which has upstream dependencies (minqa, numDeriv, rbibutils) that are GPL-2 only.  According to what I've read (see below), GPL-2 and GPL-3 are incompatible. Are the GPL-2 upstream licenses a problem for my GPL-3 R code? If so, are there recommended ways of resolving this?

This post is written from the perspective of an R-package user. I am not an R-package developer nor a lawyer. I want to comply with the software licenses with the best available understanding about the topic I have.

How did I found the issue: I built a container image from my code, then I ran:

write.csv(installed.packages(fields = "License")[,c(1,10)], "Licenses-of-R-packages.csv")

After inspecting the above list I found out that the lme4, central to my code, imports the minqa package. The lme4 is licensed under the "GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (? 2)]" according to CRAN, and the minqa package under "GPL-2". Thus, there might be a license incompatibility. The GPL2 vs GPL3 incompatibility is stated for example here:

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#v2v3Compatibility

Also if you select both the GPL2 and GPL3 licenses in the following license tool, it says they are incompatible:

https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/

Here is one of the graphs trying to simplify the license relations. Notice that there is no downstream-compatibility arrow from the GPLv2 to the GPLv2+.

https://dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html

Here is another figure lacking the compatibility arrow. On the other hand, there is no red arrow or cross either. The compatibility graph was obtained from the: "Georgia M. Kapitsaki, Nikolaos D. Tselikas, Ioannis E. Foukarakis: An insight into license tools for open source software systems. Journal of Systems and Software 102: 72-87 (2015)".

https://gkapi.blogspot.com/2016/09/foss-license-compatibilities.html?m=1

The main question is: are there incompatibilities between the upper stream GPL2 and lower stream "GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (? 2)]" R packages (minqa vs lme4)? If so, how could I deal with the situation as an R-package user trying to publish my source code under the GPL3? Or could the issue be solved by removing the minqa-based bobyqa optimiser from the lme4 package (a solution not directly in my hands)?

Lme4 also suggests the GPL2 numDeriv, is this an issue as well? Furthermore, it is notable how the R package installations also install the undirect dependencies by default, even if my code works without them, complicating the topic further. For example, if I rely on an R package licensed to me with GPL3, after the installation my setup (computer or a container image) can be full of other and possibly non-complying R packages. One of them being the GPL2 licensed rbibutils, which becomes installed with the lme4, but the CRAN page of the lme4 does not mention this as a direct dependency.

My understanding is that the licenses of other packages are only 
relevant if you are incorporating their code into yours and would like 
to release the combined work.

If your code uses some other package but you are not distributing the 
other package then their license doesn't affect your package.

For example, many packages (including R itself) are written to use 
Windows functions, but since they don't distribute copies of those 
functions the fact that Windows isn't open source doesn't matter.

Pepijn,

the comment points out three somewhat separate issues:

a) recommending brew is generally not a good idea especially for something as lightweight (brew tends to cause conflicts with the system) - not that it prevents people from doing it ;)

b) the test doesn?t log the compiler call, so it doesn't show the actual compiler invocation with flags - which is crucial to be able to say where the problem lies on error

c) the test uses incomplete flags - it fails to include CXXFLAGS in the test (I assume that is the CFLAGS comment, but if not sure you can ask for clarification).

Looking at the file I see another problem as well - this fallback is most certainly wrong:

  for pre in /usr /usr/X11 /usr/X11R6 /usr/local /opt /opt/R/arm64 opt/R/x86_64 /sw; do

I don?t think you should use headers from another platform and/or hard-code them (I?m looking the the two odd "/opt/R/arm64" and "opt/R/x86_64" entires). Also unclear why the latter is missing leading slash? At the moment you can get away with something like /opt/R/$(uname -m), but technically the architecture may be defined by ${R_ARCH} instead, although we avoided using it recently, because people often ignore it and then it causes issues. (I principle this is moot, since if you have any of those, then they should be on the PATH so likely it is a user error to start with).

Cheers,
Simon

When a specific header file (blosc.h) is not found, an error is produced and the submitted version echos the suggestion to install the library with Brew. I know this is not the preferred method for linking to binaries on MacOS. I have already adjusted it to suggest the preferred method for setting this up (using https://mac.R-project.org/bin/install.R). So this should take care of the first part of the feedback.

Hi, Duncan:


That's not just weird, it's the source of the infinite loop.


Please excuse me for taking your time with this.


Thanks very much. Spencer Graves

The error is pointing you to 4:30, which is line 4 character 30. If you look at that, you have typed "" instead of ". As such, you have a new string opened which is never closed.

Thank you for the input.

I have seen the same interpretation earlier, and it feels logical and intuitive to me as well. However, there is a lot of opposing opinions to it in different contexts of programming. For example, see the below question-answer, where the Free Software Foundation itself is also cited:

https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/9085/can-i-distribute-non-gpl-code-that-uses-gpl-code-as-long-as-i-dont-distribute-m

I think that the software aggregate is one central concept when considering the question: whether an R code/package using other R packages can be distributed without GPL "leaking" from one entity to another. Below is a link to the Free Software Foundation's interpretations about the aggregates. What do you think about these, how do they apply for the cases where GPL2+ or GPL3 -licensed R code calls GPL2package::function()? Or the installation of GPL2+ or GPL3 -licensed R package also installs a GPL2package? 

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation

Does the "shared address space" cover the typical case in R, where both my R code and the R package it loaded can access the same variable in the working memory? If so, then the Free Software Foundation seems to interpreter them as a single program, not an aggregate. And if the LGPL licenses are not used (allowing dynamic linking without the leakage, which is the default with R packages to my understanding), then the GPL licenses start to leak across R codes/packages. To my understanding.

This might also be useful to look at:

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLPlugins

I am not familiar with Windows functions. But my gut feeling says that they are considered as separate entity, if standard command-line communication or similar is used (see the above link). The below lecture, from a real open-source legal expert, is titled for corporates, but the principles are the same. I link directly to the point where she discuss about the differences between the GPL and LGPL licenses. Soon after that she discusses how the operating system and its functionalities are considered as separate entity from the other software (with certain conditions).

Hi Simon,

Thank you for the clarifications. I changed my setup from anticonf to autoconf. I think this will address a few of the issues, I think it now logs compilation errors more clearly. I'm also no longer relying on brew, nor suggesting it.

I will also update the searching path on MacOS, when pkg-config fails, and not hardcode the architecture as you suggested.

Cheers,

Pepijn

?
Pepijn,

the comment points out three somewhat separate issues:

a) recommending brew is generally not a good idea especially for something as lightweight (brew tends to cause conflicts with the system) - not that it prevents people from doing it ;)

b) the test doesn?t log the compiler call, so it doesn't show the actual compiler invocation with flags - which is crucial to be able to say where the problem lies on error

c) the test uses incomplete flags - it fails to include CXXFLAGS in the test (I assume that is the CFLAGS comment, but if not sure you can ask for clarification).

Looking at the file I see another problem as well - this fallback is most certainly wrong:

? for pre in /usr /usr/X11 /usr/X11R6 /usr/local /opt /opt/R/arm64 opt/R/x86_64 /sw; do

I don?t think you should use headers from another platform and/or hard-code them (I?m looking the the two odd "/opt/R/arm64" and "opt/R/x86_64" entires). Also unclear why the latter is missing leading slash? At the moment you can get away with something like /opt/R/$(uname -m), but technically the architecture may be defined by ${R_ARCH} instead, although we avoided using it recently, because people often ignore it and then it causes issues. (I principle this is moot, since if you have any of those, then they should be on the PATH so likely it is a user error to start with).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] 2 Generic functions with the same name-skeleton
Message-ID: <DBAP192MB095638DDCA4324484071E42F8409A@DBAP192MB0956.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear All,

I have some problems and some questions regarding how to pass some checks (run on my computer - new version not yet submitted).

There are 2 important notes:

1. Note 1:
checking S3 generic/method consistency ... NOTE
  Apparent methods for exported generics not registered:
    centres.ppRoll

2. Note 2:
checking Rd \usage sections ... NOTE
  S3 methods shown with full name in Rd file 'centres.ppRoll.Rd':
    'centres.ppRoll'

The current code is on GitHub:
https://github.com/discoleo/Rpdb

But let me first explain the reason and reasoning.

There are 2 generic functions: centres and centres.ppRoll, each with 3 methods for pdb objects, atoms and coords (default).

Generic function centres:
The 1st generic function, centres, computes the centres of a molecule and has methods for 3 objects: pdb molecule, atoms and xyz-coordinates (default). It acts on an object of type coords, while the objects atoms and pdb include such a coords-object in their structure.

I would like to write various "specialised" versions:
- they still compute the centre, as it's the simplest summary possible for 3D objects;
- however, there are many types of molecules: proteins, nucleic acids, other types of molecules; and each may benefit from more "specialised" methods;
Note: all molecules are still coded as a pdb object. It's the user who selects which method is most appropriate for a specific situation/molecule.

E.g. proteins consist of long linear chains. One such variant would be a "rolling mean": it makes sense for polypeptide chains and nucleic acids, but little (or no) sense for other molecules.

I wrote therefore a generic function centres.ppRoll with 3 methods for the 3 base-objects.

I would like to reuse the centres-skeleton for the name: users can then easily check which methods are available to compute centres:
methods(centres)
# [1] centres.atoms          centres.coords         centres.pdb
# centres.ppRoll
# [5] centres.ppRoll.atoms   centres.ppRoll.default centres.ppRoll.pdb

I would like to avoid having hundreds of function names which no-one remembers and which would be cumbersome to search for. Each method would be useful only in particular situations and users are likely to forget the exact names between uses.

I get the above 2 notes with this approach:
- I did not register centres.ppRoll as an S3 method to avoid the 2nd note;
- I get the 2nd note anyway (and it gets silently registered, which may be necessary for the methods-search to work);

Another pseudo-solution would be to add a methods argument. This solution is misused at times; unfortunately, it is really ugly here because some of the methods may have particular arguments (e.g. window-size for the roll-method).

Ultimately, I may end up with 50 or 100 arguments in the function, which I also need to replicate to all the 3 methods (pdb, atoms, default/coords).

I really don't like this pseudo-solution and prefer one based on the 1st approach.

I did not count how many function name variants are in the > 20,000 packages on CRAN. But I think that a more structured approach would be beneficial to everyone.

Thanks in advance for any support,

Leonard

### Note
- Proteins have a backbone and the amino-acids also have side chains;

- The initial developer of Rpdb used it mainly for other types of molecules (not proteins);

The code actually functions:

setwd(...)
x = read.pdb("pdb2z81.ent")
# Number of models:  0
# Warning message:
# In read.pdb("pdb2z81.ent") : The pdb contains a Caveat record!
tmp = centres.ppRoll(x)
visualize(x, type="p", pbc.box = FALSE)
# Draw a peptide-"Skeleton"
lines3d(tmp, lwd = 5, col = "red")

# A new version of the pdb-format is also out,

I feel as though it would be best to just rename the function to
centres_ppRoll

The _safest_ (possibly overly strict) assumption is that your package
is a derived work of your GPL-2 dependencies even when they are not
direct but transitive (which is the position taken by GPL FAQ), which
necessitates licensing your code under GPL >= 2.

This is not the only possibility. You could make various arguments that
would let you keep your code licensed under GPL-3.0-only (e.g. does your
GPL-3 code work even with the GPL-2 dependency uninstalled? do other
non-GPL2 libraries implement the same interface?), but whether they are
valid in your specific case, only a lawyer who specialises in software
can say.

This is my belief too, and I've written a bit about it at

Ilmari,

there is a huge difference between opinions and law. Many of the statements your quoted are just opinions, they are not legally binding - in fact if you research the legal area you will find that they are often considered incompatible with the wording of the license (i.e., it has been argued that the courts are unlikely to take those views). However, none of these statements have been tested in court (AFAIK), so there is no definitive answer. The simple answer to your question is: consult your lawyer. It really makes no sense to speculate on your own unless you are very familiar with the law and legal system. You have already heard the view of the R community (in short namespaces create APIs and R is interpreted, so use is not derivation) for what it?s worth (it isn?t legally binding, either, but it explains what you see on CRAN), so you can take it or leave it, but you won?t get anything more definitive unless you seek legal advice (and even then you may not get a definitive answer, only an advice).

Cheers,
Simon

I tried to find a clear statement about the transitive case from the GPL FAQ without luck. By "transitive" did you mean distributing the code without the R packages the code depends on? Could you point out the part where the case was dealt with? I concluded it was not allowed, because the option was not separately mentioned, and because of the shared address space during the execution. Also the need for making the separate LGPL licenses affected my conclusion.

>  which necessitates licensing your code under GPL >= 2.

This would be a very easy option for me: instead of licensing my code with GPL3 only, I would use the GPL >= 2 option. Without the need of possibly removing all the GPL2-licensed dependencies, or ask the authors of the dependencies to update their licenses. It would probably also mean that there is not conflict between the GPL-2 | GPL-3 lme4 and GPL2 minqa packages either in the first place. But having basis for this option would also be good, such as explained by the free software foundation.

> You have already heard the view of the R community (in short namespaces create APIs and R is interpreted, so use is not derivation)

Simon, this is very interesting information and makes sense. If I understood correctly, no derivative work but an aggregate, the code entities are communicating through the well-documented APIs. Where was this community view actually stated, do you have any source for further information? If this aligns with the explanations of the free software foundation and thus GPL licenses, then I think there is no issues indeed.

I am very likely to ask about the topic from a software lawyer for my particular case. But to form educated questions, I first need to get some basic understanding, and also hear how the community thinks about these issues.

Hi Ilmari,

there is an important point to consider in order to have the big picture
before asking for legal advice: on whom is the burden of license
compatibility.

I first wrote a long example, but here is a LLM summary that I am
very satisfied of:

GPL?2?only and GPL?3 are not license?compatible when combined into a
single derivative work, but this is rarely an issue for developers who
only distribute source code ? private use is unrestricted, and separate
works can be redistributed side?by?side.

The problem arises when redistributing binaries or other combined
artefacts: if any binary contains code from both, it cannot be legally
redistributed.

This risk extends to container images: while a generic image bundling
many unrelated packages is usually fine, an image built to run two
incompatible?licensed components together could be considered a single
work, triggering the same restrictions.

So I think that the big question is not only on how you comply to
license terms, some of which you can chose as you are the copyright
holder, but also how your choices empower the downstream community to
comply.

Best,

Charles

I don?t think we should be trusting LLM output for questions like these.
The GPL FAQ directly addresses the bindings between interpreted code
modules (text, not binary) and the need for distribution of code under the
GPL to either be under the same version code or a compatible license.

Hi all,

Just adding my experience to this thread as a cautionary example against
the notion that it should be no problem to release a package under GPL-3 if
it only calls functions from packages released under GPL-2.

Up to 2017, my afex package (which depended on several GPL-2 packages) was
released under GPL-3. However, then an over-eager debian user reported this
as a violation of the GPL, see here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=800891
As a consequence, Debian suspended hosting the corresponding binary package
(r-cran-afex) until I changed my license to GPL (? 2).

I in principle agree with both Duncan and Hadley position, but if someone
more powerful (in this case the Debian package admin) has other opinions
there was not much I could do.

Best,
Henrik

Dear Iris,

Thank you very much for your response.

I finally found out how to do it.

I am using devtools with roxygen2 to build the package. My knowledge is very limited about this process. I think I've got it now: adding the following lines before the function code does the job, e.g.:

#' @method centres.ppRoll default
#' @exportS3Method centres.ppRoll default

I missed the first method-line and did not realise it.

Many thanks,

Leonard

I feel as though it would be best to just rename the function to centres_ppRoll

Dear All,

I have some problems and some questions regarding how to pass some checks (run on my computer - new version not yet submitted).

There are 2 important notes:

1. Note 1:
checking S3 generic/method consistency ... NOTE
  Apparent methods for exported generics not registered:
    centres.ppRoll

2. Note 2:
checking Rd \usage sections ... NOTE
  S3 methods shown with full name in Rd file 'centres.ppRoll.Rd':
    'centres.ppRoll'

The current code is on GitHub:
https://github.com/discoleo/Rpdb

But let me first explain the reason and reasoning.

There are 2 generic functions: centres and centres.ppRoll, each with 3 methods for pdb objects, atoms and coords (default).

Generic function centres:
The 1st generic function, centres, computes the centres of a molecule and has methods for 3 objects: pdb molecule, atoms and xyz-coordinates (default). It acts on an object of type coords, while the objects atoms and pdb include such a coords-object in their structure.

I would like to write various "specialised" versions:
- they still compute the centre, as it's the simplest summary possible for 3D objects;
- however, there are many types of molecules: proteins, nucleic acids, other types of molecules; and each may benefit from more "specialised" methods;
Note: all molecules are still coded as a pdb object. It's the user who selects which method is most appropriate for a specific situation/molecule.

E.g. proteins consist of long linear chains. One such variant would be a "rolling mean": it makes sense for polypeptide chains and nucleic acids, but little (or no) sense for other molecules.

I wrote therefore a generic function centres.ppRoll with 3 methods for the 3 base-objects.

I would like to reuse the centres-skeleton for the name: users can then easily check which methods are available to compute centres:
methods(centres)
# [1] centres.atoms          centres.coords         centres.pdb
# centres.ppRoll
# [5] centres.ppRoll.atoms   centres.ppRoll.default centres.ppRoll.pdb

I would like to avoid having hundreds of function names which no-one remembers and which would be cumbersome to search for. Each method would be useful only in particular situations and users are likely to forget the exact names between uses.

I get the above 2 notes with this approach:
- I did not register centres.ppRoll as an S3 method to avoid the 2nd note;
- I get the 2nd note anyway (and it gets silently registered, which may be necessary for the methods-search to work);

Another pseudo-solution would be to add a methods argument. This solution is misused at times; unfortunately, it is really ugly here because some of the methods may have particular arguments (e.g. window-size for the roll-method).

Ultimately, I may end up with 50 or 100 arguments in the function, which I also need to replicate to all the 3 methods (pdb, atoms, default/coords).

I really don't like this pseudo-solution and prefer one based on the 1st approach.

I did not count how many function name variants are in the > 20,000 packages on CRAN. But I think that a more structured approach would be beneficial to everyone.

Thanks in advance for any support,

Leonard

##########

### Note
- Proteins have a backbone and the amino-acids also have side chains;
- It is useful in certain situations to have additional types of centres computed;
- The initial developer of Rpdb used it mainly for other types of molecules (not proteins);

The code actually functions:

# pdb2z81.ent can be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank;
setwd(...)
x = read.pdb("pdb2z81.ent")
# Number of models:  0
# Warning message:
# In read.pdb("pdb2z81.ent") : The pdb contains a Caveat record!
tmp = centres.ppRoll(x)
visualize(x, type="p", pbc.box = FALSE)
# Draw a peptide-"Skeleton"
lines3d(tmp, lwd = 5, col = "red")

# A new version of the pdb-format is also out,
# but that's a horror-story in itself.
