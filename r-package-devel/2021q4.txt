Thanks! That looks relevant.

I think I have found the relevant source code in pandoc, and it seems it 
just calls Rscript without path. So it will probably call the dummy 
Rscript. Hmm, I'll have to think how to fix that.

It is probably good that R CMD check checks this as this could cause 
weird errors when people have multiple versions of R on their system.

Best,
Jan

I'm rethinking the interface of a package, specifically how external binary
data is formatted for use in R. I can't decide if it is better to use
attributes to store metadata or use a list to hold the main data and
metadata as separate elements.

Here's is what one datatype currently looks like:

List of 2
 $ : int [1:16, 1:16, 1:16] 9 9 9 9 10 10 1 1 14 14 ...
  ..- attr(*, "palette")=List of 16
 [snip]
 $ : int [1:16, 1:16, 1:16] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
  ..- attr(*, "palette")=List of 2
 [snip]
  - attr(*, "offset")= int 3

It's a list of two 16x16x16 arrays of integers. Each array has its own
"palette" attribute. Each value in the array refers to a specific element
of the palette. In addition the entire list has an offset attribute.

I am considering alternative strategies for representing this data, and I
would like any opinions on which style is recommended and why?

List of 3
 $ index  :List of 2
  ..$ : int [1:16, 1:16, 1:16] 9 9 9 9 10 10 1 1 14 14 ...
  ..$ : int [1:16, 1:16, 1:16] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ palette:List of 2
  ..$ :List of 16
  ..$ :LIST of 2
 $ offset : int 3

or

List of 2
 $ :List of 2
  ..$ index: int [1:16, 1:16, 1:16] 9 9 9 9 10 10 1 1 14 14 ...
  ..$ palette:List of 16
 $ : List of 2
 ..$ index : int [1:16, 1:16, 1:16] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 ..$ palette : List of 2
 - attr(*, "offset")= int 3

Thanks.

Is the object like some other common R object?  You say it's a 16x16x16 
array of integers.  Is there an advantage to treating it *exactly* like 
that, so x[1,2,3] gives an integer?  Then put the other stuff in attributes.

Is it weird enough that x[1,2,3] *needs* to look at the other attributes 
to know what to return?  Does it never make sense to do regular 
operations on the object, as though it really was 16x16x16 array of 
integers?  Then make it a list of different components, and spend the 
time to define methods to handle any operations that do make sense.

Both approaches are possible; you want to choose the one that is 
easiest, and most maintainable.

Duncan has used the phrase "do regular operations on the object" to divide the use cases and emphasized that needing the attributes might be important, but he did not come out and remind you that if you _do_ perform regular operations on it then the outputs of those operations are likely to lose the attributes, which is why you might want to avoid relying on them if that is an issue for your class use cases.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Formula modeling
Message-ID: <000401d7bbc1$2274c840$675e58c0$@gmail.com>

Dear R-package-devel subscribers,

 

My question concerns a package design issue relating to the usage of
formulas.

 

I am interested in describing via formulas systems of the form:

 

d = p + x + y 

s = p + w + y

p = z + y

q = min(d,s).

 

The context in which I am working is that of market models with, primarily,
panel data. In the above system, one may think of the first equation as
demand, the second as supply, and the third as an equation (co-)determining
prices. The fourth equation is implicitly used by the estimation method, and
it does not need to be specified when programming the R formula. If you need
more information bout the system, you may check the package diseq.
Currently, I am using constructors to build market model objects. In a
constructor call, I pass [i] the right-hand sides of the first three
equations as strings, [ii] an argument indicating whether the equations of
the system have correlated shocks, [iii] the identifiers of the used dataset
(one for the subjects of the panel and one for time), and [iv] the quantity
(q) and price (p) variables. These four arguments contain all the necessary
information for constructing a model.

 

I would now like to re-implement model construction using formulas, which
would be a more regular practice for most R users. I am currently
considering passing all the above information with a single formula of the
form:

 

q | p | subject | time | rho ~ p + x + y | p + w + y | z + y 

 

where subject and time are the identifiers, and rho indicates whether
correlated or independent shocks should be used.

 

I am unaware of other packages that use formulas in this way (for instance,
passing the identifiers in the formula), and I wonder if this would go
against any good practices. Would it be better to exclude some of the
necessary elements for constructing the model? This might make the resuting
formulas more similar to those of models with multiple responses or multiple
parts. I am not sure, though, how one would use such model formulas without
all the relevant information. Is there any suggested design alternative that
I could check?

 

I would appreciate any suggestions and discussion!

 

Kind regards,

Pantelis

I am responding to a subset of what you asked.  There are packages which use multiple formulas
in their argument sequence.


What you have as a single formula with | as a separator
q | p | subject | time | rho ~ p + x + y | p + w + y | z + y 
I think would be better as a comma-separated list of formulas

q , p , subject , time , rho ~ p + x + y , p + w + y , z + y 

because in R notation | is usually an operator, not a separator.

lattice uses formulas and the | is used as a conditioning operator.

nlme and lme4 can have multiple formulas in the same calling sequence.

lme4 is newer.  from its ?lme4-package
?lme4? covers approximately the same ground as the earlier ?nlme?
     package.

lme4 should probably be the modelyou are looking for for the package design.

I don't work with models like this, but I would find it more natural to 
express the multiple formulas in a list:

   list(d ~ p + x + y, s ~ p + w + y, p ~ z + y)

I'd really have no idea how either of the proposals below should be parsed.

Of course, if people working with models like this are used to working 
with notation like yours, that would be a strong argument to use your 
notation.

   There's a Formula package on CRAN 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Formula/index.html> that's 
designed for this use case.

   lme4 and nlme don't use it, but implement their own formula 
manipulation machinery. (The cleanest version of this machinery is 
actually in glmmTMB at 
https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/blob/master/glmmTMB/R/reformulas.R .)

   I would probably recommend Duncan's or Richard's approach, but if you 
want to keep your original syntax then the Formula package is probably 
the way to go.

There's a disadvantage to this proposal.  I'd assume that "p" means the 
same in all 3 formulas, but with the notation I give, it could refer to 
3 unrelated variables, because each of the formulas would have its own 
environment, and they could all be different.  I guess you could make it 
a requirement that they all use the same environment, but that's likely 
going to be confusing to users, who won't know what it means.

Another possibility that wouldn't have this problem (but in my opinion 
is kind of ugly) is to use R vector construction notation:

   c(d, s, p) ~ c(p + x + y, p + w + y, z + y)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] multithreading in packages
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.22.394.2110072149150.2405@iridium>


  I am considering adding multithreading support in my package, and would 
appreciate any suggestions/comments/opinions on what is the right way to 
do this.

   * My understanding from reading documentation and source code is that 
there is no dedicated support in R yet, but there are packages that use 
multithreading. Are there any plans for multithreading support in future R 
versions ?

   * pthread or openmp ? I am particularly concerned about interaction with 
other packages. I have seen that using pthread and openmp libraries 
simultaneously can result in incorrectly pinned threads.

   * control of maximum number of threads. One can default to openmp 
environment variable, but these might vary between openmp implementations.

thank you very much

Vladimir Dergachev

Hi,

The different environments can potentially be an issue in the future. I was not aware of the vector construction notation, and I think this is what I was mainly looking for. 

I could provide two initialization methods. One will use the ugly vector notation that one could use to bind the whole model with a particular environment. The second can be more user-friendly and use the comma-separated list of formulas. Essentially, the second will prepare the vector formula and call the first initialization method.

The (|) operator comment makes sense, and I would also want to avoid this to the extent that it is feasible.  So, I am currently thinking something along the line:

c(d, s, p | subject | time) ~ c(p + x + y, p + w + y, z + y)

This is very similar to how the function ?lme4::lmer uses the bar to separate expressions for design matrices from grouping factors. Actually, the subject and time variables are needed for subsetting prices for various operations required for the model matrix. 

Thanks for the suggestions; they are very helpful!

Best,
Pantelis

I wonder if there is a way to write something along the lines of

A quick experiment with R shows that this is treated like a formula, so ~c 
becomes a way to group formulas.

Shared memory multithreading is hard to get right in a memory-safe
language (e.g. R), but there's the parallel package, which is a part of
base R, which offers process-based parallelism and may run your code on
multiple machines at the same time. There's no communication _between_
these machines, though. (But I think there's an MPI package on CRAN.)

pthreads-based code could be harder to run on Windows (which is a
first-class platform for R, expected to be supported by most packages).
OpenMP should be cross-platform, but Apple compilers are sometimes
lacking; the latest Apple likely has been solved since I've heard about
it. If your problem can be made embarrassingly parallel, you're welcome
to use the parallel package.

Moreover, CRAN-facing tests aren't allowed to consume more than 200%
CPU, so it's a good idea to leave the number of workers in control of
the user. According to a reference guide I got from openmp.org, OpenMP
implementations are expected to understand omp_set_num_threads() and
the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.

R uses mingw on windows, and mingw supports pthreads, you don't need
to do anything special on Windows. You don't even need a
`Makevars`/`Makevars.win` or configure* file just for using pthreads.

Some CRAN packages do this, you can search here:
https://github.com/search?l=C&p=5&q=org%3Acran+pthread_create&type=Code
(Some of these are from Unix-specific code, but not all.)

Message-ID: <CAMu=eMCwhwBN4H3=+X=Dw0Af-wHff2fO82jbY2aaXukyzQ+GXw@mail.gmail.com>

[CROSSPOST from glmmTMB issue #767
https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/767]

Hi devel list,

I recently noticed that a vignette is missing a couple of equations when
installed from CRAN and when displayed by CRAN. The code renders as
expected with the equations when I knit it on my own computer. The lines
that do not render on CRAN are the following:

\begin{equation}
g(\boldsymbol{\mu}) = \boldsymbol{X\beta} + \boldsymbol{Zb}
\end{equation}


<!-- -->
\begin{align}
g(\boldsymbol{\mu}) &= \boldsymbol{X\beta} + \boldsymbol{Z(I_n \otimes
\Lambda)b} \\
&= \boldsymbol{X\beta} + \boldsymbol{Zb_{new}}
\end{align}
<!-- -->

Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution?
Can you suggest where to notify CRAN of this bug?

The missing equations should be in section "General latent variable model"
here
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/vignettes/covstruct.html

cheers,
Mollie

Well, the way I planned to use multitheading is to speedup processing of 
very large vectors, so one does not have to wait seconds for the command 
to return. Same could be done for many built-in R primitives.

G?bor Cs?rdi pointed out that R is compiled with mingw on Windows and 
has pthread support - something I did not know either.

I used parallel before, it is very nice, but R-level only. I am looking 
for something to speedup response of individual package functions so they 
themselves can be used of part of more complicated code.

Oh, this would never be run through CRAN tests, it is meant for data that 
is too big for CRAN.

I seem to remember that the Intel compiler used a different environmental 
variable, but it could be this was fixed since the last time I used it.

Useful link ! I also did a search for cran+omp and this turned up some 
packages as well.

Looks like both openmp and pthreads are used in packages that passed CRAN 
checks.

Keep in mind that by embedding this decision into your package you may be consuming a resource (cores) that may be more efficiently allocated by an application-level partitioning. of available resources. I for one am not a fan of this kind of thinking, and it makes system requirements for your package more complex even if you allow me to disable it.

Those display equations aren't in the vignette I see if I call 
browseVignettes("glmmTMB").

Looking in the tarball, I don't see them in

   inst/doc/covstruct.html

Are you sure they were in the file that you submitted?  I suspect this 
is a problem in the way you built the tarball, rather than a bug at CRAN.

That's right, and this is why I was asking about any present or future 
plans for R support - if there was a way to find out how many threads R 
should use, I would use that.

So far, it looks like the most portable way is to use OpenMP and let the 
user set an appropriate environment variable if they want to restrict 
thread usage. I could use the same OpenMP variable for pthreads as well.

This is pretty common on clusters anyway, with openmp environment 
variables set automatically to the number of cores user requested.

I would probably also add a function to the package to report the number 
of threads being used. Not sure whether it would be a good idea to report 
this during package loading (and not sure what is the right way to display 
a message during package load either).

   FWIW there is some machinery in the glmmTMB package for querying,

One thing I did not see mentioned in this thread (pun intended) so far:

For what kind of computations is multithreading supposed to be used within the package being developed? If the computations involve a lot of linear/matrix algebra, then one could just use R with other linear algebra routines (e.g., OpenBLAS, Atlas, MKL, BLIS) and get the performance benefits of multicore processing of those computations without having to change a single line of code in the package (although in my experience, most of the performance benefits come from switching to something like OpenBLAS and using it single-threaded).

This aside, I am personally more in favor of explicitly parallelizing those things that are known to be embarrassingly parallelizable using packages like parallel, future, etc. since a package author should know best when these situations arise and can take the necessary steps to parallelize those computations -- but making the use of parallel processing in these cases an option, not a default. I have seen way too many cases in HPC environments where jobs are being parallelized, the package is doing parallel processing, and multicore linear algebra routines are being used all simultaneously, which is just a disaster.

Finally, I don't think the HPC task view has been mentioned so far:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html

(not even by Dirk just now, who maintains it!)

Best,
Wolfgang

This is meant for the RMVL package, which memory maps MVL format files for 
direct access. The package also provides database functionality.

The files I am interested in are large. For example, the Gaia DR3 dataset 
is 500GB+.

Plain linear algebra will likely not need multithreading - the computation 
will proceed at the speed of storage I/O (which is quite impressive 
nowadays).

But it will be useful to multithread more involved code that builds or 
queries indices, and I was also thinking of some functions to assist with 
visualization - plot() and xyplot() were not meant for very long vectors.

Ideally, one would be able to explore such large data sets interactively.
And then do more interesting things on the cluster.

Thanks for the link !

I see there is an OpenCL package, very interesting.

Have you thought about using C or c++, please?  Also, there are packages
called pbdDMAT from Drew Schmidt at U of Tenn which might help.

Yes, indeed, the core of the package is written in C, with some C++ for 
sorting (which turned out to be rather interesting).

Beyound writing optimized C there are two ways to speed up execution on a 
single computer - multithreading and vector instructions.

Multithreading is easier here, because only one or two libraries are 
needed (libgomp or pthread) and because it is often hard to vectorize 
operations like sorting, hashing and the like.

Also, to use vector instructions to full potential one typically needs a 
fair bit of black magic which is unlikely to pass CRAN tests. I am having

Great, thanks for pointing this out ! Looks like pbdDMAT uses mpi.

Also, it appears this package was removed from CRAN for failing to compile 
on macs, which seems rather unfair - I don't know of any clusters running 
mac os.

Yes it does use MPI.  You can get the pbd from GitHub, as a backup.

Thanks

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] which functions to deprecate
Message-ID: <CAJuCY5zYavOjbrgxxu_-Nsr8o1gAUrZk=yKBwunZ-sWThCpN0w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a package with a legacy main function which calls a few exported
functions. In practice most users will only call the main function. Should
I deprecate only the main function or all the legacy functions? The latter
case generates more deprecation warnings when calling the main function.

I'd say you should deprecate all the functions you intend to stop 
exporting two releases from now, i.e. they'll all be deprecated in
the next release, and defunct in the release after that.

If you find that calling the main function generates too many messages, 
then you could leave the others undeprecated for now, and deprecate them 
when you finally mark the main one as defunct (or delete it).  That is:

next release:  main is deprecated
next+1 release: main is defunct, others are deprecated
next+2 release: all are defunct

Alternatively, you could deprecate all of them now, but edit the main 
one so it suppresses the deprecation messages in the others. 
Deprecation messages are documented to have class "deprecatedWarning", 
so you can suppress only those messages if you work at it.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How does one install a libtool generated libfoo.so.1
 file into ./libs/?
Message-ID: <a170c691-3074-cabe-fcc8-8805ca66544e@uconn.edu>

Hi folks,

My package [1] depends on a C library libghmm-dev that's available in 
many GNU/Linux package managers.  However, it's not available on all 
platforms and if this dependency is not installed, my autoconf generated 
configure script defaults to falling back to compiling and installing 
the dependency from my bundled copy of upstream's pristine source 
tarball [2].  Now, because upstream uses automake which in turn uses 
libtool, I also use automake and libtool in my build process to hook 
into their build artifacts using SUBDIRS and *-local automake rules [3].

As you may know libtool appends `-version-info` to its generated shared 
libraries in the form "libfoo.so.1.2.3".  I'm linking against the 
bundled library which only sets the first value, namely libghmm.so.1.

The trouble is, R's installation process will only copy compiled files 
from ./libs/ that have exactly the extension ".so" and files ending with 
".so.1" are ignored.

My current workaround is to set -Wl,-rpath to the location of the 
generated ".so.1" file.  This allows the installation process to 
complete and sneakily pass the 2 canonical tests:


** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
---snip---
** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location


However, not surprisingly, when I try to load the library from the final 
location after the temporary directory has been deleted it fails with:


library(tsshmm)
...
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'tsshmm' indyn.load(file, 
DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
  unable to load shared object 
'/home/omsai/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1/tsshmm/libs/tsshmm.so':
   libghmm.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


I can rename the dependency from ".so.1" to ".so" to also get the 
dependent library to the final location.  But it still fails with the 
above error because the library links against the ".so.1" file and I 
would need an accompanying symlink.  I tried creating a symlink but 
can't think of how to get the symlink to the final location.  If my 
Makefile writes the symlink into ./inst/libs/libghmm.so.1 during compile 
time it is not actually installed; perhaps because the ./inst/ 
sub-directories are only copied earlier on when staging and are ignored 
later?  If I were to create that dangling symlink inside ./inst/libs/ 
instead of generating it later during compile time, devtools::install() 
complains about the broken symlink with:


cp: cannot stat 'tsshmm/inst/libs/libghmm.so.1': No such file or directory


So is there some mechanism to copy arbitrary files or symlinks to the 
final install location?  I prefer not to patch upstreams Makefile.am to 
remove their -version-info, but currently that's the only option I can 
think of.  I can't find helpful discussion surrounding this in the 
mailing list archives.

Last week when I've posted for help with my package on another issue on 
the Bioconductor mailing list, one adventurous soul tried installing the 
package using `remotes::install_gitlab("coregenomics/tsshmm")`.  This 
won't work because I haven't committed the generated autotools files; if 
anyone wants to play with it, you'll have to follow the 2 additional 
steps run by the continuous integration script, namely, unpacking 
./src/ghmm-0.9-rc3.tar.gz into ./src/ and running `autoreconf -ivf` in 
the package's top-level directory where configure.ac is located.

Any help appreciated,

Pariksheet

[2] The only patches I apply to the dependency are to fix 2 bugs for 
compiling, and to remedy a warning severe enough to be flagged by `R CMD 
check`.

It turns out removing -version-info or setting it to 0.0.0 will still 
try to link against libghmm.so.0 which is still problematic.  I don't 
see how to disable libtool's versioning.

So after playing around, the only way I can think of doing is is 
eliminating the dependency file by compiling it statically and linking 
it with the dynamic library, because when I try merging the 2 dynamic 
libraries with libtool it gives the same error of not finding 
"libghmm.so.1".  I have a patch that works on my Debian machines, but 
not yet on the Ubuntu CI Image:

Good day,

I would like to create a concise show method for an S4 class that I am developing. One class slot stores a function specified by the end user. It could be a basic function, an S3 function, an S4 function. For S4 functions, I can get a concise representation:

> capture.output(showMethods(limmaSelection))[1]
[1] "Function: limmaSelection (package ClassifyR)"

If the user specified the function bdiag from Matrix, how could I generalise the show code to describe the function, such that the output would be "Function bdiag from package Matrix" and simiarly for an S3 function?

The simplest thing to try is to compile the library statically and link it 
into your package. No extra files - no trouble.

You can also try renaming the file from *.so.1 to *.so.

Hi all,

I have a question re package submission that I'm hoping someone might be able to help with.

A package I maintain (dalmatian) was archived last year because one of the packages it depends on (dglm) was removed from CRAN. The dglm package has been fixed and is back on CRAN, and I have resubmitted my package. There have been no changes to my package and I resubmitted the same version with the same version number. I noted this in my submission.

All checks passed, but I received the following from log CRAN-pretest:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: CRAN incoming feasibility, Result: WARNING
  Maintainer: 'Simon Bonner simon.bonner at uwo.ca<mailto:simon.bonner at uwo.ca>'

  New submission

  Package was archived on CRAN

  Insufficient package version (submitted: 0.6.1, existing: 0.6.1)

  CRAN repository db overrides:
    X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2020-10-18 as requires archived package
      'dglm'.

  This build time stamp is over a month old.

It seems that I am not allowed to submit the package with the same version, but  it also seems odd to increment the version to get around this when nothing at all has changed in the package.

Is there another solution?

Thanks,

Simon

I would just increment the version.? This is the from the CRAN
re-submission policy[1]:

> Updates to previously-published packages must have an increased version. Increasing the version number at each submission reduces confusion so is preferred even when a previous submission was not accepted.

You could always add NEWS entry explaining what the new version
is, then the package will not be exactly the same anymore ;).

Best,

B.

Thanks,

Thank you both for your suggestions!  I will link the code statically 
with PIC per your consensus.

I found when linking the R package library, one also has to link the 
dependencies of the static library; in this case libghmm depends on 
libxml-2.0 > 2.6 and so I have to link libxml2 to my R package library 
after finding libxml2 with pkg-config.


Thanks for the quick replies,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] failing S3 dispatch
Message-ID: <de55d0d0-6c1d-f9a4-3320-9a176afb8848@truecluster.com>

I didn't find an answer elsewhere:

My package 'bit' creates a S3 generic 'clone' and exports it. 
Furthermore it registers a S3 method 'clone.default' (not exported).

My package 'ff' imports package 'bit' and exports and registers a new S3 
method 'clone.ff'. However, calling 'clone(ffobj)' dispatches to 
clone.default instead of clone.ff !? Why?

What is the recommended way to create new S3-methods that get 
dispatched? In earlier versions of the packages I simply exported 
everything - that worked.

You should show us the NAMESPACE entries involving clone and clone.ff 
from ff.

Some comments that may or may not be relevant:

  - Normally you wouldn't export clone.ff, it's enough to register it 
using S3method().

  - You may have created a new generic named clone, and that's what 
clone.ff would attach itself to.  You can have bit::clone and ff::clone 
as different generics and that would cause problems.

I import the generic and use S3method(generic, method).  I don't export 
the methods, so I wouldn't be able to call z <- clone.ff(a).

Thank you Duncan,

bit NAMESPACE has

S3method(clone,default)
export(clone)

ff NAMESPACE has

import(bit)
# wish of CRAN maintainers: export another time here (now maintained and 
exported in bit)
# without this R CMD CHECK complained, but with it R CMD CHECK complains 
also, how to export again and why?
# clone
#,clone.default
 ?clone.ff
,clone.ffdf
S3method("clone",ff)
S3method(clone, ffdf)
# wish of CRAN maintainers: export another time here (now maintained and 
exported in bit)
#S3method(clone, default)

Dario,

there is not such thing as S4 function. However, all functions have an environment and for functions from packages that environment will be the namespace of the package. So in those special cases you can use environmentName() to get the name, e.g.:

> who = function(f) cat(deparse(substitute(f)), "from", environmentName(environment(f)),"\n")
> who(ls)
ls from base 
> who(rnorm)
rnorm from stats 
> who(who)
who from R_GlobalEnv 

However, this won't work for functions defined in arbitrary environments which have no name:

> local({ f= function(x) x
+ who(f)
+ })
f from  

Depending on how much time you want to spend, you can do a search up the frames to find a named environment, but the concept you're trying to implement looks very fragile.

Cheers,
Simon

Pariksheet,

dynamic linking won't work, compile a static version with PIC enabled. If the subproject is autoconf-compatible this means using --disable-shared --with-pic. Then you only need to add libfoo.a to your PKG_LIBS.

Cheers,
Simon

However, it's not available on all platforms and if this dependency is not installed, my autoconf generated configure script defaults to falling back to compiling and installing the dependency from my bundled copy of upstream's pristine source tarball [2].

But it still fails with the above error because the library links against the ".so.1" file and I would need an accompanying symlink.  I tried creating a symlink but can't think of how to get the symlink to the final location.  If my Makefile writes the symlink into ./inst/libs/libghmm.so.1 during compile time it is not actually installed; perhaps because the ./inst/ sub-directories are only copied earlier on when staging and are ignored later?  If I were to create that dangling symlink inside ./inst/libs/ instead of generating it later during compile time, devtools::install() complains about the broken symlink with:

I prefer not to patch upstreams Makefile.am to remove their -version-info, but currently that's the only option I can think of.  I can't find helpful discussion surrounding this in the mailing list archives.

Message-ID: <B273D215-87E2-4570-A501-6CA25740EB24@R-project.org>


Dear Mac useRs.

I'm pleased to announce that thanks to the R Foundation and donations from users like you we are now able to offer a CRAN Mac Builder based on M1 hardware which allows package authors that don't have access to a recent Mac to check their package using the same process as CRAN:

https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html

The machine mirrors all CRAN packages nightly and uses the CRAN building and checking system[1] so the results should be as close to the CRAN setup as feasible.
The resources are limited, so do not treat this as a CI setup, but rather as a service for package authors to facilitate checks before CRAN submissions.

The setup is new and experimental, so please contact me for any comments, problem reports or suggestions regarding the Mac Builder. For any Mac-related questions, please use R-SIG-Mac instead of this mailing list.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Is there a better way ...?
Message-ID: <20211021172850.5ad79de2@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I have a plot method (say plot.foo()) that I want to be able to call so
that if argument "add" is set equal to TRUE, then further structure will
be added to the same plot.  This is to be used *only* in the context in
which the plot being added to was created using plot.foo().

[Please don't ask me why I don't do everything in a single call to
plot.foo().  There *are* reasons.]

In order to make sure that the "further structure" has the appropriate
form, the call to plot.foo(...,add=TRUE,...) needs to access information
about what was done in the previous call to plot.foo().

Initially I tried to effect this by creating, in a call of the form
plot.foo(...,add=FALSE,...), an object, say ".fooInfo", in the global
environment, and then having the call plot.foo(...,add=TRUE,...)
access the necessary information from ".fooInfo".

It all worked OK, but when I built my package for Windoze, using
win-builder, I got a note of the form:

> NOTE
> Found the following assignment to the global environment:
> File 'pckgename/R/plot.foo.R':
>   assign(".fooInfo", fooInfo, pos = 1)

I thought uh-oh; CRAN will kick up a stink if/when I submit my package.

I think I've figured out a work-around using tempfile().  There
are difficulties in that tempfile() creates unique names by tacking
on an alpha-numeric string such as "38348397e595c" to the file name
that I specify, so the call to plot.foo(...,add=TRUE,...) cannot know
the *exact* file name.  I think I can get around that by grepping on
"fooInfo" in list.files(tempdir()).  I also need to make sure that
I unlink() any old instances of files in tempdir() with the string
"fooInfo" in their names before creating a new instance.  Elsewise
ambiguities will ensue.

As I say --- I think this can all be made to work.  But ....
Am I missing some "obvious" strategy?  I.e. is there a
better/simpler/less convoluted way of handling this problem?

Grateful for any pearls of wisdom.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Why not have a private (unexported) environment in your own package
for the same purpose? (That's the strategy used by lattice.) E.g., in
your zzz.R

.FooEnv <- new.env()

and then have your plot.foo write into / read from that. Long term, it
may be better to write accessor functions (which can still be
unexported if only used by your package code) if you want an
implementation-agnostic interface.

I think the simplest answer is to store the variable in the functions
frame. I'm assuming here that the only plot.foo needs access to .fooInfo,
if not this can be changed.


plot.foo <- function (...)
{
    .fooInfo
}
environment(plot.foo) <- new.env()
evalq({
    .fooInfo <- NULL
}, environment(plot.foo))


Make your function, and do whatever you need with .fooInfo within said
function. Whenever you previously updated .fooInfo in the global
environment, update .fooInfo in plot.foo environment instead.
Also, because .fooInfo is not stored in the package's frame, it won't be
locked when the namespace is sealed. If you created it at the toplevel,
that would create some issues. But this works fine.

I agree with the final result, but I'd write the code differently:

plot.foo <- local({

   .fooInfo <- NULL

   function (...) { ... }
})

creates an environment, puts .fooInfo into it with value NULL, then 
creates a function with that environment attached and returns it.

I think Andrew's approach will work, but changing a function's 
environment always worries me.  Using local(), the function assigned to 
plot.foo never has a different environment than the one it ends up with 
(and I don't need to remember how evalq() works).

Thanks everyone for these suggestions.  They seem a great deal
less shaganappi/kludgy than my previous approaches.

I've never really felt totally comfortable with the environment
concept, despite have used it quite a bit (basically in a
hammer-and-hope style.)

Can anyone comment on the difference between Deepayan's suggestion
(create a new environment in the package) and Duncan's suggestion
(create an environment that is local to plot.foo())?  Are there pros
and cons between the two?

And Deepayan:  what is the rationale for not exporting the new
environment that you suggest creating?  Presumably this guards against
something.  What?  I'd just like to extend my (currently minimal)
comprehension of the issues.

I must admit that Andrew's suggestion kind of overwhelms and bewilders
me.  I really have no idea what evalq() does.  I guess I could RTFM,
but the thought of doing that scares me! :-)

Thanks again everybody.

cheers,

Rolf

My suggestion is having a package-specific environment, and Duncan's
is to have a function-specific environment. If you only need this for
this one function, then that should be good enough. If you eventually
want to access the persistent information from multiple functions,
having a package-specific environment would be more useful.

I'm not sure what you are trying to do, but I can't see how you can do
something sensible with a function-specific environment if someone
does

plot.foo(something)
plot.default(1:10)
plot.foo(something else, add = TRUE)

So maybe you would eventually want to set a hook (?setHook) for
plot.new to ensure that no other plot has been created in between,
which could write into this package-specific environment.

Nothing other than the usual reason for not exporting things
unnecessarily, which is to not pollute the user workspace.

Andrew's suggestion looks more complicated than it is. Think of
.fooInfo as a "global" variable, just in your package namespace rather
than .GlobalEnv, so you could do (in your package code)

.fooInfo <- NULL

plot.foo <- function(...)
{
   if (is.null(.fooInfo)) ... # use .fooInfo
   .fooInfo <<- something # set .fooInfo
}

Andrew suggested a separate (and unnamed) environment to store both
.fooInfo and plot.foo, so the setting part becomes a bit more
complicated (but accessing becomes safer in the sense that no other
function can access .fooInfo).

My suggestion is essentially similar, except that you can use <-
instead of <<- because it's an environment.

.fooEnv <- new.env()

plot.foo <- function(...)
{
   if (is.null(.fooEnv$info)) ... # use .fooEnv$info
   .fooEnv$info <- something # set .fooEnv$info
}

I agree with almost everything Deepayan said, but would add one thing:

I agree with that statement, but those aren't the only two choices. 
Your local() call can create several functions and return them in a 
list; then just those functions have access to the local variables.  For 
example,

createFns <- local({

    .fooInfo <- NULL

    fn1 <- function (...) { ... }
    fn2 <- function (...) { ... }

    list(fn1 = fn1, fn2 = fn2)
})

fns <- createFns()
fn1 <- fns$fn1
fn2 <- fns$fn2

Now fn1 and fn2 are functions that can see .fooInfo, and nobody else can 
(without going through contortions).

One other difference between this approach and the package-specific 
environment:  there's only one package-specific environment in 
Deepayan's formulation, but I could call createFns() several times, 
creating several pairs of functions, each pair with its own independent 
version of .fooInfo.

I don't know if that's something that would be useful to you, but 
conceivably you'd want to maintain partial plots in several different 
windows, and that would allow you to do so.

And there are other choices too:  there are several packages 
implementing object systems that allow objects to maintain persistent 
data.   I haven't used those, so this list may contain omissions and 
errors:  R6, R.oo, proto.

Note that the above approach has been how  nls()  has been
implemented for R ... a very long time ago {before R 1.0.0}

e.g. from  example(nls) :

DNase1 <- subset(DNase, Run == 1)
fm1 <- nls(density ~ SSlogis(log(conc), Asym, xmid, scal), DNase1)
str(fm1 $ m)

## so 16 functions, all sharing the *same* environment very
## efficiently and nicely

## this is *the* environment for the fitted model :
fmE <- environment(fm1$m[[1]])
ls.str(fmE)
> convCrit : function ()  
> dev :  num 0.00479
> env : <environment: 0x106c88a0>

> getPars : function ()  
> ....     
> ....     
> ....     

so the environment "contains" the functions themselves (but quite
a few more things) and for an environment that means it only
has pointers to the same function objects which are *also* in  `fm1$m`.

So, there has been a nice convincing and important example on
how to do this - inside R for more than two decennia.

Duncan's version is much clearer than my solution, and the only reason I
use my version is so that the source reference of the function looks
neater, and so that auto-code-indentation won't mess up my source reference
either.
If none of that made sense, don't worry about it, use Duncan's approach.
I think the advantage of Duncan's solution is that getting and setting
.fooInfo is more compact.

It's not clear exactly how you're modifying .fooInfo, but I'll assume
plot.foo is modifying it. Using Duncan's approach, you might do something
like:


plot.foo <- local({


    .fooInfo <- 0


    function (...)
{
    value <- .fooInfo  # get .fooInfo
    .fooInfo <<- .fooInfo + 1  # set .fooInfo, you must use <<- here
instead of <-
    return(value)
}


})


and Deepayan's approach:


..foo.env <- local({


    .fooInfo <- 0


    environment()
})


plot.foo <- function (...)
{
    value <- .foo.env$.fooInfo  # get .fooInfo
    .foo.env$.fooInfo <- .foo.env$.fooInfo + 1  # set .fooInfo
    return(value)
}


Both of these work perfectly fine, so you don't have to worry too much
about which you implement. The differences are mostly just visual
appearance, they have nearly equivalent functionality and performance.

Thanks Duncan,

I finally found the reason for the mysterious dispatch-failure: I had an 
unwanted and unexported replicated definition of the 'clone' generic in 
ff's namespace (a left-over).

I still don't understand how this prevented the proper dispatch since 
the duplicate in ff's namespace it was *not* called. I further 
experimented and *any* non-exported object matching the name of the 
generic caused the problem. Scary, maybe worth a check!

Anyhow, removing the non-exported object solved the problem.

Best regards

Jens

Your NAMESPACE file contains

   S3method("clone",ff)

When R installs your package, it has to figure out where "clone" lives. 
  You imported a copy of it from bit, and then overwrote that imported 
copy with the replicated definition.

That created a new generic belonging to ff, and that's the one that your 
clone.ff method was attached to.

When you called clone(x), you called the bit::clone generic which never 
received the registration, so dispatch to clone.ff never happened.

It makes sense:  you don't want a generic in one package to interfere 
with an unrelated generic in another package that happens to have the 
same name.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] update.formula does not keep.order
Message-ID: <ME3P282MB1283DF427A406FF025AEDFDCA0859@ME3P282MB1283.AUSP282.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi listers,



I have a package asremlPlus on CRAN that manipulates formulae. It uses the keep.order argument, as in the stats::terms function, to allow control over the order of terms in a model.



However, when stats::update.formula is used to update a formula, there is no keep.order argument for update.formula. The result is that the updated formula is always simplified to a sum of single terms and these terms are always re-ordered. I have written a function that is able to update a formula and keep the order. The following example illustrates the problem and my solution.



#Functions to keep.order when a formula is updated

update_keep_order <- function(object, ...) {

  UseMethod("update_keep_order")

}

update_keep_order.formula <- function(old, new, keep.order = TRUE) {

  tmp <- .Call(stats:::C_updateform, as.formula(old), as.formula(new))

  formula(terms.formula(tmp, keep.order = keep.order, simplify = TRUE))

}



#Generate some factors and a formula

facs <- expand.grid(A=1:2, B=1:2, C=1:2, D=1:2)

form <- with(facs, formula(~ A*B + C*D))



#Update with update.formula

(upd <- update(form, ~ . - C, keep.order = TRUE))



#Update with update_keep_order.formula

(upd_keep <- update_keep_order(form, ~ . - C, keep.order = TRUE))



However, the function calls the undocumented function stats::C_updateform and so cannot be added to my package.



Is there another solution to achieve this outcome that does not require this undocumented function and so could be incorporated in an R package on CRAN?



Thanks in advance for any help in solving this issue.



Cheers,



  Chris

I can't think of a short term solution.  The long term solution is to 
prepare and submit a patch to R to add the keep_order argument to 
update.formula.

As a workaround, perhaps you could modify the result of update() to 
restore the original order.  This sounds messy, but if you already have 
code to manipulate formulae, maybe it's mostly in place.  The steps 
would be:

  Decompose the formula into a vector of terms, e.g. ~A + B + A:B + C + 
D + C:D becomes

old <- expression(A, B, A:B, C, D, C:D)

  Update the formula, and decompose the new formula in the same way.

So A + B + D + A:B + C:D becomes

new <- expression(A, B, D, A:B, C:D)


  Match each term in the new vector to its location in the original 
vector, and sort it.

index <- match(new, old)
sorted <- order(index)
new[sorted]

In your example, this gives expression(A, B, A:B, D, C:D) .


  (You'll need to decide what to do with terms that weren't present in 
the original.  They'll have NA values in index.  Presumably they go to 
the end.)

  Rebuild the formula after sorting.

Hi Duncan,

Thanks for your suggestions.

I have now confirmed that bug report 15763 addresses a related problem of the simplify argument. So I could incorporate my modification into that bug report. Or, I could take up your suggested option of dealing with it myself.

New terms are a little tricky. I think that, at least in a fixed model, you would want them to go before any term of which their variables are a subset.

Further investigation is needed.

Cheers,

  Chris

The result is that the updated formula is always simplified to a sum of single terms and these terms are always re-ordered. I have written a function that is able to update a formula and keep the order. The following example illustrates the problem and my solution.

I am getting warnings in some packages about the size of the R folder

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is 20.5Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    data   2.4Mb
    R     17.8Mb

This package contains around 3300 lines of code, if the results of

grep -v '^\s*#' *.R | wc

are correct.

Is this size to be expected? Is there anything I might be missinmg to
make it smaller?

Thanks,

You probably (accidentally?) put some large object into your package,
e.g. a non-function object. But it is hard to say more without seeing
the actual code....

Yes.  To track it down, you need to understand that an INSTALL executes 
everything in the .R files, and saves every object that was created. In 
a simple package, that's just a bunch of functions, but in more 
complicated situations, you may have created some objects in order to 
build functions, even though you don't need them:  but unless you remove 
them, it's very easy to have them included too.

As far as I can see only classes, methods and functions are present
there. I loaded the rdb file and looked at the contents and sizes of
objects.

Am I right in assuming every method or function imported from another
package sits in the database? In another S4 package I see that the
largest objects are nls, cor and lm, which we overload for some S4
classes.

I think imports just get a small record saying where to get the object 
from, they don't get full copies.  That way if you import foo::bar, and 
the foo package gets updated, your package will use the latest version.

If you want to find out what is taking up all the space, this is what 
you can do.  Suppose your package is called "foo".  Then read the index 
to the R objects using

rdx <- readRDS(system.file("R/foo.rdx", package = "foo"))

Then rdx$variables will be a named list.  The names are the names of the 
variables, and the values are offsets and sizes of each variable in the 
foo.rdb file.  So this will print all the sizes from smallest to largest:

sort(sapply(rdx$variables, function(x) x[2]))

If none of those are very big, you could look at

sapply(rdx$references, function(x) x[2]))

for the sizes of the references to other environments.  These are harder 
to interpret, because they get names like "env::3", unlike the 
variables, which have the name they use in R. I suppose you could figure 
out how lazyLoadDBfetch() works and read one of them to see what's in 
it, but I haven't done that.

The byte code attached to each function in a package can be surprisingly
large.  E.g., the byte code for the c. 300 line function Matrix:::replTmat
seems to be c. 4.5 times the size of the raw code:

> object.size(Matrix:::replTmat) /
object.size(as.function(as.list(Matrix:::replTmat)))
5.5 bytes

[Is there a more direct way to remove byte code from a function?  Or to
inspect it?]

Building Matrix with --no-byte-compile reduces the size of R/Matrix.rdx by
more than half, from 2.7 MB to 1 MB.

You can sort of inspect it using compiler::disassemble, though it's not 
very readable.  You can remove it by assigning to the body, e.g.

body(fn) <- body(fn)

Hi,

I wanted to submit a package to CRAN. When I ran R CMD check --as-cran I 
saw that the package name is used by another package. After renaming my 
package I googled the new name and it turned out that an archived 
package has the same name. So I renamed my package the second time.

Question: Could I have used the name of the archived package? Especially 
since we do in both packages something similar?

Hi Sigbert,

the CRAN Repository Policy available at

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

contains

Packages should be named in a way that does not conflict (irrespective of 
case) with any current or past CRAN package (the Archive area can be 
consulted), nor any current Bioconductor package. Package maintainers give 
the right to use that package name to CRAN when they submit, so the CRAN 
team may orphan a package and allow another maintainer to take it over.

HTH,
Bettina

Good day,

How can a parameter take a default value from a vector of permitted ones, if it is missing?

setClassUnion("characterOrMissing", c("character", "missing"))
setClassUnion("integerOrMissing", c("integer", "missing"))
setClass("SetOfParams", representation(A = "characterOrMissing", B = "integer"))
setGeneric("SetOfParams", function(A, B) standardGeneric("SetOfParams"))

setMethod("SetOfParams", c("missing", "missing"), function() # Empty constructor
{
  new("SetOfParams", A = "M", B = 100L)
})

setMethod("SetOfParams", c("characterOrMissing", "integerOrMissing"), function(A = c("L", "M", "N"), B = 100L)
{
  A <- match.arg(A)
  new("SetOfParams", A = A, B = B)
})

SetOfParams(B = 500L)
  Error in match.arg(A) : argument "A" is missing, with no default.

How can I avoid the error about A having no default? I thought I specified it so that it does have one, which match.arg would set for me if the user did not specify one.

>From the line `function(A, B) standardGeneric("SetOfParams")`, A and B will
always have default values of R_MissingArg
Providing default values within the methods does nothing since A and B have
already been initialized before arriving at the method.
You could do something like:


if (missing(A))
    A <- ...
if (missing(B))
    B <- ...


within each method, and that would emulate having default values for A and
B.

You need to define  the generic with a default value for this parameter. Methods can then have a different default value for it. I remember reading this in S4's documentation but don't remember where.

Providing default values within the methods does nothing since A and B have
already been initialized before arriving at the method.
You could do something like:


if (missing(A))
    A <- ...
if (missing(B))
    B <- ...


within each method, and that would emulate having default values for A and
B.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R feature suggestion: Duplicated function arguments
 check
Message-ID: <CALnEB17CMkDvSSBf5WBNnn6wQS9TO6hgJpOVs0jHWd1ysN59_g@mail.gmail.com>

Not sure if this is the best place to post this message, as it is more of a
suggestion than a question.

When an R function accepts more than a handful of arguments there is the
risk that users accidentally provide arguments twice, e.g myfun(A=1, B=2,
C=4, D=5, A=7), and if those two values are not the same it can have
frustrating side-effects. To catch this I am planning to add a check for
duplicated arguments, as shown below, in one of my own functions. I am now
wondering whether this would be a useful feature for R itself to operate in
the background when running any R function that has more than a certain
number of input arguments.

Cheers, Vincent

myfun = function(...) {
  #check input arguments for duplicate assignments
  input = list(...)
  if (length(input) > 0) {
    argNames = names(input)
    dupArgNames = duplicated(argNames)
    if (any(dupArgNames)) {
      for (dupi in unique(argNames[dupArgNames])) {
        dupArgValues = input[which(argNames %in% dupi)]
        if (all(dupArgValues == dupArgValues[[1]])) { # double arguments,
but no confusion about what value should be
          warning(paste0("\nArgument ", dupi, " has been provided more than
once in the same call, which is ambiguous. Please fix."))
        } else { # double arguments, and confusion about what value should
be,
          stop(paste0("\nArgument ", dupi, " has been provided more than
once in the same call, which is ambiguous. Please fix."))
        }
      }
    }
  }
  # rest of code...
}

interesting ... and would make quite some sense.

Can others confirm / disprove ?

Even as co-author of the "using S4 almost everywhere" package 'Matrix'
I wouldn't have known this.

If this is seen to be true (I don't have time for checking just now),
I think it's something we really *should* add to one or more of
the related help pages.

Could you give an example where this is needed?  If a named argument is 
duplicated, R will catch that and give an error message:

   > f(a=1, b=2, a=3)
   Error in f(a = 1, b = 2, a = 3) :
     formal argument "a" matched by multiple actual arguments

So this can only happen when it is an argument in the ... list that is 
duplicated.  But usually those are passed to some other function, so 
something like

   g <- function(...) f(...)

would also catch the duplication in g(a=1, b=2, a=3):

   > g(a=1, b=2, a=3)
   Error in f(...) :
     formal argument "a" matched by multiple actual arguments

The only case where I can see this getting by is where you are never 
using those arguments to match any formal argument, e.g.

   list(a=1, b=2, a=3)

Maybe this should have been made illegal when R was created, but I think 
it's too late to outlaw now:  I'm sure there are lots of people making 
use of this.

Or am I missing something?

It turns out that it is not difficult to find, the excerpt below is from help(setMethod). Maybe  mentioning this in help(setGeneric) would be helpful, as well.

Georgi Boshnakov


=======
Method definitions can have default expressions for arguments, but
     only if the generic function must have _some_ default expression
     for the same argument. (This restriction is imposed by the way R
     manages formal arguments.)  If so, and if the corresponding
     argument is missing in the call to the generic function, the
     default expression in the method is used.  If the method
     definition has no default for the argument, then the expression
     supplied in the definition of the generic function itself is used,
     but note that this expression will be evaluated using the
     enclosing environment of the method, not of the generic function.
     Method selection does not evaluate default expressions.  All
     actual (non-missing) arguments in the signature of the generic
     function will be evaluated when a method is selected-when the call
     to 'standardGeneric(f)' occurs.  Note that specifying class
     '"missing"' in the signature does not require any default
     expressions.

Duncan,

This may not be the place to discuss this so I will be brief.

The question is whether it should be some kind of error to call a function
with two named arguments that are the same.

I can think of a perhaps valid use when a function expects to take the first
few arguments for personal use and then uses ... to pass the rest along to
other functions it calls.

so in your case, slightly extended:

	f(a=1, b=2, a=3, c=-5)

The function might pass along to another function:
	other(arg, ...)
which would be seen as:
	other(arg, a=3, c=-5)

There can of course be other ways to get this result but probably not as
simple. And note this can go several layers deep as various functions call
each other and each has a different need and even meaning for a=something.

Avi

Could you give an example where this is needed?  If a named argument is
duplicated, R will catch that and give an error message:

   > f(a=1, b=2, a=3)
   Error in f(a = 1, b = 2, a = 3) :
     formal argument "a" matched by multiple actual arguments

So this can only happen when it is an argument in the ... list that is
duplicated.  But usually those are passed to some other function, so
something like

   g <- function(...) f(...)

would also catch the duplication in g(a=1, b=2, a=3):

   > g(a=1, b=2, a=3)
   Error in f(...) :
     formal argument "a" matched by multiple actual arguments

The only case where I can see this getting by is where you are never using
those arguments to match any formal argument, e.g.

   list(a=1, b=2, a=3)

Maybe this should have been made illegal when R was created, but I think
it's too late to outlaw now:  I'm sure there are lots of people making use
of this.

Or am I missing something?

Thanks Duncan, I have tried to make a minimalistic example:

myfun = function(...) {
  input = list(...)
  mysum = function(A = c(), B= c()) {
    return(A+B)
  }
  if ("A" %in% names(input) & "B" %in% names(input)) {
    print(mysum(A = input$A, B = input$B))
  }
}

# test:
> myfun(A = 1, B = 2, B = 4)
[1] 3

# So, the second B is ignored.

Vincent,

But is the second being ignored the right result?

In many programming situations, subsequent assignments replace earlier ones.
And consider the way R allows something like this:

func(a=2, b=3, a=4, c=a*b)

Is it clear how to initialize the default for c as it depends on one value
of "a" or the other?

Of course, you could just make multiple settings an error rather than
choosing an arbitrary fix.

R lists are more like a BAG data structure than a SET.

That c=a*b only works with non-standard tidyverse evaluation.  It causes 
other problems, e.g. the inability to pass ... properly (see 
https://github.com/tidyverse/glue/issues/231 for an example).

I think this is similar in nature (though not detail) to an issue raised
on StackOverflow where the OP used "x" in dot args and it clashed with the
"x" in a numDeriv call in my optimx package. I've got a very early fix (I
think), though moderators on StackOverflow were unpleasant enough to
delete my request for the OP to contact me so I could get more
information to make improvements. Sigh. Developers need conversations
with users to improve their code.

Re: argument duplication -- In my view, the first goal should be to inform
the user of the clash. Doing anything further without providing information
is likely a very bad idea, though discussion of possibilities of action after
notification is certainly worthwhile.

Best, JN

Is there any way at all to update the email address of the maintainer of 
a package? (The address of the maintainer of CVXR which is in need of an 
update for the new SCS solver has changed from? @stanford.edu to 
@alumni.stanford.edu, with no access to the former.)

Message-ID: <d8c713ace5336fe1e8bd2dcba8ba76fce56d31e5.camel@exasol.com>

Hello,

I am trying to submit a new package to CRAN. I have fixed all warnings
and errors, and have 1 Note remaining, which I can't get rid off.
Here is the result:

Here my questions:
1. Is my understanding correct that I can ignore the "misspelled words"
in DESCRIPTION?
2. Regarding the note: "Found non-API calls to R:". Our package uses
the internal R connection API to exchange data between the EXASOL
database and R clients. I saw that other packages do that, too; for
example curl:
https://github.com/jeroen/curl/blob/395fbcbc13ef7f38167d3837f50c3cad51902068/src/curl.c
Is there a way to get a waiver for that Note, or is this an impediment
for a CRAN submission? But if latter, why was it allowed to curl?
Is there any way to proceed, any alternative public API which does the
same maybe? (For the sake of completeness here is the source code which
uses the R connection API:
https://github.com/exasol/r-exasol/blob/main/src/r_exasol/rconnection/r_reader_connection.cpp
https://github.com/exasol/r-exasol/blob/main/src/r_exasol/rconnection/r_writer_connection.cpp
)

I really appreciate any help on this topic!!!

Thanks in advance,
Thomas

Thanks for your replies, I only just noticed them as I had daily-digest =
true and someone seems to have removed my e-mail address when replying to
the list. Never mind, I have now switched my daily-digest to false.

Yes - The issue is that "myfun(A = 1, B = 2, B = 4)" in the example below
is ambiguous and only the end-user knows whether B should be 2 or 4.
Either way, I will just implement my own solution. Just wanted to report
that I ran into this situation and maybe others too.

Best, Vincent

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Inconsistent available package dependencies
Message-ID: <CAEYsH0YU3jUgdc6MMwbvBz3--Fsin4F=0WhFGuG8B0WkcEZGrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I maintain a package (netgsa) that has been on CRAN since september 2021
and recently got an email about CRAN check failures. There are 2 errors and
1 warning. The failures are listed here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_netgsa.html.

The failures are a result of Bioconductor packages. Both errors are about
package dependencies not being available (org.Hs.eg.db and/or ndexr) while
the warning comes from the vignette building failing which is caused by an
error in the graphite package. I checked and these packages were and still
are available on Bioconductor. The errors occurred on macOS 10.13.6. While
not exactly the same OS, I ran R CMD check --as-cran on my macOS 10.15.7
and did not get any errors or warnings. It seems odd that I would get a
package dependency availability error for only 2 flavors and that I would
not be able to reproduce this on a similar OS.

I searched online but have not found anything useful. I built the package
under R 4.0.2 which is now a little dated so am wondering if it is related
to this? Do I need to rebuild using the most recent version of R? Any
advice on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated!

Best,

Mike

You should ALWAYS build with the latest stable AND the latest development versions of R before submitting.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Checking package in Windows fails
Message-ID: <c0e3ee56-9aeb-c98c-371c-fdbc33785d24@Be-Logical.nl>

Hi,

I have written a function which
- checks if the input is a raw-vector
- if the input is a file-descriptor, it converts the file-content to a 
raw-vector
- if the input is a URL, it converts the content to a raw vector
- if the input is a character-string, it is converted to a raw vector.

The URL-test relys on package pingr (line 17 in 'input_to_raw.R'). 
'is_online() tests if there is an internet-connection.
Line 18 tests if the URL is a valid URL. This test relys on the code in 
'Rex.R'. (I don't know why I have to explicitly include 'library("rex")' 
in the code since I have added rex to the Imports in the DESCRIPTION)

After incorporating this code in my package, the package passes all 
tests both under Linux as on Windows(10).

devtools::check_win_devel however returns with this error:

Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = h) :
   response reading failed

How can I solve this problem?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using \donttest with R >= 4.0.0
Message-ID: <CABW7ZOQjUBfe09yyx0rdp5b7fyGQ67bxUfz2cfVeq7Ut8-GOEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a package maintainer for the package "fabisearch" which is now
archived on CRAN. The package includes many examples which take a long time
to run. In past versions of R, I used to simply wrap these in \donttest and
the examples ran as expected. With R >= 4.0.0 however, examples wrapped in
\donttest are run during R CMD check --as-cran. This causes issues with my
package as it takes way too long to run the entire check for CRAN
submission.

I have looked across stackoverflow and other forums to see what are some
possible solutions to implement. From the few that I was able to find,
there were none that work. The most promising seemed to be to simply use
\dontrun instead of \donttest, but this caused my package to be flagged
during submission and failed the initial check.

As such, I am looking for help with this matter. Now that the functionality
of \donttest has changed, what is the appropriate/best way for me to keep
my current examples while ensuring that during the R CMD check --as-cran
process these examples are not run?

Cheers,

Martin

I'd say if you want to keep those examples, then wrap them in \dontrun, 
and add other examples that execute quickly.

Even better might be to include only the ones that execute quickly: 
just like CRAN, users don't want to wait a long time for examples to 
finish.

Hi Duncan,

That's a fair point, and I think making the examples run quicker probably
makes the most sense. I have bad experiences with using dontrun - my
package always gets flagged. Although not ideal, it's probably better to
include some very fast running examples rather than none at all. Appreciate
your advice/help!

Cheers,

Martin

I have been using dontrun for a long time (and I am still using it) 
without any real issues. Initially, I used it to get rid of runtime 
notes impeding submission to CRAN. Now I am also using it for additional 
features, e.g., to describe some additional analyses / figure layouts.

I always check my packages under R-devel on 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/ before submission to CRAN. If this 
does not trigger any notes, the package is good to go.

Best, Guido

Hi Guido,

Yes \dontrun works fine for me as well when I'm running the package check
on my own, as well as the win-builder link you've sent. The problem I
always run into is that when it first gets inspected by CRAN it is always
flagged and I am asked to change \dontrun to \donttest, or remove \dontrun
completely. I'm not sure if there is a way for me to avoid that.

Best,

Martin

   (This crossed with Martin Ondrus's reply).

   In the past few years CRAN screeners have gotten more strict about 
\dontrun{}; a first-round screening often comes back requesting that 
\dontrun{}, and commented-out examples, not be used.

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2018q3/003084.html
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2018q2/002811.html

   Guido, perhaps the screening is being applied differently in your case?

   Another strategy, albeit one that is a little bit annoying/requires 
some more machinery, is to store pre-computed objects in 
inst/example-data, then do something like


fitted_model <- readRDS(system.file("example-data", "fit1.rds", package 
= "my_pkg"))

  the object (which takes too long to fit as part of a testing flow) 
then becomes available for showing how methods apply to it.

   cheers
    Ben

Have you added the corresponding importFrom(...) [1] commands to your
NAMESPACE file?

Theoretically, this invites a class of errors known as "time-of-check
to time-of-use" [2]: the user may go offline after the
pingr::is_online() check but before the httr::GET() request uses the
remote resource. But that's not what's causing you problems.

The problem here is that pingr's definition of "is online" differs from
"is able to fetch the URL you're testing", and I'm afraid it's
impossible to solve in the general sense. What you could do instead is
use tryCatch() to handle the error originating from curl and return
something else instead.

Or maybe letting the error propagate is the right idea. It may be bad
for reproducibility when a function silently returns something
completely different after the user goes offline. Then you would have
to handle the error in your tests instead of the function. A simple
option is wrapping the whole block of test code in try(), but that would
handle all errors, including real bugs.

A more complicated solution would be to handle the connection errors
specifically, construct error objects of class "connection_error",
signal them from the function and only handle those when testing via
tryCatch(..., connection_error = ...). This would let you both (1)
correctly propagate connection errors to the user instead of silently
returning the URL itself and (2) not crash the tests despite that.
See ?conditions for more information on that topic.

Thanks for your reply.

I have moved new/edited 'input_to_raw' code and the validation code to 
another file with all kind of utility-functions and that seems to have 
solved that problem. (But I don't understand why that helped ;-()

Hopefully then next version of my client will be using C++ to speed up 
reading from the socketConnection. And in that version I'll try to use 
tour suggestions. Since I am new to C++ that will take some time.

I don't edit the NAMESPACE file by hand. It is created by roxygen2.

Right. In that case, use an @importFrom tag:

Good day,

I read in the documentation of SetMethod that "Roughly, if the generic has ... as one of its arguments, then the method may have extra formal arguments, which will be matched from the arguments matching ... in the call to f." I was hoping that ellipsis could be also part of a method because this explanation doesn't explicitly rule it out. What I am hoping to do is:

setGeneric("Example", function(x, ...) standardGeneric("Example"))
setMethod("Example", "numeric", function(x, y, ...) as.list(...))
Example(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3, a = 99) # Error in typeof(x) : argument "x" is missing, with no default

So, ellipsis can't be a formal of a method, but only in the generic? May this be clarified by the documentation?

Michael,

this is really a CRAN question rather than a package question so you may have more luck asking CRAN, but generally it is not a a good idea to have strong dependencies (Depends/Imports) on Bioconductor packages. If you want to use non-CRAN packages I would recommend weak depends like Suggests since your package won't work otherwise. For example, Bioconductor does not provide any binaries for the big-sur CRAN release of R, so your package cannot be installed by users if it depends on any BioC packages with native code. In fact, the check report you linked already warns you about your dependencies in general:

Version: 4.0.2
Check: package dependencies
Result: NOTE
    Imports includes 22 non-default packages.
    Importing from so many packages makes the package vulnerable to any of
    them becoming unavailable. Move as many as possible to Suggests and
    use conditionally.

FWIW the reason you got the notification later is that macOS checks are not done immediately on submission otherwise the package would not have been accepted in the first place. That said, if you have issues with dependencies on the macOS build machines just contact me and I can install them if they are available (I have now kick-started a script that attempts to automatically detect and install missing dependencies if available so you may see it in the next check run), but as discussed above you should still re-think your dependencies.

Cheers,
Simon

It seems that some of your dependencies which use compiled code
manage to crash the R process on CRAN Mac machines. Since testthat
normally hides most output from you and it doesn't get a chance to
produce useful output on R process crash, it's hard to determine where
the crash occurs, especially with testthat's backtrace being so long.

Try submitting the package to
<https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html>: that should give
you the full backtrace, at least.

If the *.Rout files from the Mac builder don't pinpoint the culprit, try
passing different reporter= arguments to test_check() and see if any of
them result in verbose logs that show every test being run.
Alternatively, switch some of your tests to the classic R tests, which
produce a verbose .Rout file for every tests/*.R file [*].

Are you sure about this? I don't think testthat hides any output. R
CMD check on the other hand AFAICT only shows the last 13 lines by
default. See the _R_CHECK_TESTS_NLINES_ environment variable in
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html

This is an arm64 mac, and the package does not fail on that:
https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_BCEA.html

It is still worth a shot, the crash might be non-deterministic. If it
does not fail, then you can try rhub::check() and select an x86_64
macOS builder.
You can supply environment variables to set in rhub::check, so you can
set _R_CHECK_TESTS_NLINES_ to zero, or you'll also have access to the
testthat.Rout* files at the end of the check.

Considering that your package does not have any compiled code, the
crash is probably in some other package, which will make this quite
hard to fix, especially if you cannot reproduce the crash on R-hub.
FWIW I just ran it on my x86_64 mac and it did not crash.

I don't think that a different reporter will help if you only have the
truncated R CMD check output.

Indeed you're right, R CMD check truncating the output is the main
problem here. With a full traceback, it would at least be possible to
see which dependency crashes R on CRAN Macs. I should have been more
clear in my e-mail.

By "testthat hiding output" I mean that there's no *.Rout[.fail] files
for every file in tests/testthat/*.R with line-by-line output of the
test code. In cases when R itself crashes in the middle of the test run,
these *.Rout.fail files could be useful to find out which line caused
the crash. With testthat, crashing the R process during tests results
in a single testthat.Rout.fail:

Here, the traceback makes the answer obvious, but it's not always so.
With serious heap corruption, it's possible to get just:

> > test_check("package_name")
> free(): invalid pointer
> Aborted

With no indication of the call or the file causing the crash.

You are right that this is not the main problem here: if the test
output wasn't truncated by R CMD check, we would know the origin of the
crash, even without testthat.

Nathan,

testthat is notorious for obfuscation and unhelpful output as can be clearly seen in the head of testthat.Rout.fail:

> library(testthat)
> library(BCEA)

Attaching package: 'BCEA'

The following object is masked from 'package:graphics':

    contour

> 
> test_check("BCEA")

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x10d492ffc, cause 'memory not mapped'

However this appears to be hard to debug, because it is a fall out from some memory corruption and/or allocator mistmatch: the crash happens in free() while doing GC (see below). Since it happens in the GC, many bad things happen afterwards.
With some lldb magic I could trace that the crash happens during
 ..getNamespace(c("Matrix", "1.3-3"), "stanfit")
 load(test_path("data", "stanfit.RData"))
but as I said that's likely too late - the memory corruption/issue likely happened before. Since BCEA itself doesn't have native code, this is likely a bug in some of the packages it depends on, but quite a serious one since it affects subsequent code in R.

The list of packages loaded at the time of the crash - so one of them is the culprit:

 [1] "rstan"          "tidyselect"     "purrr"          "reshape2"      
 [5] "lattice"        "V8"             "colorspace"     "vctrs"         
 [9] "generics"       "testthat"       "stats4"         "BCEA"          
[13] "loo"            "grDevices"      "R2jags"         "utf8"          
[17] "rlang"          "pkgbuild"       "pillar"         "glue"          
[21] "withr"          "DBI"            "matrixStats"    "lifecycle"     
[25] "plyr"           "stringr"        "munsell"        "gtable"        
[29] "coda"           "codetools"      "inline"         "callr"         
[33] "ps"             "parallel"       "curl"           "fansi"         
[37] "methods"        "Rcpp"           "scales"         "desc"          
[41] "RcppParallel"   "StanHeaders"    "GrassmannOptim" "jsonlite"      
[45] "abind"          "gridExtra"      "winch"          "rjags"         
[49] "ggplot2"        "stats"          "datasets"       "graphics"      
[53] "stringi"        "processx"       "dplyr"          "grid"          
[57] "rprojroot"      "cli"            "tools"          "magrittr"      
[61] "tibble"         "crayon"         "pkgconfig"      "Matrix"        
[65] "MASS"           "ellipsis"       "utils"          "prettyunits"   
[69] "assertthat"     "base"           "boot"           "R6"            
[73] "R2WinBUGS"      "compiler"      

My guess would be that the issue could be in RcppParallel which overrides the memory allocator:

* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x11649fffc)
  * frame #0: 0x00000001097c517f libtbbmalloc.dylib`__TBB_malloc_safer_msize + 63
    frame #1: 0x00007fff76f746fd libsystem_malloc.dylib`free + 96
    frame #2: 0x00000001001c9227 libR.dylib`RunGenCollect at memory.c:1114 [opt]
    frame #3: 0x00000001001c9038 libR.dylib`RunGenCollect(size_needed=0) at memory.c:1896 [opt]
    frame #4: 0x00000001001bf769 libR.dylib`R_gc_internal(size_needed=0) at memory.c:3129 [opt]

(lldb) image lookup -va 0x00000001097c517f
      Address: libtbbmalloc.dylib[0x000000000001117f] (libtbbmalloc.dylib.__TEXT.__text + 65375)
      Summary: libtbbmalloc.dylib`__TBB_malloc_safer_msize + 63
       Module: file = "/Volumes/Builds/packages/high-sierra-x86_64/Rlib/4.1/RcppParallel/lib/libtbbmalloc.dylib", arch = "x86_64"
       Symbol: id = {0x0000060c}, range = [0x00000001097c5140-0x00000001097c5290), mangled="__TBB_malloc_safer_msize"

but that's just a wild guess... (CCing Kevin just in case he can shed a light on whether TBB allocator should be involved in regular R garbage collection).

Cheers,
Simon

That shouldn't be happening, at least not by default. However, RcppParallel
does ship with tbbmalloc_proxy, which is a library that, when loaded, will
overload the default allocators to use TBB's allocators instead. The
intention is normally that these libraries would be loaded via e.g.
LD_PRELOAD or something similar, since changing the allocator at runtime
would cause these sorts of issues.

If I test with the following:

trace(dyn.load, quote({
  if (grepl("tbbmalloc_proxy", x))
    print(rlang::trace_back())
}), print = FALSE)

devtools::test()

then I see:

  1. ??base::load(test_path("data", "stanfit.RData")) at test-bcea.R:179:2
  2. ??base::..getNamespace(`<chr>`, "stanfit")
  3.   ??base::tryCatch(...)
  4.   ? ??base tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
  5.   ?   ??base tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
  6.   ?     ??base doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
  7.   ??base::loadNamespace(name)
  8.     ??base runHook(".onLoad", env, package.lib, package)
  9.       ??base::tryCatch(fun(libname, pkgname), error = identity)
 10.       ? ??base tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
 11.       ?   ??base tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
 12.       ?     ??base doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
 13.       ??rstan fun(libname, pkgname)
 14.         ??base::dyn.load(tbbmalloc_proxy, local = FALSE, now = TRUE)

My guess is that the 'rstan' package is trying to forcefully load
libtbbmalloc_proxy.dylib at runtime, and that's causing the issue. IMHO
'rstan' shouldn't be doing that, at least definitely not by default.

Best,
Kevin

Kevin,

thanks, that's very helpful! So this is a serious bug in rstan - apparently they only do that on macOS which explains why other platforms don't see it:

.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
[...]
  ## the tbbmalloc_proxy is not loaded by RcppParallel which is linked
  ## in by default on macOS; unloading only works under R >= 4.0 so that
  ## this is only done for R >= 4.0
  if(R.version$major >= 4 && Sys.info()["sysname"] == "Darwin") {
      tbbmalloc_proxy  <- system.file("lib/libtbbmalloc_proxy.dylib", package="RcppParallel", mustWork=FALSE)
      tbbmalloc_proxyDllInfo <<- dyn.load(tbbmalloc_proxy, local = FALSE, now = TRUE)
  }

I can confirm that commenting out that part solves the segfault and BCEA passes the tests.

@Ben, please fix and submit a new version of rstan (see discussion below).

Thanks,
Simon

However, RcppParallel does ship with tbbmalloc_proxy, which is a library that, when loaded, will overload the default allocators to use TBB's allocators instead. The intention is normally that these libraries would be loaded via e.g. LD_PRELOAD or something similar, since changing the allocator at runtime would cause these sorts of issues.

Thanks everyone for your help with this.TBH the technical nature is more than a little above my head.What are you advising as the current solution to enable me to resubmit the package to CRAN?BCEA doesn't have a strong dependency on rstan so I could remove it as a simple solution?Thanks again for all the help!

? ## the tbbmalloc_proxy is not loaded by RcppParallel which is linked

? }

I can confirm that commenting out that part solves the segfault and BCEA passes the tests.

@Ben, please fix and submit a new version of rstan (see discussion below).

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Best way to cache a dataframe available for all
 functions in a package
Message-ID: <CABRi=u3Lk+LJF44K3oXstjF9pfhHZWojdrXGu4gNt+yRhMRf+A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am writing a package that needs to load some data from a URL and have
such data (meta data) available when using other functions in the package,
and I would like some advice on how to properly manage such situation.


My first guess would be to create a function to downloads that meta data,
and make this function run when loading the package. I am even familiar
with this, and I could manage.

But the second part, making this sort of data frame available for other
functions in the package, how can I achieve it? Of course I can call the
function that downloads and prepares the data at every use of the other
functions, but that would mean connecting to the Internet again and again.
So, in other words, is there a way to "cache" into memory a data frame
(without having to create an object)?

How could I achieve such thing? What are the kind of keywords that I need
to use when looking for help?

Thank you very much,

Xavier

Hello,

The trick is to store cached objects in an environment. In our team
some of us have started calling this environment "the" to reflect that
the elements in that environment are global singletons.

Create the environment somewhere in your package:

```
the <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
```

Then you can initialise and/or retrieve like this:

```
my_data <- function() {
  if (is.null(the$data)) {
    the$data <- generate_data()
  }
  the$data
}
```

This is much better than initialising on load. Downloading on load
would slow down loading your package and any packages that depend on
it. Also the download might fail, causing the loading of your package
to fail in turn.

Best,
Lionel

Agreed. One can also initialise such an environment as a package option in
.onLoad which may be better or worse depending in part on how much
restriction you want to place on the environment

Agreed. I have used `.pkgenv` in a few packages (digest, rpushbullet, ...),
and usually added a comment that it is package-global.

And so have a few others:

Nathan,

no action is needed on your end since it's not your fault. It was good of you to have the test there because it unearthed the issue. I have re-run the test with hot-fixed rstan and it passes the check so you're good as far as I'm concerned. As you say, since it's not a strong dependency users can use your package even if rstan is broken. More urgently we need an update from rstan and stanette (.onUnoad needs corresponding fix in both cases as well).

Cheers,
Simon

However, RcppParallel does ship with tbbmalloc_proxy, which is a library that, when loaded, will overload the default allocators to use TBB's allocators instead. The intention is normally that these libraries would be loaded via e.g. LD_PRELOAD or something similar, since changing the allocator at runtime would cause these sorts of issues.

Dear Lionel, Hugh and Dirk,

Many, many thanks for your input. I will definitively study the different
proposals and will check on the different implementations and ideas to
evaluate what is the most convenient. And will do a crash course on
environments and learn something new.

At first sight the bit at the "spData" package seems quite appropriate for
me. I may take the liberty to ask again if I got stuck.

Best regards and, again, thank you.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] socketConnection, delay when reading from
Message-ID: <53befd0f-c41d-ce6d-6ca0-e25280468d40@Be-Logical.nl>


Hi,

I have been working on a R-client for the BaseX XML-database and version 
0.9.2 is nearly finished (submitting version 0.9.0 was rejected by CRAN).
Version 0.3 of RBaseX can be found here 
(https://cran.microsoft.com/web/packages/RBaseX/index.html).

The client-server protocol specifies that the communication between the 
client and the database is based on a socket. The code (below) shows how 
I create that socket.

Writing to the socket works perfect. Reading from the sockets (see 
second codeblock) also produces correct results. The problem however is 
that the timeout, as specified when initializing the socket, causes a 1 
second delay for every read-operation.
I have experimented a lot with different settings and have been 
searching a lot on internet, but I can't find any method to get rid of 
that delay. (In C or C++ that should be easier but I have never before 
had any need to use those languages).
The very first version of my client used a block-size of 1 when reading. 
That gave acceptable response times for small query-results but reading 
large responses from the database took very long time.

Do you have any suggestions on how to cope with this problem?

Ben Engbers

           open = "w+b", server = FALSE, blocking = TRUE, encoding = 
"UTF-8", timeout = 1)
         }, error = function(e) {
           stop("Cannot open the connection")

You are attempting to read 1024 bytes.  If the socket returns fewer, the 
code presumably assumes it should wait for more.  You should specify the 
number to read to be no larger than you'll receive.  That's why reading 
a byte at a time works well for small reads.

To handle larger ones, you need to know what size blocks you are going 
to receive with each read.  If that varies unpredictably, I doubt if 
there's much you can do other than reducing the timeout.

That's what I figured out also?. The problem is that even when I reduce the size to 2 bytes and there is only 1byte available in the socket, the code will wait for 1 second which is the minimum time-out?.BenVerzonden vanaf mijn Galaxy

Does the message start with a length or a command whose argument length is known
depending on the particular command?
If so first read the length or command and from that the length of the
remainder of
the message can be determined.

No, according to the specification the minimal number of bytes that is 
returned is 2. There is no maximum. (When querying a database you never 
know on forehand how many records match the query so by definition you 
can't calculate the size of the message).

In some C, C++ or Java-code I found on internet, it was possible to 
change the timeout settings so that there would be no delay. Of course 
this would have as consequence that in your code you have to deal with 
the possibility that the message has not been completely returned.

In R you can set the timeout to 0 but that results in errors (at least 
on Windows)

Whether the length is variable or not isn't relevant. The point is
whether the message is prefaced by a length or command from which the
length can be derived.  Maybe it is not and you will have to rely on
inefficient methods but in many cases protocols are designed to avoid
such problems.

This is a null-terminated message protocol [1]. It has to be processed one byte at a time.

The message may contain embedded 0x00's. To distinguish these embedded 
0x00's (and 0xFF's) from a terminating 0x00, embedded 0x00's and 0xFFare 
prefixed with a 0xFF byte. This means that when you process one byte at 
a time you have to perform a check on every byte. This results in 
totally unacceptable response times (My first version of this client was 
based on this approach)

The only alternative solution I can think off is to use C++ to create a 
socket and a function that reads from the socket. But since I have 
hardly any experience with C++ programming nor using the rcpp package....

Maybe time to learn it. At least to assemble complete messages.

That said, the design of this protocol is intrinsically inefficient. Maybe they will upgrade if the software gets popular.

I think you could use non-blocking read. Read what is available in 
chunks (e.g. up to 1024 bytes long). And based on what is read already, 
figure out whether it is all data or not. Something along the lines as 
the demo below. The demo, though, is polling too much (re-running 
readBin to only find out no data is available yet). It should be 
possible to improve with socketSelect().

Tomas

# the client

con2 <- socketConnection("localhost", port = 6011, open = "rb")
cat("Connected...\n")
total <- 0

done <- function(n) {
 ? n >= 1e8
}

while(!done(total)) {
 ?? r <- readBin(con2, "raw", 1024)
 ?? total <- total + length(r)
 ?? cat("Read", length(r), "bytes (total ", total, ").\n")
}
close(con2)

# the server

n <- 1e8
w <- as.raw(runif(n, 0, 255))
con1 <- socketConnection(port = 6011, blocking = TRUE, server = TRUE, 
open="a+b")
cat("Connected...\n")
writeBin(w, con1)
cat("Data sent to client...\n")
close(con1)

This is an extended demo with socketSelect() used to wait on the client 
for some data to be available, to avoid consuming too much CPU by 
polling. To be pasted into two R sessions running on the same computer.
You would have to replace the function done() with something figuring 
out from the data whether it is complete or not, based on the protocol.

I'll first finish the current development but then I will see if your 
suggestion is usefull.

Perhaps people who teach these things could give best recommendations 
(and those may not be reading this list).

It would be useful to learn the basics of sockets. The wikipedia might 
work if you wanted something short: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets.

And then you could read the online R help for the R-level socket 
functions used in the demo program. For the parallel package (e.g. PSOCK 
clusters), you might also read the vignette of that package. And to look 
for usage patterns of the R socket API, one could look into the sources 
of the parallel package (the part implemented in R).

Good day,

What I am misunderstanding about the inherits = TRUE option of mget? I expect the small example to work.

f <- function(x, .iteration = i) g() 
g <- function() mget(".iteration", inherits = TRUE)
f(10, 1)
Error: value for ?.iteration? not found

That has nothing to do with inherits and is expected - it's identical to

> f <- function(x, .iteration = i) g() 
> g <- function() .iteration
> f(10, 1)
Error in g() : object '.iteration' not found

Please note that R is lexically scoped and you defined g in the global environment so it has no way of seeing inside f. This would work:

> f <- function(x, .iteration = i) {
+   g <- function() .iteration
+   g() 
+ }
> f(10, 1)
[1] 1

since then the environment of f is the parent env of g.

If you want dynamic scoping (not what R uses!) you can use dynGet():

> f <- function(x, .iteration = i) g() 
> g <- function() dynGet(".iteration")
> f(10,1)
[1] 1

but since that is non-standard the docs warn:

     ?dynGet()? is somewhat experimental and to be used _inside_
     another function.  It looks for an object in the callers, i.e.,
     the ?sys.frame()?s of the function.  Use with caution.

Cheers,
Simon

I had the same problem recently when developing a package and have some code here that might help you understand scoping a bit more.
It highlights the subtle difference between parent frame and environment.
I don't want to spam this list, so feel free to ignore ;)

Berry


a <- function(x) {aa <- "stuff"; b(x)}
b <- function(y) {
   print(ls(parent.frame()))            # parent.frame: aa, x      env in which the function was called  - dynamic scoping
   print(ls(parent.env(environment())) )# parent.env: a, b   enclosing env in which function was defined - lexical scoping
   message(aa) # # error: 'aa' not found         -      dynGet("aa") would work
}
a(7)
a <- function(x) {aa <- "stuff"; b(x)}
b <- function(y) {env <- parent.frame(); eval(substitute(aa), env)}
a(7)
b <- function(y) {eval.parent(substitute(aa))}
a(7)
b <- function(y) {eval.parent(aa)}
a(7) # aa not found: when passed to eval.parent, it is evaluated first (unless substituted)

     the ?sys.frame()?s of the function.  Use with caution.

Cheers,
Simon

Good day,

I wonder why the runnable example below takes a long time to finish.

library(SummarizedExperiment) # Or BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment") to install it beforehand.

setClassUnion("characterOrMissing", c("character", "missing"))
setClassUnion("integerOrMissing", c("integer", "missing"))
setClass("ParamsSet", representation(A = "characterOrMissing", B = "integer"))
setGeneric("ParamsSet", function(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) standardGeneric("ParamsSet"))

setMethod("ParamsSet", c("missing", "missing", "missing", "missing", "missing", "missing", "missing", "missing"),
function() # Empty constructor
{
  new("ParamsSet", A = 'M', B = 300L)
})

setMethod("ParamsSet", c("characterOrMissing", "integerOrMissing", "integerOrMissing", "integerOrMissing",
                         "characterOrMissing", "integerOrMissing", "integerOrMissing", "integerOrMissing"),
function(A = c('L', 'M', 'N'), B = 500, C = 100, D, E, F, G, H)
{
  if(missing(A)) A <- 'L' # Mimick match.arg.
  if(missing(B)) B <- 500L # Hack to implement parameter defaults not specified by generic.
  if(missing(C)) C <- 100L
  new("ParamsSet", A = A, B = B)
})

system.time(ParamsSet(B = 999L)) # Slow or fast, depending on if SummarizedExperiment loaded.

The CPU and RAM usage increase sharply when the above line is run, dependent on SummarizedExperiment in the background. The delay doesn't happen when run a second time, presumably due to caching.

Hi,

I submitted the most recent version of my package to CRAN and to 
<https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html>
Macbuilder reported no problems.

Best regards,

I see that there doesn't exist a Solaris flavor on any CRAN check page.
However, I'm certain that Solaris was being checked up until very recently.

Is this just temporary?

Is there any information for the future of Solaris on CRAN?

No "official" word yet on this list, r-devel or elsewhere, or via commits to
the CRAN Policy (which a cron job of mine monitors).

But Henrik was eagle-eyed and spotted a number of changes to the svn (or git
mirror thereof) writing Solaris out of the official documentation:

  https://twitter.com/henrikbengtsson/status/1466877096471379970

So yes it seems like an era is coming to a close.

Would this mean we could start using little endian bit strings, as I think
only the Solaris platform was big endian (or was it the other way around)?

It depends on the hardware, not the OS.
CRAN checked on Intel CPUs, which are little endian while formerly 
Solaris was typically used on Sparc which is big endian.

In any case, please try to write cross platform code further on. ARM and 
x86-64 may agree, but we do not know what comes next. And old ideas may 
be revived more quickly than expected:
Not too many people expected 20 years ago that the future of scientific 
computing in 2021 would still/again happen on platforms without support 
for long doubles / extended precision.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

I'd second Uwe's point. I was one of 31 signatories to first IEEE 754 (I didn't participate in
the two more recent releases, as I already tore my hair out with the details of low level
bit manipulations). Before the standard, porting code was truly a nightmare. We did it
because we had to and were too ignorant to realize what a fools task it was. Keep code
portable please.

Hi Tomas,

I have implemented your suggestions as follows: (I'm not certain yet if 
the first check in done - total_length == 0 is realy needed)

Creating the socket:

CreateSocket = function(host, port = 1984L, username, password) {
   tryCatch(
     {conn <- private$conn <- socketConnection(
       host = "localhost", port,
       open = "w+b", server = FALSE, blocking = FALSE, encoding = "UTF-8")
     }, error = function(e) {
       stop("Cannot open the connection")
      }
   )

#### Authenticating

response <- readBin_(conn) %>% rawToChar()
===> # browser()
splitted <-strsplit(response, "\\:")
ifelse(length(splitted[[1]]) > 1,
   { realm <- splitted[[1]][1]
     code  <- paste(username, realm, password, sep=":")
     nonce <- splitted[[1]][2] },
   { code  <- password
     nonce <- splitted[[1]][1]}
   )
code <- md5(paste(md5(code), nonce, sep = "")) %>% charToRaw()
# send username + code
auth <- c(charToRaw(username), as.raw(0x00), code, as.raw(0x00))
writeBin(auth, private$conn)
Accepted <- readBin(conn, what = "raw", n = 1) == 0x00
if (!Accepted) {
close(private$conn)
stop("Access denied")
}


Reading from the socket:

done <- function(rd, total_length) {
   if (total_length == 0) {   to done
     finish <- FALSE
   } else {
     finish <- ifelse(length(rd == Bsize), FALSE, TRUE)
   }
   return(finish)
}

readBin_ <- function(conn) {
   total_read <- rd <- as.raw(c())
   while(!done(rd, length(total_read))) {
     rd <- readBin(conn, "raw", Bsize)
     total_read %<>% c(rd)
     }
   return(total_read)
}

The first time readBin is used is while authenticating a new session.
This code fails ;-(

But when I insert a  call to browser() after the first authentication 
line, I can execute all the following code without problems. This 
results in a fully functional session. And all the other following calls 
to readBin_ return the correct data.
This means that 'done' and 'readBin' do exactly what they are intended 
to do.

Question
Why does creating and authenticating fail when a call to browser() is 
missing? (Or why does authentication succeed after I have debugged

Best,
Ben

After a long nightly session, I ended up with inserting a wait between

The new code, which now uses a non-blocking socket, takes less than 4 
seconds to execute the 53 tests. Compared to the 120 seconds when using 
a blocking socket, this was worth the effort.

Ok, this confirms there is a race condition, but the next step should be 
removing it, so that it works reliably. Actually, one way to test that 
such programs are race-free is to actually on purpose insert sleeps at 
various locations - the programs then should still work.

I am not able to give more specific advice based on the code snippet you 
sent yesterday, but in principle, you can use socketSelect() to wait for 
the connection to become ready to be read from. In either case, there 
needs to be some way to tell whether the received data is complete. 
Either you know the length, or there is some special mark in the data, 
there has to be something.

If you need more help from people on the list, it might be better to 
send a small, but full complete example, so also with a server, so that 
it is something people could run and reproduce.

writeBin(auth, private$conn)
Sys.sleep(.1)
Accepted <- readBin(conn, what = "raw", n = 1) == 0

I checked in the debugger that auth has the correct length. And 
readBin(conn, what = "raw", n = 1) should return exactly 1 byte (either 
0x00 or 0x01.

You say that socketSelect() can be used to wait for the connection to 
become ready.
How? The only option I see is a "no-delay". Should I set this to FALSE? 
I tried adding 'options = getOption(c("no-delay = <value>"))' when 
creating the socketConnection. In the tesfile (see below) value TRUE or 
FALSE were both accepted. In the package, createSocket still failed.

The server can be downloaded from https://basex.org/download/. After 
unzipping it can be started with 'basexserver &'.

I have attached a testfile.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R/CRAN switch to UCRT on Windows
Message-ID: <8462db5c-4711-8569-2db5-bcd79597163f@gmail.com>

(My apologies for cross-posting to those reading also the R-devel 
mailing list)

Please note an update concerning the support of UTF-8 as native encoding 
on Windows, which may at this point be of interest particularly to 
developers of packages with native code and to R users using R-devel 
(the development version of R) on Windows:


https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/12/07/upcoming-changes-in-r-4.2-on-windows/

The key part is that CRAN will switch the incoming checks of R packages 
on Windows to a new toolchain targeting UCRT on Monday, December 13.

It may take up to several days for all systems to synchronize and during 
this time, it may be difficult to build R-devel on Windows from source 
or to install packages.? After the switch, the snapshot R-devel builds 
and binary package builds provided by CRAN will be built using the new 
toolchain for UCRT. These new builds will use UTF-8 as the native 
encoding on recent Windows.

These builds will be incompatible with the previous builds for MSVCRT 
and installed/binary packages will be incompatible as well. The 
recommended/simplest course of action for R-devel users is to uninstall 
the old build of R-devel, RTools, delete the old package libraries, and 
then install the new versions.

Checks of CRAN packages with the new toolchain have been running since 
March with results available on CRAN pages. By now, most packages are 
working, but some packages using native (C, C++, Fortran) code still 
have to be updated. The Winbuilder service and R-hub support the new 
toolchain, there is also support/example for using github actions. The 
builds of R-devel and CRAN (and recommended binary packages) with the 
new toolchain are available regularly since March.

I've created patches for CRAN (and required Bioconductor packages) which 
are installed automatically at package installation time by R. This 
feature will be also in R-devel after the switch and will be used 
temporarily to give package authors more time to fix their packages. Uwe 
Ligges, other CRAN team members and I have also been in touch with some 
package authors, providing advice how to fix their packages, when the 
issues required more explanation. I am prepared to help the remaining 
authors as well if needed.

Please see the blog post and materials linked from there for more 
details and feel free to ask questions.

Thanks
Tomas

Hi Tomas,

I saw that the attached file is missing, I therefore have added it below.

In the examples in your reply from 11/27/21 8:05 PM, you use the command 
'socketSelect(list(con2))'.
I have replaced my Sys.sleep() command with 'socketSelect(list(conn))'.
Execution-time for all the tests has now been reduced to 1.5 seconds!

Thanx

Ben

I am getting the following warnings from devtools:check():

The 00install.out file does not inform me about where, in my R code, 
those warnings were triggered.? I have searched my code for instances of

You import from NAMESPACEs pROC and stats, both offering functions of 
the same name. That means you should only import selectively from these 
NAMESPACEs what you need.

Best,

Could the reason be that you depend on lme4 (and import all of it)
while it Depends: on stats, causing it to be attached [1] when your
package imports it?

Message-ID: <CAO=DOOayQEiiunh=0HrzaYiDHJjgaLQ2EkRFnatsbBL0+YUKYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm having an issue where my vignette created using R CMD build does not
match the vignette created using devtools::build_vignettes or when I knit
with RStudio. I posted about this issue on stack overflow here
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70204611/vignette-table-of-contents-missing-when-package-published-to-cran/70205623?noredirect=1#comment124116982_70205623>.
Originally I thought that this might be related to an omission in the
DESCRIPTION file, but this no longer seems to be the case. Here is a repost
of my initial stack overflow post:

I recently released a vignette with version 1.1 of my R package. The Rmd
for the vignette can be found here
<https://github.com/eweine/qqconf/blob/master/qqconf/vignettes/qqconf_introduction.Rmd>.
When I create the vignette locally, I see author information and the table
of contents at the top of the vignette, as expected. However, when I
submitted this package to CRAN and the vignette was created there
<https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/qqconf/vignettes/qqconf_introduction.html>,
I no longer see the table of contents or author information. Does anyone
know why this may be happening?

Thanks,

Eric.

Eric,

did you check the contents of the package file you submitted? The session info in the vignette is quite old, and the build has been packaged by you so I don't think it has anything to do with CRAN, but to make sure, check the file you submitted.

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, I think the tarball contained an old version of the .html file. 
The timestamp on it is the same as on many other items in the tarball, 
and that likely means it was put into inst/doc by the build process.

Eric, on Github I notice you have a committed copy of the HTML file in 
the vignettes directory.  This could be the cause of your problem. 
Normally you should only have the vignette source in the vignettes 
directory.  I wouldn't be surprised if git the build process thinks the 
.html file is newer than the .Rmd and doesn't rebuild it, putting a 
stale copy into the tarball.

Hello,

Sorry yes, I think that my initial post on stack overflow is a bit
misleading. I have checked the file that is built when I run "R CMD build
...", and it looks like what is on CRAN. The question is why is that
different from when I run "devtools::build_vignette" or when I just knit
the vignette in RStudio. I know that "R CMD build" creates the vignette
each time from scratch. Should I update my R version or something? I'm just
trying to isolate the difference between R CMD build and the other tools I
have to knit vignette so I can ensure they are consistent.

Thanks for the help,

Eric.

Just delete the .html output from earlier runs before you run R CMD 
build, and it will have no choice but to rebuild them.

That does not solve the issue.

First, the html file that's already there is what is desired. But I believe
that regardless R CMD will rebuild the package vignettes from scratch. I
tried removing the html and recreating the package but I end up with the
same result in the .tar.gz file. The central question is why this
difference exists between R CMD and building vignettes otherwise.

Eric.

I suspect you still have a copy of the old .html file, maybe in inst/doc 
if you've removed it from vignettes.  If all your inst/doc files are 
produced from vignettes (which is the recommended way to do things, but 
isn't required) then you shouldn't have inst/doc in the source at all. 
R CMD build will create it when it builds the tarball.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] log4j (CVE-2021-44228) & rJava CRAN pkgs (spoiler: no
 issues!)
Message-ID: <CAA-FpKUtfaD4cctDcinO4JP_A0Ryohk=8W=j_+0vFXO6x3ktow@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

If you haven't heard abt the log4j vuln from Friday yet, I envy you
and def want to know how you managed to do that.

For folks who develop Java-backed packages, pls be aware there's an
arbitrary code execution issue with log4j v2 <= 2.15.0 (NOTE log4j v1
1.x are not impacted).

Thanks to a q by Sir Leeper, I've scanned all of CRAN with ?
https://github.com/mergebase/log4j-detector ? (and looked for the
log4j v2 jar directly) and it's all good, but wanted to let folks know
abt that tool and suggest that you run that in new packages or if you
update your old ones.

The odds of any R environment being impacted by this vulnerability
were super slim (to almost none) to begin with and ? if the tool is
accurate ? it's 0.

This is a technical but rly good Reddit thread on the log4j issue if
folks want some bedtime reading:
