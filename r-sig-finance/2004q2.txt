Thanks again to everybody who participated in the finance sessions at the
recent useR! 2004 conference.  During the discussions, the idea of a mailing
list for R and Finance came up. Thanks to Martin, such a list has now been
created and can be accessed via the page

	https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-finance

from which subscription requests can be made using the usual confirmation
system employed by the mailman software. Everybody interested in 'Finance'
(we will try not to be too picky regarding definitions) and R us cordially
invited to subscribe. Also feel free to forward this message to interested
colleagues. 

With best regards,  Dirk

Kevin,

This is a nice start. I'll Cc this back to the recently formed 'R in
Finance' list we formed as a result of the two Finance sessions at use useR.

One small correction would be that the number of CRAN packages is now in
excess of 350 (not 150). 

And a point you may want to add is that the S language has been used in some
geek corners of Finance for decades; the proximity of Bell Labs to Wall St
may have something to do with that, as does of course the power and elegance
of the language.

S-Plus also offers some fancypants add-on modules, and we'll try hard over
the next few months and years to catch up. A major help in that regard is
Diethelm Wuertz' most excellent Rmetrics collection at

	http://www.rmetrics.org

This is currently windows-only, but Diethelm and I are committed to getting
it into Debian (and my Quantian) so that general Unix/Linux use should fall
out as a side benefit.

Hope this helps, Dirk

I disagree. Peter's book does, as do several of the free pdf files on the R
website.

Having come here from financial/computational econometrics, I'd agree that
the terminology is different. There may not be a command 'ols' in the intro
texts, and you may not find a reference to HAC estimator that is called
Newey-West.

But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Asking Google to look for 'r-help
Newey' as in 
	http://www.google.com/search?q=r-help%20Newey
yields 50 hits (some are doubles, though).

It's all in the main intro book. S being an established language, there are
also many published (i.e. dead tree format) and unpublished texts. E.g. you
could do worse than starting your students off on Pat Burns' 'Guide to the
unwilling S user'. There are several S books to pick from.

That said, I do know that several people agree with your assessment that an
additional R book for Finance would find a market.  I'd expect there to be a
several of those books within a few years. Maybe you'll even write one?

See above: substitute r-help or site:r-project.org for R and you're done.
Last but not least, there _dedicated_ R search engines linked to from the
main site. Did you try those?

Beste Gruesse,  Dirk

PS I'll CC this to r-sig-finance, we can discuss more there.

Subject: [R-sig-finance] Using R in equity research
Message-ID: <20040607000009.28247.qmail@web60306.mail.yahoo.com>

I had been using Minitab in my MBA program at NYU, but
my professor of regression and data analysis Jeff
Simonoff suggested that ambitious students might try
R. I didn't use it for his course but gradually taught
myself to perform regression analysis and diagnostics
with R. 

I'm definitely not from a mathematical/statistical
background. I've been driven to statistics by a desire
to test assumptions I form about fundamental company
research and equity analysis.

Most equity research people tend to not check
diagnostics very well, and thus violate basic
assumptions I think, because they'd rather be
overconfident about their assumptions. That's an
over-generalization though.

I've been doing valuation studies within industries,
looking at how some valuation measures relate to
company characteristics and external factors over
time. My professor suggested using mixed effects
models for such longitudinal data studies, and I don't
have a budget for this sort of thing, so using R and
the NLME package was a natural choice. I think I'm
doing some things with it I haven't seen other
analysts do.  

I notice that most financial users of R and S-Plus
tend to be focused on derivatives and time-series
applications. I haven't seen many approaching time
series data from a multi-factor relationship
perspective. Anyone else seen good applications,
publications on that kind of analysis?

For what I know, it is used fairly extensive in portfolio management (for
equity as well as other portfolio) but I don't have a quick reference I
could point you to for more.  

Suggestions, anyone?

Hello Andrew, Dirk,


a quick Wopec search on "multifactor portfolio* revealed 11 records.
Although not being an equity analyst some entries seem promising; but see

I'm not sure I understand what you are doing, but I've often thought
about doing the following: Suppose you estimate regression models
_within_ a homogeneous industry, where you put P/E or P/B on the
l.h.s. and you use a bunch of firm characteristics as explanatory
variables. Would the outliers be places to take a good look for a
profit opportunity? (Is this what you have in mind?)

The problem with this (AFAICT) is that the cross section of accounting
ratios / data tends to be pretty nasty in terms of
distributions. You'll always have a few weird observations which drive
the result. R might be particularly good at this, by virtue of
bringing a variety of statistical and graphical tools to bear on weird
observations, non-normal distributions, etc.

All this is just guesswork, I haven't actually done it. If you have,
do show us examples?

In short Crusher is an attempt to build a rigorous technical analysis
platform. It is being written in Python and uses RPy to communicate
with R.

I've been on the road a bit and have fallen behind, but we hope to
release 0.0.4 in the next couple of weeks. However, just now R 1.9,
RPy 3.5 and Python 2.3.3 are having some trouble playing nicely with
one another, so that is slowing us down a bit.

Crusher is still in the very early stages of development, so no web
page yet. I don't think we'll go that public until we get to version
0.1. There is an e-mail list--very low traffic. If you like to join
it, drop me a note.

I guess I am missing something in the question since the subject has
been under very intensive study since the seminal paper by Fama and
French where they introduced their three factor model (I don't have the
reference handy, but I guess Google will turn up hundreds of
references). The literature simply exploded since then.

Thanks,
Vadim

Thanks Bernhard,
Yes, I'm familiar with that kind of work. Thanks for
that link to research. I've mostly been looking at
papers at http://www.ssrn.com/ . There must be
hundreds of such analyses related to CAPM theory
alone. I personally have been using R to estimate
company costs of equity using the multifactor
Fama-French approach, and that's pretty simple stuff.
(The main question is how long to go back, whether to
use weekly or monthly returns, and whether to use lm,
wle, or other robust regression methods.)

I'm more thinking of single company or industry
research approaches that equity analysts perform
regularly. I'm looking for something that bridges the
gulf between the typical CFA equity practitioner and
the more statistically advanced, PhD-bearing
mathematical finance researcher. There are many of us,
for example, who read CFA magazine, or Journal of
Portfolio Management, and can somewhat follow along
with the discussion of mathematical procedures in the
article, but would have a difficult time performing
similar research ourselves. There's a big gap between
the research shown in the financial journals and the
research shown in typical sell-side research. I'm
trying to build up quantitative skills without going
back for a PhD.

It seems to me that there are numerous tools available
in R that can be put to good use in more mundane
research tasks, things like determining sensitivities
of earnings to economic growth and interest rates, or
the sensitivity of price to sales ratios to
profitability, leverage, and growth, or using ancova
and time series data to estimate quarterly margins for
a given company or industry. I've not yet seen a
"cookbook" for accomplishing this kind of research.

On the other hand, it's pretty easy to find
discussions relating to derivatives and volatility of
univariate time series. By the way, I have Carol
Alexander's "Market Models," and I found it both
difficult and not of much relevance to the company
fundamentals type work I do in finance. (I'm sure it
would be helpful to me if I worked in derivatives or
ran a quant hedge fund, were I able to really
understand it.)   

Regards,

Quite right, I should have thought a little harder. 

Two financial econometrics books I can recommend (the recent Zivot and Wang
'Modelling Financial Time Series with S-Plus' -- more or less a manual to
S+FinMetrics -- as well as Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay's 'Econometrics of
Financial Markets') each have a chapter on it.  

Andrew: Either one of those should be a good start.

I think the ultimate goal of this kind of research is still to explain 
the cross section of returns, or to differentiate future winners from 
losers.  While you may be interested in earnings, price sales ratios, 
etc, these are really intermediate results.  Once you have these 
numbers, the question is: now that  have better earnings / sales 
estimates, how should I use them?  I would look at this as more of a 
two step problem: 1) trying to obtain better forecasts of earnings, 
etc; 2) using these forecasts to explain the cross section of returns 
ala fama french, or to form portfolios of winners/losers.

There is a lot of research going along these lines, and it is one of 
the reasons Accounting is such a hot field these days.  Much of the 
accounting research is concerned with using fine grained balance sheet 
items as building blocks to better estimates of earnings, residual 
income, return on assets, etc.

I don't have exact references handy (and a lot of what I've read are 
working papers), but some of the names to check out are

Charles Lee (Cornell) - 
http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/profiles/lee/

Stephen Penman (Columbia) - there are specific papers by Ou and Penman, 
and Nassem and Penman
	http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/whoswho/full.cfm?id=55604

David Hirshleifer (Ohio State) - 
http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/faculty/hirshleifer/

I think the Accounting literature is where you will find the gap 
bridged between fundamental "CFA" style analysis and more rigorous 
statistics.

Ajay,
Yes, that's part of what I've been working on lately. 

I cover companies in the industrial and materials
sector. I can't do research just trying to apply the
major academic studies done on large universes, by
increasing my loadings on SMB, HML, earnings
surprises, and putting negative loadings on accruals
(though it's good to keep in mind). That kind of
strategy doesn't work so well within a universe of 30
companies and a 1 year measurement horizon. 

I mostly work on fundamental analysis, and DCF models,
but wanted to supplement that with value-added
relative value analysis. The typical sell-side "based
on average p/e blah blah" is quite weak, so I looked
at what Aswath Damodaran suggested in his valuation
book. He had some basic ideas of performing a
regression on one industry at one point in time,
regressing something like p/e on expected growth and
beta, for example, or ev/ebitda on some other factors.
But then he showed how the results vary widely year to
year, performing separate regressions each year, and
kind of just threw up his hands. 

Fortunately, I've got the Compustat database at work,
and can pull industry data like that for many points
in time, so I can create a longitudinal set of data
for an industry. I first tried piling multiple years
and companies into one big pile and performing a
regression on it, but I knew that would be very bad. I
asked my former NYU professor of regression for advice
on how to tackle such an analysis. He suggested using
mixed-effects models, such as nlme in R, and after
researching it and buying the Bates/Pinheiro book, and
performing some analyses, it definitely makes more
sense using this approach. Then I tie the
relationships that I find into my relative value
models using my fundemental forecasts (stuff like
growth, margins, expected leverage, etc.) as
predicting factors.

I don't expect a tight fit, but just to help make
better informed, more objective valuation estimates,
which tend to be required of a sell-side analyst. 

I definitely have to transform variables, do variable
weightings, look for outliers, check for
autocorrelations, etc. The RCMDR and NLME packages
make these things reasonably easy to do, and the best
thing about R is that I have the code for my study
after its done, so if I have second thoughts, I can go
back in fairly easily.

Many thanks for your suggestion,

I don't know if your suggestion works. I had many problems in 
calculating time
properly and therefore I decided to do it the way I did it, in GMT + 
FinCenter
information. Here comes an example:

In the eighties a trader in Frankfurt is awating the closing prices from 
the Zurich
exchange. When gets he or she the information in local time? It's not 
the same time
in Frankfurt as in Zurich although both cities belong to the same time 
zone! Since
in the eighties Zurich and Frankfurt moved to DST at different dates 
there is a
difference of one hour for some dates!

I know of some other critical examples, and so I decided to work 
internally with
GMT excluding all time zone information. The problem is that Zurich and 
Frankfurt
cannot be distinguished by the time zone alone. One needs more 
information! So
I use for both Zurich and Frankfurt GMT with the (different) DST info 
available from
the timezone database. Otherwise I have to introduce DST-MET (Middle 
European
Time) in several ways for different cities in Europe.

Maybe there is a better solution to such problems ...

The whole timedDate class still needs much more testing ... (I did it to 
some extent
under MS Windows)

I put this on the R-sig-finance discussion list, because I think these 
questions
are of more general interest.

Regards

Diethelm

Time / Date transformations that work for markets are hugely important. For
what I was doing, I got away with what Brian Ripley's new and improve POSIXt
classes offered (since 1.5.* or whenever the first cut appeared) and have
thus defended them publically. To me, they are much better than anything
else that was out there (i.e. date, chron, ...)

However, those classes where not developed with added the complexities of
exchanges in mind.  Gregor posted several rather convincing counter examples
to the R lists, and folks here may have other examples.  This is something
we could discuss quite well here.  Any interest ?

Diethelm: Do you have a pointer into the Rmetrics docs for your current
state of the 'date / time' world?  Could you summarize strength and (if any
:-) weaknesses?

Hello and thank you.  I look forward to using the new packages under both
Win32 as well as FreeBSD.

Quick question.  Any chance this package collection could be added, say, as
a new category under the package directory at http://cran.us.r-project.org/?
Perhaps it's not appropriate and/or not the scope as this area is under a
non-traditional category.  (Although, I think that's one of the aims of this
forum is to introduce R to an additional audience.)  Anyway, I thought I'd
ask/propose the idea.

Thanks,
Charles

I would like to clarify my suggestion.

My suggestion was simply how to implement the current functionality
without making the user set environment variables.

Whether time zones are important or not does not seem to be 
relevant to that discussion since I was not proposing to change
any outward functionality -- just how to implement the existing
functionality in more convenient way.

It's been planned all along to get this to CRAN once 'R CMD check' passed,
and no dependencies remain on non-Open/Free Source code.

Diethelm,

OK, so I'm knew to R and Linux.  How do I build this?  My guess is that I
have to download the R source (instead of just the binaries) and rebuild R.
Is this correct?  If not, some guidance would be helpful.

No, it is much easier due to the modular package system design.  For any
given CRAN package from   

	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/

you have two easy choices. Let's take its as a simple example

1)  Download the latest tar.gz, i.e. its_1.0.3.tar.gz
    Simply install it by saying
    	$ R CMD INSTALL its_1.0.3.tar.gz
    which will do whatever is needed.  Note that for packages with source
    code in C, C++, Fortan, you do need to have the required compilers, 
    headers, ... as well as any external libraries. You probably also need
    to do this as root due to write permissions.
    
2)  Do it from inside R (also preferaby as root)

        > install.packages("its")
	
If you are runninging Debian, you get a third choice:

        $ apt-get install r-cran-its
	
Now, back to Rmetrics. Given that these are not yet on CRAN, you are
probably best served by 1) and a download of the sources followed by 'R CMD
INSTALL ...'.

Hope this helps, and good luck,

Dirk

Diethelm,

I used 1).  First I had to upgrade R v1.9.0 and then get a copy of the g77
compiler.  After that it worked fine.  I'm looking forward to trying it out.

Hi

Was discussing this with a colleague today and wondering what other 
people thought - how popular is R (or S-Plus) in quantitative finance 
compared to matlab?  (I know SAS probably beats both of them for 
non-computational finance work).  Any strong opinions on why R is 
better/worse than matlab?

thanks,

FYI: I asked the very same question on the r-help mailing list
approx. a month ago.  You will find a lot of good opinions about this
in the archives of that list.

In my experience versions of S are much more prevalent
than matlab in equities, while matlab is more prevalent than
S in fixed income.  However, S does seem to be making
some inroads into fixed income.

I can explain this by observing that

1)  fixed income is mathematical as well as statistical.

2)  matlab was available before S.

3)  for reasons way beyond my capabilities, it has only been
in recent years that more than a handful of people have thought
that finance is a statistical subject.

This depends on the generally accepted axiom:
matlab is better suited to mathematics, S is better suited to statistics.

Googling for 'cointegration R' reveals:
http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/.R/library/urca/html/00Index.html

It also shows:
http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/.R/library/tseries/html/po.test.html

In short: sniff at the `tseries' and `urca' packages, both of which
are terrific products.

"timeDate" and "timeSeries" implement objects which are in some sense 
SPlus like concerning
the command structure, but very different in the underlying concept.

Internally all dates are POSIX dates which are handled in the "pure" GMT 
time zone excluding
daylight saving rules. This makes time and date management unique. So 
you have to find a way
to work within R  with GMT and no DST! The rest is done by the financial 
center concept. The
idea behind it is, that you have 1) the place where you recorded the 
data (handled by the argument
zone) and 2) where you use the data, this is handled by the  argument  
FinCenter.  The information
on DST is retrieved from the Ical date and tables.

For example, within this concept you can handle data records from around 
1980 when
Frankfurt and Zurich had different DST rules although they belong to the 
same time zone!

If you don't move internally in R to GMT without DST there can be 
created interferences and the
date conversions can become wrong, to remember this, you get the warnings!

Diethelm Wuertz

Subject: [R-sig-finance] Rmetrics in Quantian, and packages for Debian
Message-ID: <20040629023947.GA5538@sonny.eddelbuettel.com>


Just a quick note to say that I created Debian packages from the four
components packages of Rmetrics. These are currently available at 

	http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rmetrics/
	
along with the changes, diff, sources and dsc files. These Debian packages
should get uploaded to Debian 'in the near future' -- as soon as Diethelm is
happy enough for them to be included in CRAN.

In the meantime, they are also included in Quantian 0.5.9.2 which I released
earlier today, see

	http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/
	
[ Quantian is a Knoppix-derivative for numbers nerds and includes extensive
support for R, as well as about 1gb (uncompressed) of other quantitative
software. Current Quantian images, while too large for cdroms at 1.2gb, can
be booted from both Windows or Linux partitions using clusterKnoppix as a
boot cdrom. Those with dvd burners can burn bootable dvds; those without can
order them pre-made for a nominal fee -- see the Quantian pages for details. ]
