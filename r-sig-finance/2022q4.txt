Similar thing with getSymbols('DGS3MO',src='FRED').

They both download correctly directly from FRED.

Hi Frank,

These both work for me in R-4.2.1 and quantmod 0.4.20. It looks like
you're using quantmod <= 0.4.18.

What R version are you using? At minimum, you should reinstall the
packages that were built in R-3.5.3 in March-2019.

Best,
Josh

Hi Josh,

schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE
(0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is
received (e.g. handshake failed).

This looks like a problem (not a bug in getSymbols) with the TLS
cipher suites. Try direct curl/libcurl. I think you will get the same
error.

Best,
Daniel

I upgraded to R 4.2.2. I also installed quantmod, TTR, chron and a few other packages. I'm getting the same 

Error in getSymbols.FRED(Symbols = "SP500", env = <environment>, verbose = FALSE,  : 
  Unable to import "SP500".
schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed).
Calls: getSymbols -> do.call -> getSymbols.FRED
Execution halted

Error message. I was running code last week that had been upgraded for the switch from http: to https: on FRED. Probably r 4.0.5.

Thanks,

Error message. I was running code last week that had been upgraded for the switch from http: to https: on FRED. Probably r 4.0.5.

Thanks,

Hi Josh,

schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE
(0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed).

This looks like a problem (not a bug in getSymbols) with the TLS cipher suites. Try direct curl/libcurl. I think you will get the same error.

Best,
Daniel

Dear JarnoPerhaps you could try adding Trace = TRUE argument in your optimize.portfolio.rebalancing call.

 Hello everyone,?I am currently trying to run an out-of-sample-optimization with the PortfolioAnalytics package, where the quadratic utility function of the investor also penalizes transaction costs (40bps) through the numeric solver. The vignette states that this can be implemented via a constraint that is supported for quadratic utility maximization using the ROI solver. However, this does not work for me. I have the following exemplary code:?library(xts)
library(PortfolioAnalytics)
library(ROI)
library(quadprog)
options(scipen = 999)?data("edhec")
returns = edhec[, 1:3]
colnames(returns) = c("CA", "CTAG", "DS")?port <- portfolio.spec(assets = colnames(returns))
port <- add.constraint(port, "long_only")
port <- add.constraint(port, "weight_sum", min_weight = 1, max_weight = 1)
port <- add.constraint(port, "transaction_cost", ptc = 0.004)
port <- add.objective(port, type = "risk", name = "var", risk_aversion = 10)
port <- add.objective(port, type = "return", name = "mean")?opt_TC = optimize.portfolio.rebalancing(R = returns, portfolio = port, optimize_method = "ROI", rebalance_on = "months", training_period = 100, rolling_window = NULL)?rr_TC = Return.portfolio(returns, weights = extractWeights(opt_TC))
charts.PerformanceSummary(rr_TC)
chart.Weights(opt_TC)??When I run this code without the transaction cost constraint it works fully as intended. However, if I run it with the TC constraint, I suddenly receive the following error messages:> charts.PerformanceSummary(rr_TC)
Error in `[.xts`(x, start.row, 1) : subscript out of bounds
> chart.Weights(opt_TC)
Error in plot.window(xlim, ylim, log = log, ...) :?
? need finite 'ylim' values?It does work with the "DEoptim" solver (although the solutions somehow look strange to me), but I would want to run it using the ROI solver, which should be possible as I understand it. Has someone had a similar problem and was able to fix it??Kind regards,?

R/Finance 2023: Applied Finance with R
May 19 and 20, 2023
University of Illinois at Chicago

Call for Presentations

The fifteenth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R
will be held on May 19 and 20, 2023 in Chicago, IL, at the University
of Illinois at Chicago. The conference will cover topics including
advanced risk tools, decentralized finance, econometrics,
high-performance computing, market microstructure, portfolio
management, and time series analysis. All will be discussed within the
context of using R and other programming languages as primary tools
for financial model development, portfolio construction, risk
management, and trading.

>From its humble Midwest beginnings, word of the conference spread
among trading desks and universities, until it became the primary
meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in
quantitative finance. The conference has featured presentations from
prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another
exciting line-up for 2023.

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format for
consideration. We will also consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf
format) although more complete papers are preferred. We welcome
submissions for full talks (approximately 20 min.), abbreviated
"lightning talks" (approx. 6 min.), as well as (1 hr.) pre-conference
tutorials. (Scheduling considerations may require requested full talks
moved to lightning). Both academic and practitioner proposals related
to R are encouraged.

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time.
Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to
accompany the slides. Ideally, data sets should be made public for the
purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due
to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to innovative
research or presenters who have released R packages.

Please submit proposals online
https://go.uic.edu/RFinanceCFP2023

Limited financial assistance for conference admission may be available
to presenters. As R/Finance is a volunteer open source effort from
which organizers do not profit, resources are derived from
registrations and sponsorship alone. Requests for financial assistance
must be made at the time of submission, and the presenter should
clearly communicate to us why assistance is being requested. We
particularly welcome requests from underrepresented minorities in
Quantitative Finance/STEM, and anyone researching under economic
hardship.

Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a
final submission deadline of January 27, 2023. Submitters will be
notified via email starting February 15, 2023 of acceptance and
presentation length.

Additional details will be announced via the conference website
http://www.RinFinance.com/ as they become available. Information on
previous years' presenters and their presentations are also at the
conference website. We will make a separate announcement when
registration opens, in late March.

For the conference committee:
Ferhat Akbas, Rabia Sipahi Akbas, Petra Bakosova, Gib Bassett, Peter
Carl, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Soumya Kalra, Brian Peterson, Dale Rosenthal,
Jeffrey Ryan, Justin Shea, and Joshua Ulrich.
