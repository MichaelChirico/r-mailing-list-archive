Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Fit skewed-t distribution
Message-ID: <CAP3yu5_ySAYmLM=A2yBieK1oGboWD2CUOpnBMApxhdcpkTCRkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys!

Could someone suggest any package to estimates parameters of skewed-t
distribution?
I didn't manage to find any.

Thanks!

My personal favorite for the skewed Student's-t distribution family is
the 'sn' package.

There is also the 'skewt' package, but as I recall this only has
p/d/q/r functions, and does not contain a 'fit' function to fit from
existing data.

There are a couple of packages that do multivariate skew-t models as
well.

Brian

Here is my piece about US equity market corrections:

I'll greatly appreciate your comments.

I think that this is correct.  NASDAQ was still in a drawdown.  NASDAQ
didn't make new all-time highs until 2014.

Some people define 'corrections' as drawdown from most recent peak.
Charles Schwab's definition is in-line with generally accepted usage:

https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.schwab.com%2Fresource-center%2Finsights%2Fcontent%2Fmarket-correcti&amp;data=02%7C01%7Caschmid1%40stevens.edu%7C104e1f582d6242bfce0208d6758a227a%7C8d1a69ec03b54345ae21dad112f5fb4f%7C0%7C0%7C636825633496698033&amp;sdata=rkHsOOY4EdLB9LUu4bomU4%2F98T3kHidzSJY%2BGEQ4NsI%3D&amp;reserved=0
on-what-does-it-mean

The Motley Fool uses a similar but not identical definition:

https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.schwab.com%2Fresource-center%2Finsights%2Fcontent%2Fmarket-correcti&amp;data=02%7C01%7Caschmid1%40stevens.edu%7C104e1f582d6242bfce0208d6758a227a%7C8d1a69ec03b54345ae21dad112f5fb4f%7C0%7C0%7C636825633496698033&amp;sdata=rkHsOOY4EdLB9LUu4bomU4%2F98T3kHidzSJY%2BGEQ4NsI%3D&amp;reserved=0
on-what-does-it-mean

quantmod has a 'findPeaks' function, but this is dependent on you
setting a threshold for what defines a peak.

A related Stack Overflow question may provide something in the
direction of what you're looking for to look at drawdown from a recent
peak.

https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F14737899%2Fcalculate-cumulatve-growth&amp;data=02%7C01%7Caschmid1%40stevens.edu%7C104e1f582d6242bfce0208d6758a227a%7C8d1a69ec03b54345ae21dad112f5fb4f%7C0%7C0%7C636825633496708038&amp;sdata=R9gkq2ILuqhdJQpjyijXw%2Flmogrxto8WP%2BvV05K6lgo%3D&amp;reserved=0
-drawdown-from-local-min-max

I would certainly be happy to include a 'findCorrections' function in a
later version of PerformanceAnalytics if we could parameterize what
constitutes a 'recent high' for that purpose.

Brian

Alec,
Very interesting paper.  Thanks for sharing the results of your
thoughts on this topic.
I note that you reference 'forecast' and 'rugarch' but do not place
them in your references.  They should appear in your
bibliography.  Also, it would be good if you could post the R code
somewhere so that an interested reader could replicate your analysis.
Regards,

Brian,
I added references for 'forecast' and 'rugarch'. As for my script, It's a 'spagetti' without comments, which I can share privately.

Best, Alec

I think that this is correct.  NASDAQ was still in a drawdown.  NASDAQ
didn't make new all-time highs until 2014.

Some people define 'corrections' as drawdown from most recent peak.
Charles Schwab's definition is in-line with generally accepted usage:

The Motley Fool uses a similar but not identical definition:

quantmod has a 'findPeaks' function, but this is dependent on you
setting a threshold for what defines a peak.

A related Stack Overflow question may provide something in the
direction of what you're looking for to look at drawdown from a recent
peak.

https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F14737899%2Fcalculate-cumulatve-growth&amp;data=02%7C01%7Caschmid1%40stevens.edu%7C104e1f582d6242bfce0208d6758a227a%7C8d1a69ec03b54345ae21dad112f5fb4f%7C0%7C0%7C636825633496708038&amp;sdata=R9gkq2ILuqhdJQpjyijXw%2Flmogrxto8WP%2BvV05K6lgo%3D&amp;reserved=0<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F14737899%2Fcalculate-cumulatve-growth&data=02%7C01%7Caschmid1%40stevens.edu%7C724de3b1f0d74e20969b08d6b6b822e0%7C8d1a69ec03b54345ae21dad112f5fb4f%7C0%7C0%7C636897299336552468&sdata=llnqD8ZdgOYjNxI9b8TLI1euc2TxZpiA3jQc%2FD9A2Vk%3D&reserved=0>

I would certainly be happy to include a 'findCorrections' function in a
later version of PerformanceAnalytics if we could parameterize what
constitutes a 'recent high' for that purpose.

Brian

Hi,

in this small code piece, the return stock prices are default to daily but
intended to be in weekly or monthly format:

for(symbol in symbols){ # establish trade-able instruments
? ? stock(symbol, currency="USD",multiplier=1)
??? getSymbols(symbol)
}

One way to do that is use to.weekly() function. The issue is symbol (say,
symbol = "SPY") is a character class, not "xts zoo" class so
to.weekly(symbol) would incur errors. to.weekly(SPY) is fine. When the
symbols list is long, this'd become annoying.?

So are there better to convert daily price to weekly/monthly?

Thanks

This may be an approximation:

for(symbol in symbols){ # establish trade-able instruments
    stock(symbol, currency="USD",multiplier=1)
    ticker <- getSymbols(symbol, auto.assign = F)
    assign(paste0(symbol, ?_daily"), ticker)
    ticker <-  to_weekly(ticker)
    assign(paste0(symbol, ?_weekly"), ticker)
}

Maybe the package BatchGetSymbols may help you. The main function
(BatchGetSymbols) has a parameter for data frequency.

I am relatively new to analyzing financial data but have some experience with R. I understand that the data available from Yahoo Finance via its API is often questionable in quality and Google Finance is no longer available.

Although Googling pointed me to some other sources such as Quandl etc., I am curious which other data sources quantmod itself supports for data retrieval, ie via an API, not via downloading and importing CSV-files?

My interest is really US equities, stock options and ETFs - if possible from the same data source...

Pointers to favorite data sources appreciated!

Thank you.

quantmod supports multiple data sources, both paid and free.

The documentation is installed with the package or you can find a pdf here:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/quantmod.pdf

The code is here:
https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/blob/master/R/getSymbols.R

For free daily data sources, I usually use Tiingo or Quandl in my public 
talks.  These certainly have US equities and ETF's.

Especially for intraday data, expect to have to pay for it.  We have had 
good luck with IQFeed on the low end of the cost scale. I am not aware 
of a simple online source for historical options data.  Also, check if 
your broker has an API.  e.g. Interactive Brokers(IB), TD Ameritrade, 
and Fidelity (at least) all have programmatic ways of retrieving data.

IB has an R package, as does Quandl.

For CSV data sources that would be downloaded from online, you can bring 
them directly into R without having to go through the intermediary step 
of saving the file to your local disk. R's data functions can use a url 
as a handle to open a data stream (this is how quantmod's downloaders 
work, see the code above).

Regards,

Brian

Thank you. I have not reviewed the code but did not find a mention of any other data source besides Yahoo in the PDF-file but it is possible I missed it?

eodhistoricaldata.com

API. Not free. Stock prices $20/mo, option in all-in-one package $50/mo. Not sure which module allows access to API.

iextrading.com

API. Seems to be free but will only include IEX data starting June. R module at https://github.com/imanuelcostigan/iex.

barchart.com

API. Did not find information on any R module.

tiingo.com

API. Did not see options on the website. Not sure which module allows access to API.

quantco.com

No information on website.

fidelity.com

Somebody mentioned Fidelity where I have an account. I did, however, not find any information on their website about API and R. Does anyone know?

Any other sites?

I looked into IQFeed for intraday stock data, and unfortunately they only
provide historical 1-minute data for stocks that are currently traded. This
is not good enough for one of the strategies I'm working on.

I am looking into other alternatives and will post my findings in this
thread.

Please let me know if you have other suggestions for historical intraday
stock data covering the S&P 500.

polygon.io - 6Y tick by tick history. $399/m if you are a pro (it's
rather cheap)
https://polygon.io/stocks

TradingPhysics - milliseconds resolution. You pay per symbol, but it
is often cheaper than buying the whole market data. They offer a lot
of HFT indicators if you want to be very active.
http://www.tradingphysics.com/Feeds/AvailableFeeds.aspx
http://www.tradingphysics.com/Resources/Specifications/HistoricalTimeAndSales.aspx

ActiveTick - 1-minute resolution or tick data (original, unfiltered
and unmodified format)
https://www.activetick.com/activetick/contents/MarketDataServicesDevelopers.aspx

Take into account that if you want to have regular time series, the
database in seconds or milliseconds will be huge.

Best regards,
Daniel

Looks very promising. They go further back for 1-minute data, but they said
that there is still some missing data for unlisted stocks which they expect
to have added over the next few weeks.

Very impressive looking, but it appears to only go back to 2015.

The Rblpapi team is happy to announce version 0.3.10 of the package with a
significant enhancement contributed by Al Kanzler: bpipe support.

You can get this version from the ghrr drat repo, see

   http://ghrr.github.io/drat/

for details.

We uploaded this to CRAN four days ago; the package has no NOTE, WARNING or
ERROR apart from one NOTE about StagedInstall from R 3.6.0 we can do nothing
about given the need for the rpath linker registration of the Bloomberg API
shared library. We asked repeatedly about the status; of course we have yet
to receive as much as a single character in return.

This behaviour by CRAN is rather unsatisfying, but there is also little we
can do about it besides offering the package another way -- as we do here via
the 'ghrr' drat repo hosted on GitHub. As frustrating as it is, CRAN too is
operated by volunteers so it is what it is.

Enjoy,  Dirk

As a follow-up, after five days of giving it the 'silent treatment' the

Hi Steve,

I have never worked with RobinHood, but I have analyzed the code of
this package. Maybe my insights will be useful for you.

RobinHood, as well as Alpaca Markets, operate in the PFOF model
(payment for order flow). Your order does not go public, but is sold
to market makers. Is it good or bad? Currently, the PFOF model is
regulated by Regulation NMS[1] - your order must be filled at a price
equal to or better than the NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) or best
price rule in short. In fact, most brokers work in the PFOF model too
- you pay a commission, but they sell your orders anyway. So RH and
Alpaca are fair here - if we make money from selling your order, you
do not pay commissions anymore. I explain this because I have noticed
that many people don't understand the RH and Alpaca's business model.

[1] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulation-nms.asp

As for this R package, it works in the request-response model. It's
not the best pattern for algo trading. Your application will have to
work in the so-called batch model:

repeat {
    get_mktdata()
    get_positions()
    calc_model_and_risk()
    place_orders()
    sleep(x_min_or_even_more)
}

This is inefficient, so this solution is only suitable for very slow
models. It's difficult to manage the execution, so you should place
orders type of market.

The best pattern for algo trading is event-driven. Here you subscribe
to data stream (events) and your application responds to every new
message. IBrokers is written in this model:

https://github.com/joshuaulrich/IBrokers/blob/master/vignettes/RealTime.pdf

Your minimal strategy should look like this:

subscribe(c('AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GS'))

on_tick <- function()
{
    (...)
    place_order(...)
}

on_order <- function()
{
    # accepted, rejected etc.
}

on_exec <- function()
{
}

on_system_event <- function()
{
}

# main event loop
run_strategy(host = 'api_server', port = 123, daemon = TRUE)


place_order() means submit  and subscribe orders events.

>From what I see, RobinHood R package wasn't designed to work in such
an event-driven model.

I hope that will be helpful for you.

Best regards,
Daniel

I still have not been able to contact them, so I will give up if I don't

I have read some bad things about CQFG and their "affiliate" QuantQuote.
For example:

https://github.com/michaelsmusing/sources-for-intraday-historical-stock-data

It looks to me like AlphaVantage only has intraday stock data going back a
couple of weeks.

Hi,

I wanted to build and implement some of the strategies for stock selection
using Quant methods and Machine Learning methods. Since many days i was
searching on the web but, could not find an useful research papers for the
same.

Could you please suggest some excellent research papers/ some best research
websites/ blogs where i can read methods and strategies ?

Thank You,

Announcement below:

Please join us at the 11th annual R/Finance Conference!  As in prior
years, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world. R
users from industry, academia, and government will joining 50+
presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  The conference will
take place on May 17th and 18th, at UIC in Chicago.

You can find registration information on the conference website:
https://go.uic.edu/rfinance2019

Note that registration fees will increase by 50% at the end of early
registration on May 6, 2019.

We are very excited about keynote presentations by Genevera Allen,
Arthur Steinmetz, and Matt Taddy.  The conference agenda (currently)
includes 25 full presentations and 25 shorter "lightning talks".  As
in previous years, several (optional) pre-conference seminars are
offered on Friday morning.  We're still working on the agenda, but we
have another great lineup of speakers this year!

There is also an (optional) conference dinner at Wyndham Grand Chicago
Riverfront in the 39th Floor Penthouse Ballroom and Terrace.  Situated
directly on the riverfront, it is a perfect venue to continue
conversations and networking.

On behalf of the committee, we look forward to seeing you in Chicago!

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Question on cgarchsim with external regressors
References: <1891953663.1699242.1555320559089.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1891953663.1699242.1555320559089@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone,
I want to use external regressors in the univariate GARCH mean specification in a Copula-GARCH Model (But I get the same problems with DCC-GARCH).
(From the rmgarch Vignette p. 28) To provide a list (equal to the number of asset) of matrices of simulated external regressorin-mean data with row length equal to n.sim + n.start I first simulate data for the stocks "AXP", "BA" and "BAC" as external regressors (just as an example). 
However, the use of the data only works in the univariate case within the univariate mean specification, not in the multivariate case. 
Unfortunately I can not correctly specify mexsimdata for the multivariate case. I always get the following error message:
"Error in .simregressors(model, mexsimdata, vexsimdata, N, n, m.sim, m) : 
ugarchsim-->error: mexsimdata should be a list of length m.sim"
But length(k) (k is my specification for mexsimdata, see below) is 100 and is therefore equal to the length of m.sim, since n.start=0. 
I have tried other specifications, but I do not know exactly what is missing or what I am doing wrong.
The same error message also appears when using dccspec, dccfit and dccsim for the DCC-GARCH model instead of the copula-DCC.
The use of external regressors for the variance equation also causes the same error message, only then for vexsimdata.
Do I try to use the package in a way it is not intended for?

 Thanks for your help in advance,Daniel

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Error with presigma in rugarch package
Message-ID: <154A5CE7-0188-4D7A-BBAF-4431E4256C39@gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm new here, so please excuse me for violation of local rules, if this
happens. 

First, I've seen this problem here, it is more or less the same:
http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/RUGARCH-bootstrap-fitting-error-presigma-length-td4634470.html <http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/RUGARCH-bootstrap-fitting-error-presigma-length-td4634470.html> 
However, I have the newest version (I suppose so) 1.4-1 of rugarch package,
and the error is still in place. I think, there is a problem with my code
then. So, any help would be appreciated greatly. 

I'm trying to forecast some financial returns with so-called copula-garch
method. When I run the code woth ARMA(1,1) - it's ok, but with ARMA(2+, q)
it returns:
"Error in .sgarchpath2(spec = spec, n.sim = n.sim, n.start = n.start, m.sim
= m.sim,  : 
ugarchpath-->error: presigma must be of length 2"

Here is the simulation part of the code (originally taken from here with
minor changes of distribution model and a bit more:
http://www.unstarched.net/r-examples/rugarch/simulated-rolling-forecast-density/ <http://www.unstarched.net/r-examples/rugarch/simulated-rolling-forecast-density/>)


specm <- ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="sGARCH", garchOrder=c(1,1),

                   mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(2,1), include.mean=TRUE), 
distribution.model = 'std')
fsim <-  matrix(NA, ncol = 60, nrow = 5000)
# we will also create the closed form forecast
afor <-  matrix(NA, ncol = 60, nrow = 2)
rownames(afor) <-  c('Mu', 'Sigma')
colnames(afor) = colnames(fsim) = rep(paste('T+', 1:10, sep = ''), 6)
# T+1 we can use ugarchsim:
for (i in 0:5) {
 fit <-  ugarchfit(specm, returns[1:405, i+1])
 specf <- ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="sGARCH", garchOrder=c(1,1),
submodel = NULL),
                     mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(2,1), include.mean=TRUE), 
distribution.model = 'std', fixed.pars = as.list(coef(fit)))

 fsim[, (1+10*i)] = as.numeric(fitted(tmp))
 tmp <-  ugarchforecast(fit, n.ahead = 1)

}
### 
# for T+(i>1):

 specf <- ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="sGARCH", garchOrder=c(1,1),

                     mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(2,1), include.mean=TRUE),

 for (i in 2:10) {
   filt <-  ugarchfilter(specf, data = returns[1:(405 + i - 1), j+1], n.old

   path <-  ugarchpath(specf, n.sim = 1, m.sim = 5000, presigma =
tail(sigma(filt),
                                                                       1),
prereturns = returns[(405 + i - 1), j+1], preresiduals =
tail(residuals(filt),

1), custom.dist = list(name = 'sample', distfit = t(new_res[,j+1])))
   fsim[, i+10*j] <-  as.numeric(fitted(path))
   tmp <-  ugarchforecast(specf, returns[1:(405 + i - 1), j+1], n.ahead =
1)
   afor[, i+10*j] <- c(fitted(tmp), sigma(tmp)) 
 }
}

Hope, my point is clear! Thank you in advance!

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] ugarchroll with moving window - failed to invert
 hessian
Message-ID: <CAPUT4M5sAES8hBU-91TDi+b2vbPyzaGhSCHeUBkNM9EBtAxqoA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm currently finishing my master thesis in Forecasting with ARMA-GARCH
models but I'm having some trouble forecasting with moving windows using
ugarchroll.

I'm trying to run the following code:

# GARCH(1,1) - t-student
specgarch11n = ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0,0),
include.mean = TRUE, archm=TRUE, archpow=2),
                          variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH",
garchOrder=c(1,1)),
                          distribution.model = "std")
specgarch11n
fitgarch11n <- ugarchfit(specgarch11n, data = returns_eurusd)
fitgarch11n

 #---Moving Window Forecast---
 forecast1 <- ugarchroll(specgarch11n, n.ahead = 1, forecast.length = 1507,
refit.window = "moving", window.size = 250, refit.every = 250,
                        data = returns_eurusd, solver = "hybrid")
 View(forecast1 at forecast$density$Sigma)

After running it I get the following error:

Warning messages:
1: In .makefitmodel(garchmodel = "sGARCH", f = .sgarchLLH, T = T, m = m,  :
  rugarch-->warning: failed to invert hessian

2: In .makefitmodel(garchmodel = "sGARCH", f = .sgarchLLH, T = T, m = m,  :
  rugarch-->warning: failed to invert hessian

3: In .makefitmodel(garchmodel = "sGARCH", f = .sgarchLLH, T = T, m = m,  :
  rugarch-->warning: failed to invert hessian

4: In .rollfdensity(spec = spec, data = data, n.ahead = n.ahead,
forecast.length = forecast.length,  :
  non-converged estimation windows present...resubsmit object with
different solver parameters...

I have tried to follow Alexios suggestions on this post but nothing seems
to work:
http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/rugarch-package-quot-Warning-Message-quot-for-GARCH-Normal-td4643515.html

Can someone please help me solving this issue?

 Statistical Methods for Stochastic Process [final announcement]
Message-ID: <580DAF00-FD5E-4B9F-A7C6-6057B0A6998B@unimi.it>

YSS2019: The first YUIMA Summer School on Computational and Statistical Methods for Stochastic Process
25-28 June 2019, Brixen-Bressanone, Italy

This 4 days course aims at introducing researchers, PhD students and practitioners to several aspects of numerical and statistical analysis of time series through the R language and, in particular, the YUIMA package.

Who can benefit?
Stochastic differential equations, with or without jumps, are nowadays used as statistical models in many contexts, including but not limited to, finance, insurance, phylogenetics, genomics, political analysis, economics, migration flow analysis, social network analysis, and more. 

Topics
The course covers topics of R programming, time series data handling, simulation and numerical analysis for several types of statistical models including: point processes, stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion with or without jumps, fractional Brownian motion and L?vy processes.

For detailed information see the course page at:  
https://yuimaproject.com/yss2019/ 

Registration closes on May 20th 2019!

PhD Students and PostDocs can attend for free. Limited availability. Access rule: FIFO.

I have downloaded option chains daily, for over a year, using a cronjob with Rscript. But a few days ago, I got this error:

"

I'd like some help with this error. My code is below

-------

symbols <- as.character( read.csv("list_OPTIONS.txt", header=FALSE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[,1] )
options <- sapply(symbols, function(s) getOptionChain(s, Exp=NULL, src='yahoo'))
rdsFilename <- paste0("opt_", format(Sys.Date(),"%Y%m%d"), ".rds")
saveRDS(options, rdsFilename)

This had been reported: https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/issues/266

I could replicate the issue yesterday, but did not had time to
investigate.  I tried to run the example again today, and it worked.

Thanks for the example.  Next time, please provide a reproducible
example that others can run.  We don't have your file
(list_OPTIONS.txt).

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Fwd: model confidence sets in R
In-Reply-To: <CAK9NgGx_ZQHf5omtAjympUPc5ShY2LZU_e9KrrG57YkWvjHDyw@mail.gmail.com>

There are at least three different packages implementing the Model
Confidence Set (MCS) procedure of Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2011). These
three packages, however, produce very different MCS p-values and rather
different superior model sets.

To illustrate, I'm including the following minimal working example. Code is
also available at the following link:
https://gist.github.com/sjvrensburg/57c325f62c52b9df56c82ca41f81de28

#####################################################
require(MCS)
require(rugarch)
require(modelconf)
require(parallel)
require(dplyr)

cl <- makeForkCluster(nnodes = 8)   # Running Linux, so can fork.
data(Loss)        # Loss data from the MCS package
loss_mat <- as.matrix(Loss[, 1:10]) # mcsTest requires a "plain" matrix
model_names <- colnames(loss_mat)

# Parameters for functions...
alpha <- 0.2
B <- 50000        # Make this big, in order to reduce the variability.
block_len <- 33   # Block length calculated as in MCS package.

# Calculate MCS using various packages. Takes a while...
set.seed(123456)
rugarch_pkg <- mcsTest(losses = loss_mat, alpha = alpha, nboot = B,
                       nblock = block_len, boot = "block")
set.seed(123456)
mcs_pkg <- MCSprocedure(Loss = loss_mat, alpha = alpha, B = B,
                        statistic = 'TR', k = block_len, cl = cl)
set.seed(123456)
modelconf_pkg <- estMCS(loss = loss_mat, test = "t.range", B = B,
                        l = block_len)
stopCluster()

# Extract and format results for comparison.
rugarch_results <- cbind(Model = model_names[c(rugarch_pkg$excludedR,
                                               rugarch_pkg$includedR)],
                         pval = rugarch_pkg$pvalsR)

mcs_results <- mcs_pkg at show %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  cbind(Model = row.names(mcs_pkg at show), .) %>%
  select(Model, MCS_R) %>%
  arrange(MCS_R)

modelconf_results <- modelconf_pkg %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  cbind(Model = row.names(modelconf_pkg), .) %>%
  select(Model, `MCS p-val`) %>%
  arrange(`MCS p-val`)

# Inspect results
#   rugarch: Only sGARCH-ghyp & sGARCH-sged in SSM
print(tail(rugarch_results, 5))
# Model
# [6,] "sGARCH-sstd"  "0.06714"
# [7,] "sGARCH-snorm" "0.06714"
# [8,] "sGARCH-jsu"   "0.06714"
# [9,] "sGARCH-ghyp"  "0.33244"
# [10,] "sGARCH-sged"  "1"

#   MCS: only returns SSM, which includes 7 models.
print(tail(mcs_results, 5))
# 3  sGARCH-ghyp 0.82144
# 4   sGARCH-ged 0.96256
# 5   eGARCH-std 0.96704
# 6 sGARCH-snorm 0.99584
# 7  sGARCH-sged 1.00000

#   modelconf: SSM includes 7 models.
print(tail(modelconf_results, 5))
# Model MCS p-val
# 6   sGARCH-ghyp   0.70332
# 7    sGARCH-ged   0.87124
# 8  sGARCH-snorm   0.87124
# 9    eGARCH-std   0.87124
# 10  sGARCH-sged   1.00000
#######################################################

In all cases, p-values are based on the range statistic T_R.

The superior set of models (SSM) produced by the MCS and modelconf packages
are the same, but the MCS p-values are quite different. The rank of models
in the SSM are also different. The SSM produced by the rugarch package
differs drastically, and contains only two models.

Differences in p-values are to be expected, since these procedures are
based on the bootstrap. However, given the large number of bootstrap
replications, surely the differences should be small? Also, notice the
repetition or ties in p-values with the results from mcsTest and estMCS.

Am I doing something wrong or misinterpreting the documentation? Does any
one else use any of these procedures? Which do you prefer and recommend? I
was, initially, planning on using the MCS package. But I don't like that it
only returns the SSM. That's when I started looking at alternatives, and
now I'm totally confused!

Any help, whatsoever, would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

Apologies, small error in the code. stopCluster() was called without
supplying the cluster object, cl, to the function. Corrected on my gist:

Dear all,
in "dccspec" it's possible to fit a VAR model for the conditional mean
using the VAR = TRUE keyword.
My question is: how does this option relates to the conditional mean
specification that is required from the uGARCHmultispecobject?
Thanks a lot!

In the case of VAR, the univariate specification for the conditional 
mean should be set to not estimate anything i.e. include.mean=FALSE and 
armaOrder=c(0,0).

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] some additional questions on rmgarch
Message-ID: <CADRZJuHd64eoFzC5LuasywOsMtXxVhL0dQEcuOwkeY07Y-=ukw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Alexios,
thank you very much for your prompt reply!
If you don't mind, I would have some more technical questions on dccfit:
1. how can I access the results of the VAR estimation from a dccfit object?
2. what type of values are required by the "series" and "which" arguments
of the "plot" method?
3. (this is only for the sake of understanding) the SE are still QMLE
robust following white (1982)?
4. you write
"When using a constant or AR model with DCC based models,standard errors
are calculated for all first stage parameters using a partitioned standard
error matrix. In the case of a VAR model, this joint estimation of standard
errors is not practical due to the dimensionality of the system" So how are
they computed?

Thank you very much for your help!
With my best regards,
Leonardo

Hi Team 

I was also wondering if the slides have been made available yet, I am not yet seeing them on the website.

Thanks

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] RblDataLicense: Connecting R to Bloomberg Data
 License
Message-ID: <CANQ0KOMMobQ2kWR_QKnGpXxQkQ5Q3kr5O-Cz41HKAnKjGDWGhA@mail.gmail.com>

I am thrilled to announce RblDataLicense, a new CRAN package which
connects R to the Bloomberg Data License service, the platform that
delivers Bloomberg?s datasets. Unlike the Rblpapi package for
Bloomberg Terminal users, RblDataLicense does not require the user to
set up any working Bloomberg installation. Built on top of RCurl, the
package establishes sftp connections to the Bloomberg Data License
service.

As a prerequisite, a valid Data License from Bloomberg is needed
together with the corresponding SFTP credentials and whitelisting of
the IP from which accessing the service. This software and its author
are in no way affiliated, endorsed, or approved by "Bloomberg" or any
of its affiliates. "Bloomberg" is a registered trademark.

## These are dummy credentials. Replace with the credentials received
from Bloomberg
RblConnect(user = 'dl000000', pw = '0000000000000000')

## Bloomberg Query
data <- RblQuery(fields = c('PX_LAST', 'PX_OPEN', 'PX_HIGH', 'PX_LOW'),
                             identifiers = c('SXXE Index', "SX5E Index"),
                             from = '2005-01-01')

Source code for the package is at the RblDataLicense GitHub repo where
issue tickets can be filed as well:
