Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] plot.xts/chart_Series, multi.panel and candlesticks
Message-ID: <YTTHzMOzAbKm45nd@local>

I like to plot two candlesticks charts (e.g. two stocks) stacked in
the same plot.

With plot.xts I found some examples
http://joshuaulrich.github.io/xts/plotting_panels.html
https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts/issues/140
for using the multi.panel option but only for one-column-data. Since
candlesticks need four columns of data I wonder how to tell plot.xts
which columns to use for panel 1 and which for panel 2.

Given two stocks
getSymbols('AAPL')
getSymbols('MSFT')

Would I have to merge them into a new xts or pass them to plot.xts
separately?

Mike

You can use the layout() function to split the plot into multiple
sections. There are more examples on the plotting_panels page you
referenced.

layout(matrix(1:2))
chart_Series(AAPL)
chart_Series(MSFT)

Dear AllIn the PerformanceAnalytics package, there is a function that computes annualized Sharpe Ratios. However, the same is not available for computing annualized values of other metrics like Treynor's Ratio, Sortiono Ratio etc.?Can someone please help??Regards,Pankaj K Agarwal

Pankaj,

The annualization of the Sharpe Ratio relies on the (incorrect) square
root of time estimate for scaling the variance of returns. 

The same imprecise scaling estimate is not relevant to the scaling of
different denominators, such as the MAR for the Sortino Ratio, or the
Beta for the Treynor Ratio, or drawdowns for the Calmar Ratio or
Sterling Ratio.  

You could argue that simply calculating anual metrics and taking the
ratios would solve the problem, but then you run into the issue of not
enough annual observations to have any trust in the annuallized numbers
(the standard errors would be very wide, because of the small number of
observations).

It probably makes more sense to calculate all of these ratios over the
period of time that you plan to hold the investment, so that you
understand the likely risk during your expected holding period.  

Regards,

Brian

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Realized GARCH estimation problem
Message-ID: <CA+=sHRaCbcxH=3rb=SdXYGtCQBwExPZD7+eHTFmZ_YHSn5vrRA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to produce one-day ahead volatility forecasts for Bitcoin with
Realized GARCH(1,1) using the rugarch package in R. The realized variance(
data$rv5) is aggregated based on a 5 minute frequency, and the returns(
data.xts$ret) are close-to-close. Here's the specs:

rgarch.spec<- ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder= c(0,0),
                          include.mean = FALSE),
                          variance.model = list(model= 'realGARCH',
                                                garchOrder= c(1,1)),
                          distribution.model = 'norm')

 rgarchroll<- ugarchroll(spec = rgarch.spec,
                         data= data.xts$ret,
                         n.ahead = 1,
                         forecast.length = forecast_len,
                         refit.every = 5,
                         solver= 'hybrid',
                         realizedVol= data.xts$rv5,
                         VaR.alpha = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.10))

realized_vol= sqrt(tail(data.xts$rv5,forecast_len)),
rgarch.prediction_vol= rgarchroll at forecast$density$Sigma)

A plot of the results can be found here: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XAA3r.png

As you can see, the predicted volatility is consistently higher than the
realized volatility. Needless to say, the VaR predictions are not accurate
at all. However, the standard GARCH(1,1) model works fine using the same
return data. So what could possibly be the issue?

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] rmgarch::cgarchfit: how to obtain Q matrix of
 DCC-Copula model?
Message-ID: <CAGyYUSq-LV+QpS665OAHonkc0rokVVdn5XFU8-=pt1Lu9rFVfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm fitting a DCC-Copula model using cgarchfit.
The method rcor provides the conditional correlation matrix R. But how can
I obtain the DCC matrix Q from which R is derived?
I tried rcor(fit, type = "Q") as for dccfit, but this doesn't work for
cgarchfit.
Thanks!
Ezequiel
