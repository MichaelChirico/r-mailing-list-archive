We got both messages. We also a Gentleman's Agreement here to not overdue it

Message-ID: <26322.2924.500202.28527@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


The Rblpapi package is readying a new release with updated libraries. This
would also bring, inter alia, a version for arm64 macOS.

Now, if *you* are familiar with Rblpapi, can build it from source and have
built it from source *we would love to hear from you*.  For "reasons" neither
John nor I can test it right now but as responsible stewards of the code we
would appreciate some testing prior to next steps.

In short, we have a development branch at Rblpapi will builds against a
corresponding development branch at the blp repo providing binary blobs from
Bloomberg (repackaged for our use).  A command such as

   remotes::install_github("Rblp/Rblpapi", ref="feature/release_3.24.6.1")

will do this. Windows users need Rtools, of course. You should then see

   > library(Rblpapi)    
   Rblpapi version 0.3.14.1 using Blpapi headers 3.24.6.1 and run-time 3.24.6.1. 
   Please respect the Bloomberg licensing agreement and terms of service.
   >  

Please come to the GitHub repo for Rblpapi with any questions.

Thanks,  Dirk and John

Hi Dirk

Many thanks and apologies for the double-send here. This 'test' send was
not meant to go out to the full list.

In case it's of interest, if anyone would be interested in offering a
seminar or workshop with Instats <http://instats.org/>, I'd be happy to
chat about this. We collaborate with leading researchers, universities, and
professional associations (including the American Statistical Association,
Statistical Society of Canada, VSSOR, and others) to offer research
training through livestreamed and on-demand workshops to a global audience.

One nice feature of Instats is that we are all academics, so we never seek
to own our partners' IP and we're happy to host free or fee-based content.
We also believe in academic freedom, so you can offer the content you want,
in the format you prefer, and do it on your schedule. After a livestreamed
workshop, we are able to host the content for on-demand access for
streaming across the globe, and we are happy to allow all of your
institution?s students and researchers free access to your content both in
the live and on-demand spaces. This allows you to use Instats as a free
research training platform internally, while generating revenue when
fee-based content sells externally -- if you'd like this option -- and any
profit we generate for ourselves goes to our registered charity.

If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to meet for a quick chat. Instats
also has a new tutorial and demonstration of our platform?s partner
features, which make creating new content a snap with our AI-enabled
seminar builder. Feel free to check out the on-demand streaming video here
<https://instats.org/seminar/run-your-seminars-workshops-and-confer3>.


Best wishes and many thanks

Michael Zyphur

Hi,
?
Are there any plans for

function to handle daily returns aggregated to monthly and year?
?
It would be useful to have a table displaying Monthly Returns and Total 
Return (rows), by year's (columns), for daily returns.

Michael was able to help so we have some progress towards a new release. More

If an alternative package be acceptable as well, then
function 'returns' in PMwR (which I maintain) might do
what you want:

    returns(<series>, period = "month")

in which series is a zoo (or xts) series.  It is
described in the manual:
https://enricoschumann.net/R/packages/PMwR/manual/PMwR.html#holding-period-returns

the 'returns' package has just turned them into whole numbers rather
than decimals. ?The numbers all agree.

Thank you, Brian.  Indeed, I do hope that the numbers
are the same ;-)

Amarjit, it's just that PMwR::returns _prints_ the
returns as percentages.  To give an example:

    library("quantmod")
    S <- getSymbols("SPY", src = "yahoo",
                    from = as.Date("2020-01-01"),
                    return.class = "zoo",
                    periodicity = "daily", 
                    auto.assign = FALSE)[, 6]
    
    library("PMwR")
    returns(S, period = "month")
    ##       Jan  Feb   Mar  Apr May  Jun Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec   YTD
    ## 2020 -1.0 -7.9 -12.5 12.7 4.8  1.8 5.9  7.0 -3.7 -2.5 10.9  3.7  17.2
    ## 2021 -1.0  2.8   4.5  5.3 0.7  2.2 2.4  3.0 -4.7  7.0 -0.8  4.6  28.7
    ## 2022 -5.3 -3.0   3.8 -8.8 0.2 -8.2 9.2 -4.1 -9.2  8.1  5.6 -5.8 -18.2
    ## 2023  6.3 -2.5   3.7  1.6 0.5  6.5 3.3 -1.6 -4.7 -2.2  9.1  4.6  26.2
    ## 2024  1.6  5.2   3.3 -4.0 5.1  3.5 1.2  2.3 -2.3                 16.6

To see the raw numbers, a convenient way is to use
'as.matrix', which drops the class and leaves a numeric
matrix (with options(digits = 3)):

    as.matrix(returns(S, period = "month"))

Hi,
I'm having a problem in reproducing the following example reproduced below,
which is provided in the documentation with rugarch = 1.5.2 and rmgarch =
1.3.9.
Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated!
Thank you for your assistance.
Best regards,

data(dji30ret)
spec = gogarchspec(mean.model = list(demean = "constant"),
variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH", garchOrder = c(1,1), submodel =
NULL),
distribution.model = list(distribution = "manig"),ica = "fastica")
fit = gogarchfit(spec = spec, data = dji30ret[,1:4, drop = FALSE],
out.sample = 50, gfun = "tanh")

which returns the following error:

Error in .local(variance.model, mean.model, distribution.model, start.pars, :

Just use distribution.model = ?manig?? the example should probably be updated to reflect this.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Rblpapi release candidate
Message-ID: <26338.14123.88859.992324@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


Another follow-up to the thread from last week: we made good progress and now
have a new release candidate version 0.3.14.1 of package Rblpapi in source
form at the GitHub repo [1] and also as binaries at the r-universe page [2].

Binary builds for windows and macos/arm64 are available, you can install
these directly via

   repos <- c('https://rblp.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
   install.packages('Rblpapi', repos = repos)

which will also install any dependencies. (There is also a Linux binary you
can use on Ubuntu 24.04 along with r2u binaries, see [3] and [4].)

We would appreciate additional testing 'just in case'. All features of the
prior release 0.3.14 are supported, but are now provided via the current SDK
for the Bloomberg API.

Cheers,  Dirk

Anyone who was actually an active part of the R-SIG Finance mailing list
would know that the Tidyverse is uniquely given the side-eye around these
parts for overriding several critical functions.

Boooooooooo.

(indeed!)

It is absolutely fully  INappropriate that  Michael Zyphur  (Head of 'Instats')
sends such advertizements to *several*  R-SIG-*
R Special Interest Groups' mailing lists,  which are
*NOT AT ALL* related to tidyverse and general R & Stats courses,
indeed !

I hope this will be the last time this has happened!
       (and yes, I'm sometimes too optimistic ;-)
