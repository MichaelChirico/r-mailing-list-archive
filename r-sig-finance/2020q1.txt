R/Finance 2020: Applied Finance with R
June 5 and 6, 2020
University of Illinois at Chicago

Call for Presentations

The twelfth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R
will be held on June 5 and 6, 2020 in Chicago, IL, USA at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. The conference will cover topics
including portfolio management, time series analysis, advanced risk
tools, high-performance computing, market microstructure, and
econometrics. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a
primary tool for financial model development, risk management,
portfolio construction, and trading.

>From its humble Midwest beginnings, word of the conference spread
among trading desks and universities, until it became the primary
meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in
quantitative finance. The conference has featured presentations from
prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another
exciting line-up for 2020.

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format for
consideration. We will also consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf
format) although more complete papers are preferred. We welcome
submissions for full talks (approximately 20 min.), abbreviated
?lightning talks? (approximately 6 min.), and (1 hour) pre-conference
tutorials. (Scheduling considerations may require requested full talks
moved to lightning). Both academic and practitioner proposals related
to R are encouraged.

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time.
Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to
accompany the slides. Ideally, data sets should be made public for the
purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due
to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to innovative
research or presenters who have released R packages.

Please submit proposals online
http://go.uic.edu/rfinance2020CFP

Limited financial assistance for travel and conference admission may
be available to presenters. As R/Finance is a volunteer open source
effort from which organizers do not profit, resources are derived from
registrations and sponsorship alone. Requests for financial assistance
must be made at the time of submission, and the presenter should
clearly communicate to us why assistance is being requested. We
particularly welcome requests from under- represented minorities in
Quantitative Finance/STEM, and anyone researching under economic
hardship.

Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a
final submission deadline of February 1, 2020. Submitters will be
notified via email starting February 15, 2020 of acceptance and
presentation length.

Additional details will be announced via the conference website
http://www.RinFinance.com/ as they become available. Information on
previous years? presenters and their presentations are also at the
conference website. We will make a separate announcement when
registration opens, in late March.

For the conference committee:

Petra Bakosova, Gib Bassett, Peter Carl, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Soumya
Kalra, Dan McMillen, Brian Peterson, Dale Rosenthal, Jeffrey Ryan,
Justin Shea, Joshua Ulrich

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Multivariate random number generation for skewed
 distribution of asset class returns
References: <827719630.9574942.1579012296690.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <827719630.9574942.1579012296690@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi R-SIG-Finance mailing list,
I have a query about performing a Monte Carlo random number generation for asset class returns which accounts for the distribution of the asset class (mean, variance, skewness and possibly kurtosis) while also taking into consideration the correlation/covariance matrix of the asset classes.?
I came across the R package, mvtnorm, which is able to take the asset classes' means, covariance matrix for a normal distribution, through the function?rmvnorm(n, mean = muvec, sigma = covmat), where n is number of trials, mean is the mean vector and sigma is the covariance matrix. However, this package does not allow for a skewed distribution or excess kurtosis. Historical data for my asset class returns show both positive and negative skewness. Additionally, the Johnson distribution function in R package, SuppDists, does not seem to account for covariances as inputs.
Hence, is there an R package/function that allows me to perform the random number generation for multivariate returns, which accounts for mean, variance, correlation, skewness and even kurtosis as inputs under the Monte Carlo simulation?
Thank you
Best regards,
Sjedi

This is a question I was actually asked by the head of AI/ML for a fairly
large company and I'll give the same answer here:

Perform the bootstrapping of your choice. That is, take the empirical
returns, and just sample from them. If you want to preserve
autocorrelations, take chunks of time instead of one observation. If you
want to add some random noise, feel free to create some noise distributions
as well.

Hope this helps.

Ilya suggests to "take chunks of time instead of one observation". In the
academic literature this method is referred to as the "block bootstrap".
See, for example, "Bootstraps for Time Series" by Peter Buhlmann, which
discusses model-based bootstraps, sieve bootstraps and block bootstraps.
You might also Google these terms to look for other sources of information.

HTH,
Eric

Message-ID: <385494d8-6743-ca19-3c00-e947fa2cb768@organicfoodmarkets.com.au>

Hi

I am studying the spread between a couple of interest rate futures on 
the ASX using R and IB

The futures are IR and IT.

This data line is produced by a callback looping on them at 4:30 pm when 
trade finishes:

time ->? 2020-01-21 16:29:59.818593 last IR -> 99.19 last YT -> 99.26 
spread ->? -0.0700000000000074

This data is produced by a call to reqHistoricalData for close yesterday 
(21 Jan)

 ?????????????????????????????????? last IR ->? 99.2 last YT ->? 99.29 
spread ->? -0.01993848

I know they are 'similar' but is it normal for them to differ?

They are different symbols with  different tenors, so yes, it is normal
for them to differ.

iirc, IR is a 90-day interbank rate, and YT is a 3-yr bond  

It's been a while, so I might have those tenors wrong, but either way
they are futures for different rates.  Why would you expect them to be
the same?

Message-ID: <CAAK5yy7KsnF90kmvUHNP-r-VaJCN0rjWMBbDU5O8ehpaYss9Dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Ive been building a testing an intraday strategy in quantstrat Ive got most
of the logic up and running fine but Im running into a road block with two
issues, which I haven't found any documentation to help me anywhere in the
forum histories.

1. Because its an intraday system, I want to limit the total number of
trades the system attempts to execute on any given day. How would I best
approach this?

2. I would like to introduce dynamic position sizing where the size of the
position is determinedly the distance between the entry level and the stop
level and targets risking a fixed percentage of the account equity. Again,
Im at a loss as to where to start with this.

If anyone is able to give me some pointers I'd be extremely grateful.

Many thanks.
Roj.

1) Take a look at the actual code for some of the signals such as
sigCrossover, then implement another signal function that takes the running
sum of your signals. Granted, if some of those signals are limit orders
that don't fire off, this isn't perfect.

2) Take a look at my osDollarATR function.

Greetings


My name is Camila Villegas, I  write to you about a fault that I found in
the rugarch package and that I would like to discuss with you.

For my master's research, I conducted simulations with the rugarch package
to evaluate its operation with a TGARCH model (1,1).

First I analyzed the convergence of the estimated parameters and they
presented no problems. plus the mean square error decreased as the sample
size increased.

The validation of the modeling results (obtained by the "ugarchfit"
function) I carried out by analyzing the residues generated by the
"residuals" function. The simulated residues originally had zero mean and
variance one, however, in the 10,000 simulations that I developed, the
values of the variances of the residues generated by the "ugarchfit"
function were significantly different from one.

On the contrary, when calculating the residues "manually" and only using
the parameters estimated by the package, we obtained means close to zero
and variances close to one.

With this last point, I observed a flaw in the residues delivered by the
rugarch package for a TGARCH process (1,1), since they do not have the same
variance with which they were simulated.

Thanking your observations,

Kind Regards.

Camila Villegas Orellana

Hi Camila,

Can you provide some reproducible code to help us investigate and debug this issue. It is hard to do so from the description provided.

Thanks,

Alexios

I am looking for new Maintainers for the Rmetrics packages suite.

The following packages have top priority:
timeDate, timeSeries, fBasics, fGarch

Further I would be very happy to find new maintainers for the following packages:
fImport
fMultivar, fRegression, fNonlinear, fUnitRoots
fArma, fCopulae, fExtremes
fBonds, fOptions, fAsianOptions, fExoticOptions
fAssets, fPortfolio, fTrading

If you are interested in becoming the new maintainer of one of these packages I would be very happy to hear from you.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Asymmetric Vector MEM using rmgarch
Message-ID: <1581397473.29351.43.camel@hdr.mq.edu.au>

Hi,

Is it possible to run an asymmetric vector MEM using the rmgarch package??  And if so, could someone please point me towards the R code that could achieve that?

The general model that I am trying to code in R can be found in this paper here https://www.nber.org/papers/w12690.pdf  The reason I am wanting to use the asymmetric vMEM is because the high frequency data that I have contains calls and puts among other things that I wish to model.

The resource here https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/209789/estimate-the-paramters-of-the-simplest-multiplicative-error-model shows how to code a standard MEM, however, I don't quite understand what the code is doing compared to the formulas in the paper that were referenced.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
~Evan

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] rugarch singular issue
Message-ID: <8B68322A-1639-4CB0-8A6C-6A34805EB587@coventry.ac.uk>

Hi Alexios,

I am working on ?rugarch? package recently and sometimes have
Error in robustvcv(fun = f, pars = ipars[estidx, 1], nlag = nlag, hess = fit$hessian, : object 'B' not found

Error in solve.default(A) :
  system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 1.91379e-16

which is related to the file
rugarch-numderiv.R line 140

robustvcv = function(fun, pars, nlag = 0, hess, n, ...)

...

        Ainv = try( solve(A), silent = TRUE )

Because 'solve(A)? think the matrix A is singular. Instead of using solve(A), using inv(A) available in the package ?matlib? will solve the issue.

Do you think this is a reasonable change in the package?

Best regards
Jia Shao

Hi Jia,

Not sure that the use of "inv" is the right solution since A IS probably 
singular or close to such. This means that something went wrong in the
optimization. Would you mind sharing a reproducible example? I can try
and investigate a little more.

Thanks,

Alexios

Dear R-Finance,
I just try to do portfolio analysis by using Rmetrics-fPortfolio. But, 
on some timeseries, there is error at below.
Below, it's my R code(Attached is the timeseries data)
Ret_ts <- as.timeSeries(RollingData)
EffFrontier <- portfolioFrontier(Ret_ts, constraints ="LongOnly")
Error in `colnames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = names(getMu(Data))) :
attempt to set 'colnames' on an object with less than two dimensions
>From my observation, it's related with timeseries data because most of 
timeseries periods works well.
Only some periods will force be stop and get this error message. Google 
above error message.
It has been raised in several years ago. Someone thought it might come 
from "*setNFrontierPoints".* I tried this way and it can't work.
I adjusted others parameters, constraints. It still is the same error. 
Unfortunately, I didn't get solution by self and don't know how to debug.
Now, I raise this problem again. wish this issue could be here again and 
someone can figure out.
Thanks for R-community.

But I'm new in R, and I don't know how to fit the model.

My model is

Garch(1)


in eviews is:

Garch(1)

I don't understand how to fit this model in R
Please, you could help me? I'm very grateful whit you.

These are the first few R examples.?? The rest of the vignette, some 
differ, so are same, some differ on rounding.?? The data files are the

I was planning?? awhile back to create a beamer presentation from this

Do you want me to updated the expected values in the in the vignettes?

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Portfolio Composition Forecasting
Message-ID: <CALGfFMYGMnKfz4rJMsVOLm6HmbNcn72O+Kie32HbELYKoVAkQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction.

Is there an R-package (or other software) that can be used to forecast the
next period's portfolio composition?  There are many portfolio optimization
packages, but this is not the same question.  Say I take the past* x*
periods, each period holds the percentage composition of an investment
portfolio (sums to 1); the composition of assets will contain key assets
held (or increased/decreased) through periods, but new assets will be added
to the portfolio over time, while some holdings will be dropped, so we will
have nuisance here.  I would like to model the past* x* periods, accept
this mentioned error, and forecast or simulate for* x+1* period.

Does anyone have any experience with this, or have any pointers within the
broader domain of statistics?

Many thanks in advance,
Gareth

Itr seems to me tomorrows portfolio is the same as today's portfolio
except for organic change in weights caused by market price
fluctuations, or by a rebalancing event.  The 'forecast' is the
standard naive forecast: today's portfolio will still be held tomorrow,
unless you rebalance.

I don't see any value in a simulation from the prior holdings. 
Portfolios are rebalanced for some business reason, and those reasons
are usually pretty well understood, and not the result of a random draw
from some distribution of prior holdings.

What am I missing?

Regards,

Brian

Hi Brian, All

Forecasting or a way to simulate next period's weights, based on a series
of past period's weights, is more accurate of what I'd like to do. I
realize the tough ask, but curious if there is a package that could be used
for this.

Any directions, in the world of R packages or statistical methods would be
very much appreciated.

Thanks
Gareth

I have a very similar view to Brian.  I also think of weights as something
that is a deterministic function of the actual prices that have been
realized.  So if one forecasts tomorrows prices, forecasting tomorrows
weights would follow.  What am I missing ?

Suppose an actively-managed fund is benchmarked to the S&P 500. I would expect that
the weights of stocks gradually converge to the market cap weights. So you could?
simulate deviations of individual weights from a benchmark as following an AR(1) process
with an AR(1) coefficient being slightly less than 1. For a multivariate model of all stock
weight deviations, you could simulate from a VAR(1) model where the matrix of autoregressive
coefficients is diagonal. This model does ignore the fact that many portfolios have exactly
zero weights in many stocks and do not short stocks. It predicts that managers trade small
amounts of all stocks every day, but in reality, active discretionary managers make large
trades in a few stocks. If managers tend to trade in the same direction over several days,?
a higher-order VAR model could be used. As others said, the model really depends on
the investment process used.

Hi all,

R/Finance 2020 is less than 3 months away (June 5-6) and it's
impossible to predict how the global COVID-19 pandemic will continue
to unfold. As you can imagine, this uncertainty makes it extremely
difficult to plan an international conference with dozens of speakers
and hundreds of attendees.

We hope COVID-19 is no longer a global threat in June, but we don't
know the extent that international travel and large gatherings will
still be discouraged. Due to that uncertainty, we have decided to
cancel this year's R/Finance Conference. This was a difficult
decision, but the safety of our attendees comes first.

We truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for you. And
we would like to invite you to submit a proposal to next year?s
conference. The date is yet to be determined, but will likely be in
early June.

For the committee,
Petra Bakosova, Gib Bassett, Peter Carl, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Soumya
Kalra, Dan McMillen, Brian Peterson, Dale Rosenthal, Jeffrey Ryan,
Justin Shea, Joshua Ulrich

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Fisher Transformation quantstrat strategy
Message-ID: <CAFN2O_umng7h1=D_iQ73WYaG1Hd5SntL6TxN8p3MtZ2BqOfeuw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a doubt/question regarding quantstrat (appologies if the mailing
list is not for this purpose).

I thought in order to better understand the quantstrat package that I would
try an implement a known trading strategy. Found here (
https://www.mesasoftware.com/papers/TheInverseFisherTransform.pdf )

The strategy is the following:

-          #1a) Buy when the indicator crosses over -0.5 or

-          #1b) Buy when the indicator crosses over +0.5 if it has not
previously crossed over -0.5

-          #2a) Sell short when the indicator crosses under +0.5 or

-          #2b) Sell short when the indicator crosses under -0.5 if it has
not previously crossed under +0.5

I ?believe? I have parts 1a and 2a (correct me if I am wrong). However, I
am finding it a little difficult to implement parts 1b and 2b.

My question is, how can I implement the indicator when it crosses +0.5 but
has not previously crossed over -0.5. I can create the indicator to cross
+0.5 but not sure how to implement the ?not previously crossed -0.5? part,
I have made some comments throughout the code where I have my doubts.
