Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Confidence Intervals for Visual Testing - free
 seminars
Message-ID: <CAFEsyOxEtaeti5Sb_pmDYvhY9FGN0jXOY=iedXp9LDDGd84wZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

Instats is pleased to be offering free seminars on Using Confidence
Intervals for Visual Testing for R (Oct 25) and Stata (Nov 1), with
professor David Armstrong from the University of Western Ontario:

https://instats.org/seminar/using-confidence-intervals-for-visual-testing-in-r-2248

https://instats.org/seminar/using-confidence-intervals-for-visual-testing-in-s-2166

Confidence intervals and visualizations of them are common in the
presentation of statistical results. Since their invention in the 1930's,
researchers have recognized that readers will try to make inferences
comparing estimates by evaluating whether confidence intervals overlap. A
long line of research has discussed the pitfalls of this and attempted to
build inferences around the probability that confidence intervals overlap
under the null hypothesis - essentially burdening the visual display with
an additional hypothesis testing function. To improve on this, these
seminars will explore new visual tools that allow researchers to understand
the precision of their estimates and to visually compare different groups
or conditions in a meaningful and statistically defensible way. Designed
for researchers across many disciplines, this workshop will equip
participants with the expertise needed to leverage confidence intervals
effectively using R and Stata.

Instats is also offering free seminars on Switching from SPSS to R
<https://instats.org/seminar/switching-from-spss-to-r-free-2-hour-se2> (Nov
5) and Efficient Programming in R
<https://instats.org/seminar/efficient-programming-using-r-free-semi2> (Jan
27). We look forward to seeing you there!

Hi everyone

Apologies for posting fee-based events here previously. We have some free
events that may be of interest to you and I wanted to offer them to the
list -- and henceforth I'll limit posting about such free events to once
per month at most:

Instats is offering a free 3-hour seminar on Efficient Programming in R
<https://instats.org/seminar/efficient-programming-using-r-free-semi2?utm_source=MEDICAL-PHYSICS-ENGINEERING>,
running Jan 27 with professor Michail Tsagris. This free seminar explores
efficient programming techniques in R for advanced data analysis, focusing
on optimizing code, enhancing computational speed, and ensuring
reproducible research practices. Participants will gain practical skills
beneficial for diverse fields, improving both the precision and impact of
their analytical work. Geared towards PhD students, academics, and
professional researchers, the workshop will illuminate the nuances of
proficient R programming that directly contributes to more robust and
reproducible research outcomes.

Instats is also offering a free seminar on Operations, Finance, and Stock
Market Performance
<https://instats.org/seminar/operations-finance-and-stock-market-performance-2444>,
running Dec 3 with the co-director of the Supply Chain Analytics Laboratory
at Rutgers University, professor Yao Zhao. This seminar explores the
interplay between operations, finance, and stock market performance.
Participants will gain quantitative insights into how operational decisions
impact financial outcomes and subsequently stock market movements,
utilizing vast and free business and financial databases like SCDATA.AI for
sophisticated data analysis and predictive analytics, and using recent
examples like Amazon, Intel, Boeing and Tesla.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Call for Presentations: Open Source Quantitative
 Finance (formerly R/Finance)
Message-ID: <CAPPM_gTwBV4XXYWRkW-QAVgmoMuYsSq9j-vR27F4QovWJoeNrA@mail.gmail.com>

Open Source Quantitative Finance 2025
April 11 and 12, 2025
University of Illinois at Chicago

Call for Presentations

The seventeenth annual Open Source Quantitative Finance (osQF,
formerly R/Finance) conference for applied finance using open source
programming languages and free software systems for statistical
computation and graphics, will be held on Friday & Saturday, April
11th-12th, 2025 at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Once again, we?ve partnered with the Chicago R User Group and PyData
Chicago to kickoff the conference on the evening of Thursday, April
10th. A series of relevant talks on quantitative finance will be
presented, followed by an opportunity to sample Chicago?s vibrant
nightlife.

The two day conference will cover topics including advanced risk
tools, decentralized finance, econometrics, high-performance
computing, market microstructure, portfolio management, and time
series analysis. All will be discussed within the context of using
open source programming languages as primary tools for financial model
development, portfolio construction, risk management, and trading.

>From its humble Midwest beginnings, word of the conference spread
among trading desks and universities, until it became the primary
meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using open
source quantitative finance.

Over the past seventeen years, the conference formerly known as
R/Finance has included work contributed in many open source
programming languages. This year, we?ve formally changed the name to
reflect our commitment to the broader open source programming language
community in quantitative finance. As always, we expect to welcome
attendees from around the world, host presentations from prominent
academics and practitioners. We look forward to another exciting
lineup for 2025!

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format for
consideration. We will also consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf
format) although more complete papers are preferred. We welcome
submissions for full talks (approximately 20 min.), abbreviated
"lightning talks" (approx. 6 min.), as well as (1 hr.) pre-conference
tutorials. (Scheduling considerations may require requested full talks
moved to lightning). Both academic and practitioner proposals related
to R and other Open Source programming languages are encouraged.

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time.
Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working code to
accompany the slides. Ideally, data sets should be made public for the
purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due
to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to innovative
research or presenters who have released open source packages or
software.

Limited financial assistance for conference admission may be available
to presenters. As osQF is a volunteer open source effort from which
organizers do not profit, resources are derived from registrations and
sponsorship alone. Requests for financial assistance must be made at
the time of submission, and the presenter should clearly communicate
to us why assistance is being requested. We particularly welcome
requests from underrepresented minorities in Quantitative
Finance/STEM, and anyone researching under economic hardship.

Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a
final submission deadline of January 19, 2025.  Submitters will be
notified via email starting January 26, 2025 of acceptance and
presentation length.

Additional details will be announced via the conference website
http://www.RinFinance.com/ as they become available. Information on
previous years' presenters and their presentations are also at the
conference website. We will make a separate announcement when
registration opens, in January.

For the conference committee:

Petra Bakosova, Kyle Balkissoon, Gib Bassett, Oleg Bondarenko, Peter
Carl, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Soumya Kalra, Brian Peterson, Dale Rosenthal,
Jeffrey Ryan, Justin Shea, and Joshua Ulrich.

Message-ID: <CAOTSzf=9qhBxMMYQWYQD-LbDDkeEJ+Bpj348j4+DQgVC+J4gdA@mail.gmail.com>

I (and my students) used to download historical prices from yahoo finance
with the Quantmod function getSymbols(). It seems that it now requires
yahoo premium service. Is there a way around? If not, are there other free
sources for downloading prices?
Thank you, Alec

Can you show an actual request that fails?  I have multiple recurrent jobs
using Yahoo!, and I do not have any premium service.

I had to delete the screenshot as my message below violates the size
constraint imposed by r-sig-finance. It can be seen on the yahoo finance

I just tried a basic getSymbols('SPY', from = '1990-01-01'), and it went
off without a hitch.

Yep. And we are not fan of screen shots either.

You can't do the assignment unless you set the option I showed in my initial email.

So we need to debug this.

For kicks, I just installed quantmod and its five depedencies on a fresh r2u
container running Ubuntu 24.04.  No options, no nothing:

Well for that you may have to talk to Yahoo! rather than this list.

It was _years_ ago that exchanges started to derive more than half their
total revenue from data sales. That we still get this data this is a small
miracle, and in large part due to some folks tirelessly toiling away to
update the code. It is appreciated.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Quantstrat: Multiple instruments,
 pre-generated signals
Message-ID: <Z2NPI_lFh4t_o3Qk@local>

My strategy involves a universe with more than 1000 stocks. Since
the entry rules are complex, I've generated the entry signals with
a separate program. The resulting table for entry signals includes
these columns: Symbol, EntryDate, EntryTime, ExitDate.

The backtest has to run on intraday basis. I have intraday data
OHLCV for every stock involved.  The period to be tested spans
several years.

Each trade has to be closed market on close on ExitDate at the
latest (time stop).

Stop loss and take profit have to be handled prior to close on
ExitDate. Stop loss has to be tightened up once if a profit target
is met.

Can I backtest such a type of strategy using quantstrat?
Especially:
- Can I inject pre-generated signals to quantstrat?
- Can quantstrat/R handle such an amount of data?

Mike

Mike,

Yes, you definitely can. You can definitely inject pre-generated signals as
additional columns on your data ahead of time, and then use add.signal to
work with them later, skipping the add.indicator step entirely.
Quantstrat/R *can* handle such an amount of data, but understand that
quantstrat will loop over each instrument individually, and the loops occur
by signal observations.

That said, the "handle these prior to close" is a bit *vague* as far as
objective implementation goes. What does "prior to close" mean? 3:55 PM EST?

The rest of the logic seems implementable through various order chains.

Hope this helps.

Best,

Ilya

So if the strategy involves 1000 stocks quantstrat's object would
get 1000 additional columns?

Does this mean, when there are multiple entry signals at the same
day and time and I like to discard some of them (because of
insufficient cash) that I can not do this on a random basis? The idea
would be to add a Monte Carlo simulation at such points, but I'm not
sure how long such a calculation would take.

What do you mean by this?

I just referred to the time stop rule one paragraph above. The exit
should be like a three-leg logical or-rule:

My trades start at EntryDate, EntryTime and exit (at the latest)
with the close of the last bar of ExitDate. But a trade is closed out
earlier, if a take profit or a stop loss is met.

So if at any day during the trade's lifetime a bar at 3:55 PM EST
(or whenever) mets a take profit or a stop loss, the trade should be
closed - even if the last bar of ExitDate is not yet reached.

Thanks
Mike

No. Each stock is passed in as its own object in initialization. And each
stock would need its own separate additional column.

Quantstrat processes instruments one at a time. It is not aware of
positions in other instruments. There are ways to get at the order book and
extract signals/positions to potentially do further calculations later, but
that would be outside of the scope of the quantstrat simulation.

>  What do you mean by this?

If you have 1,000 instruments, each with 10 signals, quantstrat would need
10,000 steps in that loop to run the simulation.

Order chaining (one cancels the other) can take care of that. See this post
I made a long time ago:

A Hammer Trading System ? Demonstrating Custom Indicator-Based Limit Orders
in Quantstrat | QuantStrat TradeR
<https://quantstrattrader.com/2014/08/18/a-hammer-trading-system-demonstrating-custom-indicator-based-limit-orders-in-quantstrat/>

While that basically uses a custom R package that I haven't updated in
years, the idea is that you can add your basic entry and exit rules (though
I'm not quite sure how a time-to-exit rule would work with intraday data--I
suppose it could be something like the max time before 4:00 PM EST on the
date of exit), and then you can create chain orders based off of your basic
exit rule to override it with a take profit or stop loss.
