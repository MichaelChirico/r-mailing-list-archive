 Hi,
I am using the following to simulate a multivariate GARCH model:

cgarchsim(model, n.sim = samples, n.start = 0, m.sim = simCount,
startMethod = "unconditional", only.density = TRUE)

But I seem to have an issue where the early draws from the simulation have
variances across multiple simulations that are different from the
unconditional variance, but meet the unconditional over time. As I
understand it, I can use the start parameter to burn-in draws, but I was
curious as to why the startMethod isn't sufficient.

Thanks,
Simon

 X axis labels, title, subtitle, labels customisation
Message-ID: <CAPZA_qLf4_iFoPXigAhwF6wBOryEwt=zp4UoEQbR0SF_OC5Org@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'd like to customize the makeChart function output of the quantmod
library.  Its main objective is threefold:

1. have x axis labels at 45 degree angle.
2. have a title and subtitle
3. have labels legends.

I can obtain the desired output via the ggplot code below.  However, the
chartSeries() function doesn't work. port_cumulative_ret along with the
other data required are obtained via tiidyquant library.

port_cumulative_ret %>%
    ## axis data
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cum_ret)) +
    ## plot configuration
    theme_gray() +
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray86")) +
    geom_line(color = "blue") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1)) +  ## x axis
text at 45 degree angle
    ## graph text, notation and number settings
    labs(x = 'Data',
            y = 'Cum Return',
         title = paste0('Portfolio Cum Return on ', format(as.Date(end),
format="%m/%d/%Y")),
         subtitle = paste0("Actives: ", toString(tickers.clean),
"\nWeights: ",
                           toString(percent(wts, accuracy = 0.01)))
         ) +
    ## axis numbering settings
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = '2 weeks',
                 date_labels = '%d %b %y')
    )

Thanks in advance for any help.

Hi Andre ,

If you must stay in quantmod, you can add some cosmetic tweaks manually:

library(quantmod)

chartSeries(portf_xts,
            theme = chartTheme("white"),
            name = "Portfolio Cumulative Return",
            TA = NULL) # remove technical analysis overlays for clean chart

# Add a subtitle manually
mtext("Actives: AAPL, MSFT | Weights: 50%, 50%", side = 3, line = 0.5, cex
= 0.8)

# Rotate x-axis labels manually
axis(1, at = axTicks(1), labels = FALSE)
text(x = axTicks(1),
     y = par("usr")[3] - 0.05,
     srt = 45, adj = 1,
     labels = format(index(portf_xts)[axTicks(1)], "%d %b %y"),
     xpd = TRUE, cex = 0.7)

This works but is clunky ? you?re manually redrawing parts of the chart.

Hello,

Is there a way to have a custom background color on a chart plot?
I was able to obtain its outer range with gray color via bg.col = "gray"
however I rather have this color throughout the chart. TIA.

I'm wondering what's the adequate volatility estimate from the rugarch
output for a ARMA-GARCH model:
1) std(ARMA-GARCH residuals)
2) GARCH sigma

Thank you! Alec

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Custom colour on the plot background using
 chartSeries()
Message-ID: <CAPZA_q+U5ObHY-2GyHKNAjbHOJYPRvX6r0QRxkHN1NeskuHOfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to get a custom colour on a plot background to no avail.
I also tried via custom theme and via the rect function described below.

myTheme <- chart_theme()
myTheme$col$bg <- "#6C7B8B"   ## "slategray4" or
myTheme$panel.background$fill <- "slategray4"

## Via set plot region color
rect(
    par("usr")[1],
    par("usr")[3],
    par("usr")[2],
    par("usr")[4],
    col = "slategray4"
)

The solution below keeps the actual plot with white background for only its
borders have the desired colour,

 chartSeries(PETR4.SA,
                          theme = chartTheme('white', up.col = 'darkgreen',
bg.col = "darkgray"),
                          par(lwd = 2),
                          type = "line",
                          bar.type = "hlc",
                          major.ticks='months',
                          minor.ticks=TRUE,
                          show.grid = TRUE,
                          TA = NULL
                          ) + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill =
"darkgray", color = "darkgray", size = 2))

Suggestions?  Any help greatly appreciated.

Best,
