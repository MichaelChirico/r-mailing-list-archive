Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] from a list of array to tibble
Message-ID: <CAK1hC9u_EdTjfEgO6KZrYxt-xW+q-uq83VRGomD-Efqx=kc8gA@mail.gmail.com>

I work with a list of crypto assets daily closing prices in xts class. Here
is a limited example:

asset.xts.lst <- list(BTCUSDT = structure(c(26759.63, 26862, 26852.48,
27154.15,
27973.45), dim = c(5L, 1L), index = structure(c(1697068800, 1697155200,
1697241600, 1697328000, 1697414400), tzone = "UTC", tclass = "Date"), class
= c("xts",
"zoo")), ETHUSDT = structure(c(1539.61, 1552.16, 1554.94, 1557.77,
1579.73), dim = c(5L, 1L), index = structure(c(1697068800, 1697155200,
1697241600, 1697328000, 1697414400), tzone = "UTC", tclass = "Date"), class
= c("xts",
"zoo")), TRXUSDT = structure(c(0.08481, 0.08549, 0.08501, 0.08667,
0.08821), dim = c(5L, 1L), index = structure(c(1697068800, 1697155200,
1697241600, 1697328000, 1697414400), tzone = "UTC", tclass = "Date"), class
= c("xts",
"zoo")))

I will compute some function from PerformanceAnalytics package and write
all results in a tibble. Let's apply a first function, Return.annualized()
(at first I computed returns from daily prices). I have now a list of
arrays named my.ret.lst:

my.ret.lst <- list(BTCUSDT = structure(15.36, dim = c(1L, 1L), dimnames =
list(
    "Annualized Return", NULL)), ETHUSDT = structure(4.06, dim = c(1L,
1L), dimnames = list("Annualized Return", NULL)), TRXUSDT = structure(10.9,
dim = c(1L,
1L), dimnames = list("Annualized Return", NULL)))

Now I can't find a way to start my tibble. The idea is to have variables
BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT and TRXUSDT (token names), with observations (like
annualized return) and the respective values. I will add of course many
other observations.My row names can be either my token names, or the
observation (annualized return).
In my example, I can't find a way to pass each list element name to the
wanted tibble.

Thank you for help

Do you mean something like this?

    data.frame(my.ret.lst)
    ##                   BTCUSDT ETHUSDT TRXUSDT
    ## Annualized Return   15.36    4.06    10.9

(I don't use tibbles, but there is probably an 'as.tibble' method or
 similar.)

Perhaps you should have used 'The trouble with tibbles" as your subject

In fact, I realized this is not recommended to give names to rows. A
better approach is to add a column with all names as row. The
following does the job:

asset.stats <- as_tibble_col(unlist(my.ret.lst), column_name =
'Annualized_return')
asset.stats <- rownames_to_column(asset.stats, var = 'Assets')
asset.stats$Assets <- names(my.ret.lst)

this is the idea, but BTCUSDT etc as rows and Annualized_Return as one
column name.

I have a xts object with assets daily closing prices. I would like to

PerformanceAnalytics::table.correlation() function let me with a very
ugly output.
Is there any other function from a package which will print a user

See the package corrplot - you get very nice visual plots of correlations and also printouts of all pairwise correlations. You may need to use coredata() to extract data as a matrix to be passed to the function corrplot().

Very cool package! No need to use coredata(). This works:

data(edhec, package = "PerformanceAnalytics")
corrplot::corrplot(cor(edhec))

Well, that's it not so bad, but I honestly prefer the  solution from
package corrplot

That *is* a solution using the corrplot() function from the corrplot
package. I only used the edhec data from PerformanceAnalytics, and
only for convenience because I knew you had that package installed.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] R/Finance 2024: Call for Presentations
Message-ID: <CAPPM_gQ_6LXr+yQrCU-2fHqfBsSZmbWmn0LEaCAVtDBxO_Ts3g@mail.gmail.com>

R/Finance 2024: Applied Finance with R
May 17 and 18, 2024
University of Illinois at Chicago

Call for Presentations

The sixteenth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R
will be held on May 17th and 18th, 2024 in Chicago, IL, at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. The conference will cover topics
including advanced risk tools, decentralized finance, econometrics,
high-performance computing, market microstructure, portfolio
management, time series analysis, and more. All will be discussed
within the context of using R and related programming languages as
primary tools for data pipelines, financial model development,
portfolio construction, risk management, and trading.

>From its humble Midwest beginnings, word of the conference spread
among trading desks and universities, until it became the primary
meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in
quantitative finance. The conference has featured presentations from
prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another
exciting line-up for 2024.

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format, or one-page
abstracts (in txt or pdf format). More complete papers are preferred,
as well as submissions that include working code. We welcome
submissions for full talks (approximately 20 min.), abbreviated
?lightning talks? (approx. 6 min.), as well as (1 hr.) pre-conference
tutorials. (Scheduling considerations may require requested full talks
moved to lightning).

Both academic and practitioner proposals related to R are encouraged.
We especially encourage those who were previously unaware of R/Finance
to submit their talk proposals. There are many benefits to giving a
presentation at the conference. It makes your work visible to the
community, which often leads to interesting conversations with others
about your work. A full paper is not required!

In an effort to increase diversity of the presentations and presenters
at the conference, the committee asks and encourages members of
under-represented or historically marginalized groups to respond to
the Call for Presentations. See the Diversity
(https://www.rinfinance.com/diversity/) page for more information.

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time.
Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to
accompany the slides. Ideally, data sets should be made public for the
purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due
to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to innovative
research or presenters who have released R packages.

Limited financial assistance for conference admission may be available
to presenters. As R/Finance is a volunteer open source effort from
which organizers do not profit, resources are derived from
registrations and sponsorship alone. Requests for financial assistance
must be made at the time of submission, and the presenter should
clearly communicate to us why assistance is being requested. We
welcome requests from underrepresented minorities in Quantitative
Finance/STEM, and anyone researching under economic hardship.

Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a
final submission deadline of January 26th, 2024. Submitters will be
notified via email starting February 14, 2024 of acceptance and
presentation length.

Additional details will be announced via the conference website
http://www.RinFinance.com/ as they become available. Information on
previous years? presenters and their presentations are also at the
conference website. We will make a separate announcement when
registration opens.

You can submit your proposal at https://go.uic.edu/RFinanceCFP2024
