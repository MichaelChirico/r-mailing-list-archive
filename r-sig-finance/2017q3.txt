Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Estimating variance ratio test result
Message-ID: <CAFUu1y0sMpJHsM6T31v=ZC-69W0fpjJnrgQ24Rg+oH1VNZNcog@mail.gmail.com>

I'm testing whether a null hypothesis that a time series is random
walk is true. I use Auto.VR() and Lo.Mac() from R package "vrtest" for
variance ratio test to EURUSD. EURUSD log returns were the input.

How do we evaluate the result from Auto.VR() or Lo.Mac()? In other
words, how can we say that the null hypothesis is rejected from those
results?

Hi: I didn't look at the paper below but the critical values are probably
in there.

Message-ID: <253B4FA1ECEEB54DB661809CB6773455F69C8211@NOR-EXC01.northview.local>

Hi,
I'm working with the Discount Curve function found a case where the bootstrap failed when

Error message: Error: 1st iteration: failed at 1st alive instrument, pillar October 4th, 2017, maturity October 4th, 2017, reference date July 5th, 2017: negative time (-0.00273973) given


a)      Using a settlement date in parameter (t+2) and

b)      there's holiday.

I present below a reproducible example.

I would like to know if this is normal and how should I use the "settleDate "correctly.
Thank you

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] eigen value decomposition in RcppArmadillo
Message-ID: <CAG1eqLZxzjzBJ-WODQOF7fbmdV3NFEYON4MhRuugT2M=PZq-Sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to use the eigs_sym function from the Armadillo library, which
is basically a counterpart to the eigs_sym function from the rARPACK R
package that helps find a specified number of eigenvalues/vectors for a
square matrix.

I have a couple of questions -

1. I am only able to return the eigen values and not the eigen vector from
the armadillo implementation. Not sure if i need to return a different type
in order for the output to contain both the values and vector?

2. My understanding is that I am using the same input parameters but still
unable to replicate the results from the two implementations, even for the
eigen values that gets outputted from eigs_symC function in the example
below


Reproducible example -

#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
using namespace arma;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
mat eigs_symC(mat X, int k){
  sp_mat X2 = sp_mat(X);
  mat res = eigs_sym(X2, k);
  return res;
}



/*** R
x = matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)
rARPACK::eigs_sym(x, 5);
eigs_symC(x, 5);
*/


Due to my limited exposure with this particular R package itself, I am
unable to figure out the best way to go about tracking down this mismatch.
Any help would be much appreciated

Thank you

Hi all,

Apologize for a bug in my reproducible example, I forgot to do add the
transpose of x to the matrix x in order to make it symmetric. Also I found
out using - *eigs_sim(eigval, eigvec, X, k) *and returning eigval and
eigvec can return other components too.

Thank you and even though its 230 on a Friday afternoon, I hope I did not
end up wasting anybody's time.

Sending these 2 titles, maybe they are too general and scholastic, but I found them useful in order to combine theory and R coding together:

- Stefano M. Iacus (2011), Option Pricing and Estimation of Financial Models with R, Wiley & Sons, Chichester.

- Dalgaard, P. (2008), Introductory statistics with R, 3 Edition, Springer, New York.

How about:

pretty easy to read and implement maybe not as advanced but I find this might be a good starting point

Hi Jack,

These are not books---but given how wide "Finance" can be, it may be
helpful to look at the list of all related R packages and their
documentation:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html

There's a few books listed under that URL as well.

Regards.

Hi,

an idea:

- Statistical Analysis of Financial Data in R by Ren? Carmona.

- Analyzing Financial Data and Implementing Financial Models Using R by Clifford S. Ang.

- An introduction to analysis of Financial Data with R by Ruey S. Tay.

- An introduction to R for Quantitative Economics by Vikram Dayal.

- Quantitative Trading with R by Harry Georgakopoulos

But if you don?t know R (have you programming in any language?, do you manage statistics issues?) probably it?s better start with:

- Getting started with R 

- Introductory Statistics with R

Hi Mario,

I've just started with R in some small in-house projects. Thanks for the listed books, i think the #2 and #3 is best describe my situation here.

Hi,

an idea:

- Statistical Analysis of Financial Data in R by Ren? Carmona.

- Analyzing Financial Data and Implementing Financial Models Using R by Clifford S. Ang.

- An introduction to analysis of Financial Data with R by Ruey S. Tay.

- An introduction to R for Quantitative Economics by Vikram Dayal.

- Quantitative Trading with R by Harry Georgakopoulos

But if you don?t know R (have you programming in any language?, do you manage statistics issues?) probably it?s better start with:

- Getting started with R 

- Introductory Statistics with R

Mario

Many thanks Ed,

Just cant imagine how wide it really was. It is quantmod
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html> that i should
try now.

Thanks for advising.

My previous message was formatted as HTML and became garbled, so here it is as plain text, 
which I hope will work.

In the R package quantmod, using getSymbols in the evening used to get prices up to the latest 
close, but since Yahoo Finance changed their data service, it only gets data through yesterday. 
I suggest that getSymbols make a call to getQuote to see if more recent data can be appended 
to the end of the data returned. The script below explains what the problem is. Yahoo Finance 
"knows" the OHLCV data of today, but getSymbols does not return it. 

At 10:30 PM EST 2017-07-13 the output of 

options(warn=-1)

sym <- "SPY" 
xx <- getSymbols(sym,auto.assign=FALSE,from="1990-01-01") 
print(tail(xx))

Hi

I am most likely committing an error in trying to predict  using linear
regression lm model. please help me figure out what am I doing wrong. I am
trying to regress a index and its constituents. Here is the code


#split ts inttwo parts
a<-300;

x1<-x[1:a,];
y1<-y[1:a,];

x2<-x[(a+1):nrow(x),];
y2<-y[(a+1):nrow(y),];


#regression
m1<-lm( y1~x1)
r1<-residuals(m1)
coef(m1)

##out of sample
y_hat<-predict.lm(m1,x2);
r2<-y_hat-y2;


x,y are xts. X contains multiple time series. The y_ hat turns out to be of
300 samples only, whereas x2 contains 1400 samples.

Please help me figure out how to predict using model that I have found
using regression.

Hi Amol,

My guess is that you can't use lm() directly on xts objects.  See this:

Bad guess. :)

library(xts)
data(sample_matrix)
xtsObject <- as.xts(sample_matrix)
xtsObject$t <- seq_len(nrow(xtsObject))-1
lm(Open ~ t, data=xtsObject)

It's very difficult to help if you do not provide a reproducible
example.  Most people do not have, and will not spend, the time it
takes to imagine and create data required to reproduce the issue you
describe.

Hi Amol,

The lm function is not intended to be used in the way you are calling it.
Even though you can actually pass y and x as actual data in the formula
argument (y~x), its better to pass the data set in the data argument and
use column names in the formula argument especially when you want to use
the predict function on the fitted object as predict.lm looks for variables
in the function environment. In your example, newdata and those variables
would not have similar length that results in length of y_hat equal to 300.

Now there might be some clever way to get around this with the same
function call that you used (you can try playing with the variable name of
new data to be same as column names in x) but I would rather suggest using
this -

a<-300
data_fit = data.frame(x = matrix(rnorm(1700*5), ncol = 5), y =
matrix(rnorm(1700)))
data_fit_is = data_fit[1:a,] #In Sample
data_fit_os = data_fit[(a+1):nrow(data_fit), ] #Out of Sample
m1 = lm(y~., data = data_fit_is)
length(predict(m1, data_fit_os[, 1:5])) #Should be equal to 1400 now and
300 now

Hi,


I am trying to impliment a seemingly simple analysis in Quanstrat, but I am stuck.  Let's say that I have 50 futures in my data frame.  Each future is a time series of OHLC data.  I want to at each time stamp, compare the value of an indicator for each future and rank the futures accordingly.   For example, I want to rank the futures based on each's 5-day return.  How do I impliment this in Quanstrat?


So far, the only way I came up with go get around this is to pre-process each future's data then store the ranking data for each future in its own data set.  But this is not flexible and cumbersome.


Thank your for any suggestions, obviously I don't have a reproducible code yet.


Michael

Hi,

Well, reproducible code would get us all closer to making helpful
suggestions. Would you show us the code to read in two futures price streams
and make your calculation? Then we can see what the ranking problem is.

Thanks,

Hi Frank,


Thanks.  Yes,  reproducible code would be good, but unfortunately I have been struggling on that end, but I will try to put something together.  At the mean time, please let me explain the problem conceptually again, it may help.


Using Quantstrat, once you load the symbols and initialize the parameters,  I would define the indicators.  For example:


add.indicator(strategy.st, name = "runPercentRank",
              arguments = list(x = quote(Vo(mktdata)), n=90),
              label = "VolPctRnkX")


This indicator is just the running percent rank on Volume data for the past 90 days for each symbol.  Then I add signals and strategy rules, simple enough.    However,  as far as I can know,  strategy rules (signals and indicators) in quanstrat are applied to each symbol in the dataset sequentially and in chronological order.   Let's say, I have three futures in my dataframe:  AA, BB, and CC (as an example), the "VolPctRnkX" will be calculated for each future: AA, BB, CC.  If I examine the mktdata for each symbol (AA, BB, or CC), each will have a column data named "VolPctRankX"


My problem is that I want to compare this indictor "VolPctRnkX" for each symbol at each timestamp to that of other symbols.  In otherwords, ranks the sybmols according to its own "VolPctRnkX" value.  So, in this example,  at a particular date: "2010-10-01, the ranking could be  BB, CC, AA, based on each's "VolPctRankX" value on that day.

Symbol   VolPctRankX

BB            0.95

CC            0.85

AA            0.50


Then, I can make another indicator or rule using this ranking to size my order.  For this to work, there has to be cross-section (across symbols) comparasion at each time stamp.  How do I impliment this in the Quanstrat framework?


Is this a little clearer??


thanks again,


Michael

Hi,

Well, reproducible code would get us all closer to making helpful
suggestions. Would you show us the code to read in two futures price streams
and make your calculation? Then we can see what the ranking problem is.

Hi,


I am trying to impliment a seemingly simple analysis in Quanstrat, but I am
stuck.  Let's say that I have 50 futures in my data frame.  Each future is a
time series of OHLC data.  I want to at each time stamp, compare the value
of an indicator for each future and rank the futures accordingly.   For
example, I want to rank the futures based on each's 5-day return.  How do I
impliment this in Quanstrat?


So far, the only way I came up with go get around this is to pre-process
each future's data then store the ranking data for each future in its own
data set.  But this is not flexible and cumbersome.


Thank your for any suggestions, obviously I don't have a reproducible code
yet.


Michael

Hi Michael,

?but unfortunately I have been struggling on that end.? Show us your
struggles:

1)	Show us the code you have to read in three commodities. 
2)	Show us the code that calculates the indicator.

>From this code, I think I, or others, can point you in the right direction.
If steps 1 or 2 are not working, we can help you. 

>From your BB, CC, AA example, it looks like you are trying to reorder the
symbols. Don?t do that. Have an indicator

AA 3
BB 1
CC 2

Where BB is the first commodity to trade, CC is second and AA is third. 

" rule using this ranking to size my order"

I can't tell what order sizing rule you are trying to use. If you only trade
one commodity, then you need another column for the allowed size for BB in
this case, but for all commodities in case they are traded. What seems
likely is you want to trade more than one commodity up to a risk limit of
$100,000 as an example. If your size in BB is constrained to 100 contracts
which is $75,000 of risk, then you have up to $25,000 of risk to trade in
CC. If CC maxes out at 50 contracts with $20,000 of risk, then you would add
some size for AA.


Best,

Frank

Hi Frank,

Thanks.? Yes,? reproducible code would be good, but unfortunately I have
been struggling on that end, but I will try to put something together.? At
the mean time, please let me explain the problem conceptually again, it may
help.

Using Quantstrat, once you load the symbols and initialize the parameters,?
I would define the indicators.? For example:

add.indicator(strategy.st, name = "runPercentRank",
????????????? arguments = list(x = quote(Vo(mktdata)), n=90),
????????????? label = "VolPctRnkX")
This indicator is just the running percent rank on Volume data for the past
90 days for each symbol. ?Then I add signals and strategy rules, simple
enough. ?? However,? as far as I can know,? strategy rules (signals and
indicators) in quanstrat are applied to each symbol in the dataset
sequentially and in chronological order.?? Let's say, I have three futures
in my dataframe:? AA, BB, and CC (as an example), the "VolPctRnkX" will be
calculated for each future: AA, BB, CC.? If I examine the mktdata for each
symbol (AA, BB, or CC), each will have a column data named "VolPctRankX"

My problem is that I want to compare this indictor "VolPctRnkX" for each
symbol at each timestamp to that of other symbols.? In otherwords, ranks the
sybmols according to its own "VolPctRnkX" value.? So, in this example,? at a
particular date: "2010-10-01, the ranking could be? BB, CC, AA, based on
each's "VolPctRankX" value on that day. ? ?? 
Symbol ? VolPctRankX
BB ? ? ? ? ?? 0.95
CC ? ? ? ? ?? 0.85
AA ? ? ? ? ?? 0.50

Then, I can make another indicator or rule using this ranking to size my
order.? For this to work, there has to be cross-section (across symbols)

Thank you all for the response. I could resolve the issue by separating
formula and data. That is where I was committing error.

Joshua Ulrich
 I will try to send data set along  or ensure that the problem is
reproducible.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Different results of vcovCL (sandwich) and of
	cluster() in Stata
Message-ID: <CAOw5HqQbjMrcFqxiuVfx+rt=aXW3Oyv2yOBbknOqQKJK7z9oJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

(first of all, sorry for the crossposting. I sent this message to the
general R-list, but I noticed, this list is maybe more appropiate for this
question).

I'm trying to reproduce with R the results of this study:
https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=262406

More precisely I want to reproduce the results of the table 6 (pag.280),
which can also be seen here:
http://picpaste.de/pics/table-robin-llKCOeWV.1501745645.png

Let's take the 4th column: we have a coeff. of 0.042 and a SE of
0.036, which represents clustered robust standard errors. If I try to
reproduce in R the analysis, I get the same coefficient, but I'm not
able to get the same SE.

The author made the stata file available here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_QoCd-1jkVXTmNDWmViWkJFdmM/edit?usp=sharing
(see: http://www.jaredcrubin.com/research)

To make the regression, he uses (as far as I can understand the stata
code) the following command:

local conditions "city != "Mainz" & city != "Wittenberg" & city != "Z?rich""
local citysize "logpop1500 i.indepcity"
local demandcity "i.univ1450 i.bishop i.laymag"
probit prot`y' i.press `citysize' `demandcity' if `conditions', robust
cluster(territory)
    estpost margins, dydx(*)

I'm trying to translate this into R-code doing the following:

library(foreign)
library(dplyr)
library(sandwich)
library(margins)

# the data are here:
#
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_QoCd-1jkVXRGdUMTlkYTNiNGc/edit?usp=sharing
cities <- read.dta("data/Printing_and_Protestants_Data-ReStat.dta")

# we filter the data
cities <- filter(cities, !is.na(pop1500))
cities <- filter(cities, city != "Z?rich" & city != "Mainz" & city !=
"Wittenberg")

# the model
m1 <- glm(formula = factor(prot1530) ~ factor(press) + logpop1500 +
                factor(indepcity) + factor(univ1450) + factor(bishop) +
factor(laymag),
            family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = cities)

# calculate margins with clustered standard errors
m1.margins <- margins(m1, vcov = vcovCL(m1, cluster=cities$territory))

I tried different types (HC1, HC2, etc), but always the value for the SE
is not the same as in the table.

Any ideas?

Many thanks in advance.

Hello
I am reading?Diethelm W?rtz's Portfolio Optimization with R book. I encountered a problem at "17.2 How to Compute a Minimum Risk Efficient Portfolio" part. I entered the commands:

But I got the following output:

As you notice R does not compute Portfolio Weights, Target Returns and Risks... etc.
I also tried to run the code at "17.3 How to Compute the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio" which is:

But I got the following output:

As you see R does not make computations again.

I also tried to run the code at "17.4 How to Compute the Tangency Portfolio" which is:

> tgPortfolio <- tangencyPortfolio(data = lppData,spec = tgSpec,constraints = "LongOnly")

This time I got the following error:


Error in if (STATUS != 0) { : argument is of length zero

What may be the problem? Could you help?

Regrettably, Diethelm died in a car accident last year.  He is missed by 
many in this community who appreciated his advice, openness, and 
fostering of the community.

fPortfolio has not been updated for some time.  I would suggest looking 
at Berhard Pfaff's excellent risk and portfolio management book, as well 
as at packages such as PortfolioAnalytics for actually doing portfolio 
optimization in R.

I still refer to Diethelm's book for ideas and visualizations, but I do 
not use that code.

Regards,

Brian

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] NEW: rDotNet package
Message-ID: <DA1557D1-C81E-45E5-8019-07C2F0EAE9D1@gmail.com>

Hi,

I?ve published a new package on CRAN called ?rDotNet?.   The package allows one to call to .NET based code seamlessly from R, with .NET objects appearing as S4-style object proxies in the R session.   A similar package using this framework was made available for Python as well.   From R one can:

1. Create an instance of any .NET type (whether C#, F#, or otherwise)
2. Call methods on a type
3. Call functions (static methods / functions in modules)
4. Get / Set properties

One interacts with the package as:

require (rDotNet)

## optional initialization (dll location can also be set with an environment var)
.cinit (dll=?~/Dev/MyModels.dll?)

## create object
obj <- .cnew(?com.stg.models.UnivariateHawkes?, 10.0, 1e-2, 1e-3)

## call method ?F? on the object
excitation <- obj$F (2.5) 

I may add the ability to inline F# or C# code into R files at some point (much in the way Rcpp does), but for now requires that your F# or C# functions be compiled into a .NET assembly. 

For more information:

- https://github.com/tr8dr/.Net-Bridge <https://github.com/tr8dr/.Net-Bridge>

And the R package is available on CRAN:

- https://cran.r-project.org/package=rDotNet <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rDotNet>

Finally, the package has been tested on OS X (where I do most of my work), Linux, and Windows.   Note that for unix systems ?mono? or .NET core must be installed.   See the installation instructions for more information. 

regards
Jonathan

Although the last release to CRAN was in 2015 for PortfolioAnalytics, it is
still in active use and we are committed to maintaining it. In my opinion,
PortfolioAnalytics is the goto package for portfolio optimization... I am a
coauthor of the package so my opinion is biased.

For a backtesting package, I highly recommend quantstrat. It was built by
and is used by professional traders. The demos are a good place to start
for learning how to use the package.

Ross

Good morning all,
I agree with the prior message on all counts but I am also a big fan of SIT package.Here are the steps to install SIT, with the repo sit file (248 KB) attached below.
# https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT
install.packages('C:/Dropbox/QUANTstudio/R/sit', repos = NULL, type='source')?`SIT-package`

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] To obtain the t student of each rolling window with
	EGARCH model
Message-ID: <671759474.22806262.1505145792645.JavaMail.zimbra@univ-tours.fr>

Good Morning, 



I investigate the day-of ?the-week of 11 indices in 11 countries using EGARCH model and rolling sample method with one sample interval case of 500 days. The main purpose of the empirical analysis is to determine whether there exist calendar effects or not by observing whether the t values exceed the quantile of the standard normal distribution z = 1.96 for confidence level of 5%. I want to use the same method as Zhang, Lai, Lin (2017), ?the day-of-the-week effects of stocks markets in different countries?, Finance Research Letters 20. 



For the EGARCH model, I used Package ?Rugarch?, and everything is good : 



spec2b<-ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="eGARCH",garchOrder=c(1,1), external.regressors=L1), mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(0,0),archm=TRUE,archpow=1,external.regressors=L2), 

distribution.model = "std") 



fit2b<-ugarchfit(spec=spec2b,solver="hybrid", data=RENT) 

show(fit2b) 



But for the rolling sample method, with EGARCH(1,1), I thought using ?ugarchroll? or ?ugarchdistribution ?, to calculate the student t for each rolling window , but I do not get student t : 



dist <- ugarchdistribution(fit2b, n.sim = 500, n.start = 1, m.sim = 100, solver = "solnp") 

show(dist) 

or 

roll1=ugarchroll(spec1b,data = RENT,n.start = NULL,window.size = 500,solver = "solnp" ) 

show(roll1) 



Could you orient me to a solution ? 

Thank you very much

Have you tried 'coef(roll1)'?

I think the documentation is reasonably clear (?ugarchroll).
It returns an object of class 'uGARCHroll' (which is clickable in the 
documentation and will take you to the class help page).
In the class help page you will see that one of the methods on the class
is:

"coef
signature(object = "uGARCHroll"): Extracts the list of coefficients for 
each estimated window in the rolling backtest."

Therefore, coef(roll1) will return the list of coefficient matrices
per roll window, from which you can extract the shape parameter of the
standardized Student distribution.

Similarly, please read the documentation for ugarchdistribution.

Colleagues,

I am just learning about quantmod and I don?t understand the behavior of xts objects.

For example:
	getSymbols("AAPL?)
Creates an object AAPL

	tail(AAPL)
yields:
           AAPL.Open AAPL.High AAPL.Low AAPL.Close AAPL.Volume AAPL.Adjusted
2017-08-31    163.64    164.52   163.48     164.00    26785100        164.00
2017-09-01    164.80    164.94   163.63     164.05    16591100        164.05
2017-09-05    163.75    164.25   160.56     162.08    29468500        162.08

2017-09-07    162.09    162.24   160.36     161.26    21928500        161.26
2017-09-08    160.86    161.15   158.53     158.63    28352600        158.63

I would like to extract a row based on the date column.  The usual approaches (e.g., rownames) do not work.  

So, how do I extract the date column?

Ilya has already pointed out the index function.

Slightly more information is that xts objects don't have row names,
they have a time/date based index, and facilities to subset using that
index.  For the most part, you can do this as you would with a
data.frame, by exact index or by row number, but there are also many
other things that you can do as well.

I suggest taking a close look at the xts FAQ:

https://joshuaulrich.github.io/xts/xts_faq.html

Regards,

Brian

Dear Alexios

That's wonderful. Thanks to you I got what I was looking for several weeks. you are right, the documentation is very clear, but sometimes we do not see what may seem obvious to an expert eye.

Thanks a lot

Objet: Re: To obtain the t student of each rolling window with EGARCH model

Have you tried 'coef(roll1)'?

I think the documentation is reasonably clear (?ugarchroll).
It returns an object of class 'uGARCHroll' (which is clickable in the 
documentation and will take you to the class help page).
In the class help page you will see that one of the methods on the class
is:

"coef
signature(object = "uGARCHroll"): Extracts the list of coefficients for 
each estimated window in the rolling backtest."

Therefore, coef(roll1) will return the list of coefficient matrices
per roll window, from which you can extract the shape parameter of the
standardized Student distribution.

Similarly, please read the documentation for ugarchdistribution.
