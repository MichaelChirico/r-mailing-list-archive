Hi:

I am unable to use any function in fSeries 240.10068.
For example,
garchFit(ts(ret)~arma(1,1)+garch(1,1))
is giving
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : could not find function 
".modelSeries"
source("/usr/local/lib/R/library/fSeries/demo/xmpDWChapter034.R")
is giving
Error in parse(file, n = -1, NULL, "?") : syntax error at
1096:       )
1097:     )
armaFit(x ~ arma(2, 1)) is giving
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object "package" not found

Can someone please help? Thanks in advance.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Interpretation of results from ca.jo in urca package
Message-ID: <BAY134-F29701172B6F3A2AC64CD86C5640@phx.gbl>

Hello

I am using the ca.jo function in urca 1.0-9 running inside R-2.4.1. I have 
been performing cointegration analysis on log stock-price time series; I am 
looking for co-integration between pairs of stocks. I am not testing the 
log-price of the stock explicitly for I(1), as I am taking it as a given. 
Nonetheless I sometimes get results of the form:

######################
# Johansen-Procedure #
######################

Test type: trace statistic , without linear trend and constant in 
cointegration

Eigenvalues (lambda):
[1] 1.662315e-02 6.273138e-03 2.383972e-18

Values of teststatistic and critical values of test:

          test 10pct  5pct  1pct
r <= 1 |  7.05  2.82  3.96  6.94
r = 0  | 25.82 13.34 15.20 19.31


which lead me to reject the hypothesis of at most one cointegrating vector, 
and therefore that all the variables must be I(0), which is not the case. 
Any idea what might be going wrong?

Secondly, when I get a result which means I cannot reject (at the 5% level) 
the likelihood of more than 1 co-integrating vectors (ie. the original 
series were I(1)), then which matrix should I use to generate a series of 
residuals; is it PI?, for example:

######################
# Johansen-Procedure #
######################

Test type: trace statistic , without linear trend and constant in 
cointegration

Eigenvalues (lambda):
[1] 2.198524e-02 3.078562e-03 9.978092e-18

Values of teststatistic and critical values of test:

          test 10pct  5pct  1pct
r <= 1 |  3.45  2.82  3.96  6.94
r = 0  | 28.35 13.34 15.20 19.31

Eigenvectors, normalised to first column:
(These are the cointegration relations)

           datai.l1  dataj.l1   constant
datai.l1  1.0000000  1.000000  1.0000000
dataj.l1 -0.4417583 -0.565435  0.7770033
constant -0.8937223 -0.431884 -9.0212883

Weights W:
(This is the loading matrix)

            datai.l1      dataj.l1      constant
datai.d -0.035998263 -0.0009870617 -3.549719e-17
dataj.d  0.004612461 -0.0021116569 -2.171292e-17

(my print-out)

[1] "PI"
            datai.l1      dataj.l1     constant
datai.d -0.036985325  0.0164606502  0.032598747
dataj.d  0.002500804 -0.0008435882 -0.003210269

because sometimes I get very different looking residual series depending on 
whether I use the first or second row of PI to construct the series. 
Sometimes the residual series looks like a straight line which never crosses 
zero when I use row one, and for row two looks like a classic AR(m) series 
mean-reverting around zero (which is what I would expect), or vice-versa. 
Can anyone explain what is going on ?

Caveat: this is my first time using R (or any other s/w) to apply 
theoretical results to real data.

Kind regards

Bill

Hi, maybe you should try:

model<-~arma(1,1)+~garch(1,1)
garchFit(model, data)

@ armaFit(x ~ arma(2, 1)) I don't this expression
maybe try 

arima(data, order=c(2,0,1))

This is my first post to this list, so apologies in advance if I am doing

My question is if anyone has wrapped the C++ SDK version of FinCad Developer
http://www.fincad.com/ into R. I am aware that it is possible, but also that
each function must be wrapped individually. I wanted to know if anyone had
begun this process and we could share the code/work. I know that RMetrics
and QuantLib exist and are open source, but they do not have enough of the
analytics yet to be a complete solution.

Thanks,

Hi Ryan,

I've considered this and have corresponded with one of fincad's
developers regarding R wrappers to the developer kit. I'll email the
correspondence to you directly as it contains allot of useful sample
code.

Do you want to do this on windows or linux? I might be interested in
working with you on this.. need to decide whether I need it enough to
warrant the cost (around 15k usd, if i remember correctly).

Regards,
Robert

Hi, 
I have a data.frame as following,

     	   DATE TICKER    CLOSE

19 2000-07-21    	DD 4.56250
20 2000-07-28     DD 4.18750

I wanna generate a matrix based on this data.frame has the TICKER as row nams and DATE as column names.
The matrix should be look like this:
	
	2000-06-30	2000-07-07	2000-07-14	2000-07-21	2000-07-28
A 	73.75000	 67.43750	 76.87500 	47.50000	 41.31250
BB	.....
CC	.....
DD	.....

Is there any easy way to do that?
One problem is there maybe TICKER doesn't have 5 CLOSEs.

Thanks for any suggestion!!!

Brian

Use merge.  You can omit the varying= argument and the line before
the merge statement if you are not too fussy about the column names.

DF <- head(DF, 19) # last ticker now only has 4 closes
DATE.names <- unique(as.character(DF$DATE))
reshape(DF, direction = "wide", idvar = "TICKER", timevar = "DATE",
   varying = list(DATE.names))

Thanks for the input. Yes, the previous version fSeries 201.10060
works fine. However in this version one cannot simultaneously fit
an ARMA-GARCH model. One has to first fit ARMA and then fit GARCH
to its residuals separately which is not same as ARMA-GARCH. Thus
any help in this regard (with say fSeries 201.10060 or the tseries
package) will be highly appreciated.

I'm not familiar with FinCad.  Could you comment on what you've found
to be its particular strengths vs. weaknesses?  And perhaps
compare/contrast it to other libraries out there, e.g. TIPS for bonds,
or NAG for stuff that's not necessarily finance specific?

Also, how do they license FinCad, and what's its ballpark cost?  (They
don't seem to have that info on their website.)

I've used FinCadXL for over a year. So far, all calculations approximate
reasonably well to bloomberg analytics and dealer valuations (although I
use it primarily for pricing vanilla swaps, swaptions, and bond math).
It is the most comprehensive function suite for interest rate
derivatives and benefits from being (I think) the most widely used
library in the industry. Documentation is reasonably good.

But it is a binary-only library. The world would be a better place if
there was critical mass behind something like QuantLib.

FinCad can be used to price derivatives. It's distributed in Excel lib
(FinCad XL) and C++ lib.

By the way, Ryan and Robert, do you have any commnet on FinCad? I
recently used FinCad to price a CMS spread note, but found the price
much different from the dealer's quotes.

There really should be!!  The Quantlibbers just sent out something
like a call for 'wider participation' on the -devel list.  

My RQuantLib project was always meant as 'proof of concept' only -- if
folks want to contribute I am more than happy to include their code,
or to replace mine.  Dominick's rather nice additions are a good
example.

Also, Joe Wang did some fabulous work with the _automated_ SWIG glue
that provides essentially _all_ QL functions directly to R. Still not
that easy to use and somewhat heavy on memory but way more than a start.

So if a few people would make a serious push, we could have some
really sharp R/QL integration in a matter of weeks.  Some C++ needed,
of course, but doable on both major OS flavours.

First thanks for everyone's responses. I will try to hit all of the
questions in one email:

1) FinCAD is a commercially available library of financial functions that is
available in Excel form
(http://www.fincad.com/default.asp?id=2000&s=Products&n=FINCAD%20XL) and a
developer library
(http://www.fincad.com/default.asp?id=2100&s=Products&n=Fincad%20Developer).

2) Online they have a list of functions that they offer and the User Guide:
http://www.fincad.com/default.asp?id=17300&s=Support&n=References

3) They have competitors in the space, (http://www.techhackers.com/) FinCAD
is just the one I have used in the past and have found to be the best for my
uses.

4) The cost is about $3,500 for the Excel license, and the developer code is
about $15k for the base and then I think you pay per user. Certainly not
cheap, but in the world of trading  technology the numbers are small.

5) What does FinCAD have that is good, in my mind the following:
	a) Extensive product coverage (interest rates, options, and credit)
	b) their functions conform to market standards
	c) as a firm I found them very responsive
	d) documentation is clearly written and usable to non-technologists

6) Price matching. Generally speaking any pricing formula that is not closed
form will mean that any two sources (FinCAD v. dealers) will have different
prices, because the price is model based and require assumptions. For
example Bermudian options, no 2 dealers will agree on the price. Also having
worked at a dealer, I can say that there is no reason to assume that dealer
pricing is "correct". I have seen plenty of bad code, and in some ways when
you only have one captive customer (your in-house desk), the quality control
is going to be less than a FinCAD or QuantLib with many eyes. Either way, I
think FinCAD has enough users that any bad pricing is corrected.

OK, so where does that take us. Several people have expressed similar
interest in R<>FinCAD connection, so perhaps Eric and myself can co-ordinate
something where we share the effort.

All that said, I definitely think something like QuantLib is a better long
term solution. The blockage for me is:

	a) There is no modeling for credit, which is 1/2 of what we do
	b) The documentation is written for programmers from what I can see,
so deploying it to end users means writing user docs. (if I am wrong please
direct me, I tried to search for it). Difficult to tell from the docs what
the financial math behind the functions is.

We would like to assist in making QuantLib the best solution so that it has
the models, and the R connectivity. Can someone recommend the lists or sites
we should connect with to get involved? Thanks.

There really should be!!  The Quantlibbers just sent out something like a
call for 'wider participation' on the -devel list.  

My RQuantLib project was always meant as 'proof of concept' only -- if folks
want to contribute I am more than happy to include their code, or to replace
mine.  Dominick's rather nice additions are a good example.

Also, Joe Wang did some fabulous work with the _automated_ SWIG glue that
provides essentially _all_ QL functions directly to R. Still not that easy
to use and somewhat heavy on memory but way more than a start.

So if a few people would make a serious push, we could have some really
sharp R/QL integration in a matter of weeks.  Some C++ needed, of course,
but doable on both major OS flavours.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] PerformanceAnalytics R package for Performance and
	Risk Analysis (v0.9.4)
Message-ID: <200704151141.21909.brian@braverock.com>

PerformanceAnalytics R package for Performance and Risk Analysis

We are pleased to release for the use and review of our peers and mentors
this R package of econometric tools for performance and risk analysis.

This version, v0.9.4, is the second public release of the 
PerformanceAnalytics package, and the first release to CRAN. This version 
adds significantly to the documentation and examples over that included 
with version 0.9.3.  We have also added a few additional utility and 
wrapper functions where we felt they would be of general utility.

PerformanceAnalytics R package version 0.9.4 (v1.0rc2)

Econometric tools for performance and risk analysis.

Description:
Library of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis of
financial portfolios. This library aims to aid practitioners and
researchers in using the latest research in analysis of both normal and
non-normal return streams.

We created this library to include functionality that has been appearing
in the academic literature on performance analysis and risk over the past
several years, but had no functional equivalent in R.  In doing so, we
also found it valuable to have wrapper functions for functionality easily
replicated in R, so that we could access that functionality using a
function with defaults and naming consistent with common usage in the
finance literature. The package covers Performance Analysis, Risk
Analysis (with a separate treatment of VaR), Summary Tables of related
statistics, Charts and Graphs, a variety of Wrappers and Utility
functions, and some thoughts on work yet to be done.

This R package contains over 80 original functions, and several
additional wrappers to simplify parameters or provide accessible names
for other functionality.

I suggest that you start with the summary documentation, either via the
attached PerformanceAnalytics-package.pdf
or as HTML or PDF with links here:
http://braverock.com/brian/R/PerformanceAnalytics-package.html
http://braverock.com/brian/R/PerformanceAnalytics-package.pdf

Below please find the index summary of all the functions included in the
documentation.

Regards,

Package now on CRAN in source form here:

http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/PerformanceAnalytics.html

no sign of binaries for Windows or OS X yet, so the Windows binary from 
Martin is still the best bet for now.  Binaries for other platforms 
should appear at the link above as the CRAN binary maintainers compile 
and test them.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] How to produce vector of correlation matrices
Message-ID: <BAY113-F13B556506AE26211EAFAA7EE510@phx.gbl>

Folks,

I have a matrix of equity returns with rownames as dates and colnames as 
stock codes. I'd like to compute
a rolling vector of correlation matrices, one matrix for each date. Is there 
a nifty way to accomplish this?

E.g if my matrix is

		AAA	BBB	CCC	DDD	EEE
01/01/2007	10%	60%	49%	99%	99%
02/01/2007	42%	91%	72%	57%	79%
03/01/2007	25%	100%	76%	40%	17%
04/01/2007	99%	98%	81%	100%	13%
05/01/2007	74%	49%	85%	24%	69%
06/01/2007	9%	43%	57%	57%	1%
07/01/2007	77%	53%	84%	70%	57%
08/01/2007	98%	66%	24%	28%	77%
09/01/2007	1%	43%	72%	82%	1%
10/01/2007	14%	22%	18%	43%	27%
11/01/2007	15%	5%	62%	34%	3%
12/01/2007	70%	63%	59%	92%	57%
13/01/2007	27%	58%	12%	31%	68%
14/01/2007	15%	90%	48%	16%	66%
15/01/2007	86%	6%	52%	95%	3%

and I take a roll period of 10 days, my vector of correlation matrices might 
look like:

10/01/2007:

	AAA	BBB	CCC	DDD	EEE
AAA	1.00	0.38	0.19	-0.17	0.29
BBB	0.38	1.00	0.44	0.16	0.10
CCC	0.19	0.44	1.00	0.26	-0.15
DDD	-0.17	0.16	0.26	1.00	-0.11
EEE	0.29	0.10	-0.15	-0.11	1.00

11/01/2007:

	AAA	BBB	CCC	DDD	EEE
AAA	1.00	0.47	0.14	0.07	0.61
BBB	0.47	1.00	0.37	0.32	0.30
CCC	0.14	0.37	1.00	0.41	-0.06
DDD	0.07	0.32	0.41	1.00	-0.38
EEE	0.61	0.30	-0.06	-0.38	1.00

etc.

I looked at the fMultivar and fPortfolio packages which do funky stuff with 
return series,
but they (as far as I can tell) produce an overall covariance matrix, not a 
rolling one as I need.

Thanks,

Murali
PS: Of course, if my equity returns looked as they do above, I'd have 
retired aeons ago :-)

Hi Guillaume,

Thanks for this. I couldn't get your lapply() code to work as is because of 
the following error:

Error in FUN(X[[1]], ...) : unused argument(s) (function (i, X, win)

but the following did the trick:

>res <- lapply(vec, function(i) cor(X[(i - win + 1) : i, ]))

where 'win' and 'X' were as per your definitions.

Cheers,
Murali

FinCad can be used to price derivatives. It's distributed in Excel lib
(FinCad XL) and C++ lib.

By the way, Ryan and Robert, do you have any commnet on FinCad? I
recently used FinCad to price a CMS spread note, but found the price
much different from the dealer's quotes.

I was writing a simple code to compare different Moving Averages (using
rollmean).

CODE:
**************************************************************
FX.Window.A <- 5

FX.Window.B <- 20

FX.Window.Max <- 100

 

FX.Price <- read.csv("MAFX.csv")

FX.Price <- na.omit(FX.Price[,2])

#summary(FX.Price)

 

#FX.Date <-  na.omit(FX.Price[,1])

#FX.Date

FX.Date <- "2007-01-11"

FX.Price <- zooreg(FX.Price,start=as.Date(FX.Date))

 

Mean.Result = c()

  for(i in 1:FX.Window.Max){

    FX.Window.A[i+1] <- rollmean(FX.Price,FX.Window.A[i])

    Mean.Result[i]=FX.Window.A[i+1]

}

 

Rollmean.A <- rollmean(FX.Price,FX.Window.A)

Rollmean.B <- rollmean(FX.Price,FX.Window.B)
**************************************************************

I tried to open a vector for storing the results but I got an error
message - 'cause the longer the windows the less results you get. 

Do you know some ways to fill the missing data?

Hope you can help me guys. I just switched to R and therefore a
semi-novice.

Thanks a lot.

I have the same problem with vectors of different length, most packages don't
know how to scale and adjust timeseries / vectors of different length. It
would be a welcome contribution to R Finance if any programmer out there
could solve this problem in an easy way.


Manu do a dim(vector) to check length of your vectors / matrices that you
want to compare. As an example, if i want to calculate the annualized
standard deviation (sigma) for n-periods i do the following on each vector,
this example vector is days.

sd(vector[(length(vector)-n):length(vector)]) * sqrt(252)



Kind regards

All of the major time series classes handle series of different lengths.

a <- ts(1:3); b <- ts(12:15, start = 2)
a + b
a == b

library(zoo)
az <- as.zoo(a); bz <- as.zoo(b)
az + bz
az == bz

harvey, ruiz and shepard ( 1992 ) have a paper on how to transform a
stochastic volatility model to a state space form.
Maybe there is a reference there or an idea for how to do the same for
CIR ? My guess is that it's
been done by someone somewhere but that's thew most I can tell you.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Cox, Ingersoll,Ross/Vasicek parameter
estimation via Kalman-Filter (SSPIR)

Dear R-Users,

 

I am trying to estimate the parameters for a CIR 1-/2-/3-Factor model
via Kalman filtering. The idea was to do it via the package SSPIR, but I
have problems to transform the CIR state space form into the SSPIR
syntax.
Actually, I am not quite sure if this is possible at all. 

 

Did anybody already realise a CIR/Vasicek -parameter estimation via R? 

 

To get an idea how a CIR-1-factor state space form looks like (Y= vector
of zerobond-yields with the maturities tau at month t):

 

Y(t,tau)= ( -1/tau * log A(tau) ) + (1/tau * B(tau) * x(t) + e

 

Where :

 

A(tau) = [(2 * h * e^( a + lambda + h) * tau/2) / (2 * h + (a + lambda +
h)
* (e^(tau * h) - 1)] ^(2 * b/ sigma^2)

B(tau) = [(2 * (e^(tau * h)  -1)) / 2 * h + (a + lambda + h) * (e^(tau *
h)
- 1)]

h = sqrt[(a + lambda)^2 + 2*sigma^2] 

 

which means that, besides the time varying factor x, the parameters a,
b, sigma, and lambda have to be estimated via Kalman filtering.

 

Is it possible to implement this in SSPIR? If you have any other
suggests or if you already implement comparable models in R, I would be
very grateful for your help.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Arne Krombach

In my survey paper http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/statespacesurvey.pdf
, I have an example of estimating a simple Vasicek model using state space
methods in splus. With the more complicated CIR process the Kalman filter
recursions have to be modified because the state vector influences the
variance of the process.

I've previously used the sde package to model CIR and Vasicek processes 
for term structure problems:

Arne,
together with Martin Keller-Ressel we did estimations of the Vasicek
and CIR termstructure, based on today's yield curve (so this is
different from your approach). We used R for the estimation. Let me
know if you are further interested (eg in some code).
We recognized that the yield curves of these (and every other affine
model) models do just allow for three different shapes, even if you
allow for jumps. You can get the preprint at
http://www.fam.tuwien.ac.at/~thomas/getfile.php?file=yieldcurves

Hi Gyadav,

I had close look at your code, I understood a lot, but not everything.
Anyway it looks nice.

Why do you execute this in a loop 10000 times? You don't want to crate
so many plot, don't you? ;)
is Years==seq(from=0,to=10,length=301) ?
Why do you do all this "rep"lication? vector+real=vector!?
Did I understand this correctly that you simulate short rates (=spot
rates) and then the corresponding yield curve? Why do you do this with
a simulation? You could calculate the term structure from you
parameters immediately!

best,
Thomas

Thank you for you reply,

i am a novice when it comes to CRAN R, i haven't looked much outside
rMetrics so far.
My recurring problem is daily financial data of different length, the
procedure you
describe below are two separate ways to align timeseries or should it be
done as one
command? If it has to be done in two stages as you describe it is a very
time consuming
way to handle all the financial data that, i guess anyone, would put to use
in finance R.

Kind regards

the code shows two examples.  The first using "ts" class series and the
second with "zoo" series.

Non-aligned timeseries data is *always* a problem, in any statistical 
language or data environment which I have ever been introduced to.

As Gabor points out, all timeseries classes in R can handle timeseries of 
different lengths.  In the zoo library, there are many na.rm function 
parameters to tell zoo what you want to do with missing data.  See the 
zoo documentation for more information, but I assume in most cases with 
daily data, you'd want to use na.contiguous or na.interp to fill in the 
blanks.  Of course, this all depends on your data, and what you are 
trying to accomplish.

Hi,

I did have the same problem and was not able to use the SSPIR or the
sde packages for the CIR model (for Vasicek's the SSPIR worked fine for me)
because the sde package assumes that the volatility is constant and although the SSPIR allows the user to define a function to specify
a time-varying volatility, as far as I can tell there is no way to
make the volatility dependent on the value of the state variable, as assumed by the CIR model.

So, I've programmed myself a small function, (in the bottom
of this message) which I called kalmanf, to perform the kalman
recursions with a state-dependent volatility. See if that is
useful to you (any feed-back is also very welcomed).

Note however that kalmanf does not estimate any parameter by itself,
only takes a set of parameters as given, together with the output of 
a state-space model, and returns the output likelihood and, if required,
some additional information. In order to estimate the model parameters
you will need to combine the likelihood computations given by kalmanf with some optimization procedure using R optimization tools such as the optim or nlminb R routines. I've been trying that approach with mixed success, mainly because the likelihood function is very irregular and with many
local maxima and to get some reasonably credible values for the maximum-likelihood parameters, the optimization needs to be started many times from
different starting points. 

I'll be very interested in hearing the experiences of anybody else who tried to solve the same problem.

Dear R-Users,

 

I am trying to estimate the parameters for a CIR 1-/2-/3-Factor model via
Kalman filtering. The idea was to do it via the package SSPIR, but I have
problems to transform the CIR state space form into the SSPIR syntax.
Actually, I am not quite sure if this is possible at all. 

 

Did anybody already realise a CIR/Vasicek -parameter estimation via R? 

 

To get an idea how a CIR-1-factor state space form looks like (Y= vector of
zerobond-yields with the maturities tau at month t):

 

Y(t,tau)= ( -1/tau * log A(tau) ) + (1/tau * B(tau) * x(t) + e

 

Where :

 

A(tau) = [(2 * h * e^( a + lambda + h) * tau/2) / (2 * h + (a + lambda + h)
* (e^(tau * h) - 1)] ^(2 * b/ sigma^2)

B(tau) = [(2 * (e^(tau * h)  -1)) / 2 * h + (a + lambda + h) * (e^(tau * h)
- 1)]

h = sqrt[(a + lambda)^2 + 2*sigma^2] 

 

which means that, besides the time varying factor x, the parameters a, b,
sigma, and lambda have to be estimated via Kalman filtering.

 

Is it possible to implement this in SSPIR? If you have any other suggests or
if you already implement comparable models in R, I would be very grateful
for your help.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Arne Krombach

as for the sde package (never finished, me culpa) I suggest to use a  
smarter simulation scheme then default method which is Euler+Error  
Prediction. In particular for CIR you might want to use the exact law  
of the increments (i.e. the exact transition density). To speed up MC  
analysis, you can use parameter "M" which generates for the same  
model, M independent trajectories returning  a mts object (instead of  
a simple ts one)

I don't know if this is useful for your problem though.

I use financial data from Yahoo and it is of low quality i.e dirty but still
very popular since it's free. As an example, i want to compare the Swedish
stocks ABB, Ericsson and Skanska to the Stockholm OMX30 Index using various
measures available in rmetrics and the performanceanalytics packages. The
download procedure looks like this for each symbol which should result in
four vectors with the same length:

OMX30 <- get.hist.quote("^OMX",start=(today <- Sys.Date())-700, quote =
c("Close"), provider = c("yahoo"), retclass = c("zoo"))

> dim(OMX30)
[1] 451   1
> dim(ABB)
[1] 489   1
> dim(ERIC)
[1] 491   1
> dim(SKAB)
[1] 491   1


Solution - a Bloomberg terminal with high quality data?

With free data sources, for indexes in particular, they often only have 
monthly data back beyond a certain point.

One trick here is to use the length of your shortest vector.  If your data 
source doesn't have data for a particular series back far enough, then 
use the start date of your shortest series as the start date for 
retrieving all the other series.

Another option, as I mentioned in my post yesterday, would be to use 
na.contiguous or one of the other NA handlers with zoo.  get.hist.quote 
returns zoo objects.  So, if you combine all your historical data in one 
zoo object with multiple data columns, one of the na. methods should 
allow you to get back only the aligned series.

> Solution - a Bloomberg terminal with high quality data?

This will help, but it won't eliminate your problem, in R or any other 
environment.  For researchers who need really clean historical data over 
very long time periods, data from CRSP is often used, but this makes 
Bloomberg look cheap.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Yet another GARCH-T question
Message-ID: <645496.58599.qm@web30811.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

What is the best way to fit a Student

i.e.



garchFit(formula, data, init.rec = c("mci",

"dsnorm", "dged", "dsged", "dstd",

Is there a quick way to get this done?

I have the following; How do I convert
it to a Student T GARCH



 fit <- garch(GHRT, order=c(1,1))



I have tried the following and I can't
get it to work.



> garchFit(formula.var = ~garch(1,
1), series=GHRT, cond.dist ="dstd")

Error in .modelSeries(fake = FALSE,
lhs = TRUE) : 

        argument
"formula" is missing, with no default





Also I can not find help on the following.

Well, after browsing the zoo documentation i found a wealth of information,
it's all there.
Solving my problem with differenth length of the benchmark index and stocks
i want to
compare the zoo documentation suggested the following

zoo(x, order.by = index(x), frequency = NULL)


Full documentation here:

Thank you

Anyone -

RBloomberg doesn't support downloading bulk data items from Bloomberg.
I wanted to download the option chains and dividend histories for
several equities.  I read the sources for RBloomberg to try to see if
I could patch it, but stopped short because I was getting distracted
from the goal of downloading the data.    Below is the code and some
notes I used to download the information I wanted using WinXP and
R-2.5.0.  I'm sure there are more robust ways, but this one met my
needs.

If you run the code below you should get an error returned for the
option chain (OPT_CHAIN) for the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund (VFINX
Equity) but everything else will return usable data.  Its my
understanding that there are over 400 bulk download fields available,
and I've only tested these functions with 10 of them.  You must have
Bloomberg installed on the machine you run this code on.

Anyone - 

We have been working on a predictive default model for residential
mortgages using the logistic regression functions in r.  We have had
satisfactory results in finding predictive independent variables. We are
now attempting to build confidence intervals.  We used the vcov function
to obtain the variance and covariance coefficients.  Is there a function
in r that will use the results of the vcov function that can be run
against the data to obtain the covariance value?  We have numerous
variables and are finding it difficult at best to accomplish outside of
a program.

Any help would be much appreciated

Have you considered using bootstrap regression (see Efron and Tibshirani).  You consider a sample of regression models with bootstrapped data samples.  From that, you can construct confidence intervals on the parameters of interest.

Best regards,

Hi Gyadav,

Here is some sample code to show my estimation. It uses optim() to estimate.

Hello,

I tried to wrote a little function establishing a socketConnection
to IB TWS. (aping c code from TWS API)
I'm newbie with R connection functions ... and it does not go very far.
I tried many combinations ... but not the good ones !
If a TWS user here has already done something like that,
could you please push me a bit in the right direction.
Thanks
Vincent (on windowsXP, R 2.4.1 (yes I'll upgrade)).

#==============================================
# TWS has to be running

connectToTWS = function()
{
TWS_PORT_NUMBER = 7496;
CLIENT_VERSION  = '30';
HOST            = '127.0.0.1';

con  = socketConnection(HOST, port=TWS_PORT_NUMBER, server=FALSE,
       blocking = TRUE, open = "w+", encoding = getOption("encoding"));

print(isOpen(con));     # TRUE : seems to work up to here

#write(CLIENT_VERSION, con, sep='');
#writeLines(CLIENT_VERSION, con, sep='')

hallo to all,

dirk eddelbuettel previously implemented an interface to LIM (see
http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/papers/r_lim_bloomberg.pdf) but in 
a recent correspondence he let me know that he no longer
has access to the code (it's proprietary anyway).

has anyone else tried this? there's some limited 
support from the LIM folks (see http://www.lim.com/download/splus.html)
in the form of "this *should* work for R". has anyone got 
an interface to LIM up and running? 

cheers, thomas.

Mel,

With respect connecting to the IB tws, where you are able to open a socket,
and write to it, but do not receive the handshake response in time:

> I tried to wrote a little function establishing a socketConnection ...

> connectToTWS = function()
> {
        ...
> res = readLines(con, 1);    # would like to get something here !

        ...
> }

If we grant that the design approach you take is feasible, about which more
later, then you need a timeout.  It looks like your code has a race condition;
you are likely to read from the socket before results have arrived.  If
you are determined to take this approach, you may want to insert sleep
delays here and there, at least for debugging purposes.

________________________________________________________________________________

Summary of what follows:

    * The IB tws api is not, in my opinion, convenient for synchronous use
      by a controlling R process

    * Another system, the trading shim, provides a command interpreter input
      interface, though message responses from the tws may be out of order,
      so that it can not achieve a true RPC interface.

    * The two ways I see to make the IB tws api accessible from R involve
      either:

        + limiting ourselves to synchronous requests only (e.g., history),
          and accepting high latencies, awkward error-handling, and clumsy
          timeouts

          OR

        + providing full scheduler task loop logic on the client side,
          mirroring similar code in the shim.

    * The trading shim can be used to support either of the above approaches.

    * I'm interested in knowing if anyone on this list has comments on
      how the shim should be integrated with R.

________________________________________________________________________________

Off topic warning:

*** Much of the following may or may not be of interest to most R users,
*** and in case that be true, I suggest an alternative list near the end
*** of this post.

Now, about the design.  Viewing the IB servers and external markets as
upstream, the problem is how to achieve downstream control of the tws
interface.

It would certainly be convenient to have synchronous control of the IB tws,
in effect a remote procedure call interface, though unfortunately, I believe
this to be infeasible.

After all, the tick data streams are asynchronous, and the delays for history
data can be worst case unpleasantly long.   If you want to combine such
queries and subscriptions with orders, the various latencies are all over
the map, and in any case orders themselves are fundamentally async; you may
be able to shoehorn the common case into a sync inteface, but it's the
uncommon case that will eat you alive.  And finally, how do you integrate error
handling and timeouts?

Ulimately, I believe you need another process between the client code and
the IB tws, one that simplifies the IB tws protocol, and converts between
text for the downstream, and the binary tws api.  I also accept that, for
the general case, the resulting text outupt must be processed by downstream
programs that are themselves able to handle asynchronous events, such as
timeouts and error messages.

We're working on such a system, the trading-shim, and to make a long story
short, it boils down to a database-augmented command intepreter.  The database
works to simplify the command protocol; the text commands from the downstream
can be short and simple, since they can use database keys to stand for
contracts, order line items, and the like.  The command interpreter also
converts the binary IB tws api to a text stream, so that standard filters
become applicable.

Please consider joining the ts-general at trading-shim.org mailing list if
you are interested, see http://www.trading-shim.org/mailman/listinfo
for details.  The trading-shim is GPL, and available from:

    http://www.trading-shim.com/

________________________________________________________________________________

Now, back to R, and about tying R and the shim together.  I believe it's
well worth doing, but our resources, and in particular time, are very much
finite.

One possible design might involve yet another program, a downstream
script that drives both R and the shim.  After all, command interpreters are
designed to (surprise) accept commands, and both systems are command
interpreters.  Note that we haven't yet implemented this kind of R:shim
system.

The downstream script would poll on sockets for the two interpreters, e.g.,
with a bsd-style select.  It would send commands to the shim to subscribe
to or query for data, capture the resulting market data and history
information, store that data or otherwise provide it to the R process, and 
ask for analysis as needed.

I'm interested in what the R experts on this list think about the problem
of tying the two interpreters together.  The issue I see is that any
client program has to poll, handle async events, and in practice provide
a task loop.  I've implemented such logic in the shim itself, but I suspect
that it is often an unpleasant surprise to developers of downstream clients
that they must do the same.

For those who prefer to treat the shim process as subordinate to R, there
would an be upfront time cost while the shim read in its database and connected
to the IB tws, and then commands could be written to the shim, and results
read back.  The initial connection would necessarily be static state; due
to limitations of the IB tws, fast connect-disconnect cycles are a bad idea.

***NOTE:*** The code to understand the resulting output is nontrivial.  There
are on the order of 80 or so command, message, request, and comment events
that can be echoed to the downstream at the highest level of verbosity.  This
includes in particular a lot of tws api requests and message types, and it all
adds up.  The shim commands themselves are very simple, and basic clients can
just ignore most lines of message text, filtering by prefix.

By the way, for the simple case of history queries, and where latency and
reliability are not critical issues, synchrony is straight forward; start
the shim, write history queries to it, and read the results from the text
messages file.

One problem here is upstream history farm disconnects and resource limits;
it's important for downstream clients to watch for and understand error
messages, as well as to react to timeouts when the upstream chooses to
ignore the query because load limits were exceeded.

Thanks,

Bill Pippin

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Plotting 2 option value lines
Message-ID: <4EFD7FEC-0F00-4205-BAC0-597F1A41DD57@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to learn how to use R to do some very basic things with  
the fOptions package.  At the moment I'm just trying to create a  
simple plot with two lines, one depicting the theoretical value of an  
option with time to expiration equal to approx. 3 months, and the  
other line depicting the value at expiration.  This is basically what  
I've done:

 > x <- (50:80)
 > c1 <- GBSOption(TypeFlag="c", S=x, X=65, Time=1/4, r=.08, b=.08,  
sigma=.3)@price
 > c2 <- GBSOption(TypeFlag="c", S=x, X=65, Time=0.000000001, r=.08,  
b=.08, sigma=.3)@price

I can then plot either

 > plot(x,c1, type="l")

or

 > plot(x,c2, type="l")

and get a decent plot.  But how do I create one plot with both  
lines?  Thanks for any help you can provide.

James


P.S.  I probably ought to ask this in a separate thread but what's  
the "proper" way of setting the Time such that the options are priced  
at expiration.  Setting time equal to 0 results in a price when the  
underlying is at the strike of N/A.  So as a kludge, I simply used  
Time=0.000000001.  Thanks

I think I figured it out.  I'm sorry to waste everyone's time.

That did the trick.

If there's a preferable way of creating this plot I wouldn't mind  
hearing it.  My question regarding setting Time to expiration still  
stands though.  Thank you.

This paper describes both doing brute-force numerical integration and 
using the carr-madan fft to compute vanilla prices.

Once you can price these vanillas under heston in R  then Calibration 
can be done with optim or any of the other packages.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] frontierMarkowitz problem: Tangential POrtfolio
Message-ID: <464DB3F8.5070800@slashworks.de>

Hi,

I am playing around with frontierMarkowitz
since I am interested in the tangetial portfolio.
Unfortenately frontierMarkowitz does not work properly with my own data.
i scan them with read.table,
make them a time series with ts.

The result looks fine, assetsStats shows results, so i think that my 
data are in the right format...

t.weights
[1] NA

Rm
[1] NA

Sm
[1] NA

All other output looks fine so far.

Does anyone has an idea, where the problem is?

You haven't really given us enough information to give you any feedback.

If your constraints are too restrictive, it is quite possible to fail to 
generate *any* portfolio that will meet your constraints.

Have you tried using portfolio.optim or even solve.QP directly?

Can you produce a portfolio using fewer assets?

Have you used debug() in R to examine the intermediary results inside 
the function?

etc...

mean-variance optimization is very sensitive to inputs and constraints. 
  Without information on those inputs and constraints, this list can't 
give you anything more than general guidance.

garchFit can take a very long time with a large series: long enough that 
I sometimes use it on a large fast server rather than on my laptop.

Have you tried with include.mean=FALSE ?  This will speed things up, and 
may let you know if you are on the right track, and it is worth letting 
the computer think for potentially a very long time.

Have you tried with a different algorithm? The algorithms have different 
performance characteristics.

Have you read the garch paper posted on the RMetrics website?
It has some additional suggestions on speeding the process.

Is there a way to display brackets 1sigma, 2sigma in combination with actual
values on the x scale in histogram plots or any other type of plots? I am
not quite sure how this would be accomplished but if its possible to squeeze
in the sigma brackets it would be great.

Thank you

There's a good example of such an overlay at:

http://zoonek2.free.fr/UNIX/48_R/03.html

Look for a chart called "Third moment (skewness)".  The example shows 
how to calculate dimensions and draw a vertical line segment overlaid 
on the histogram.  Although he isn't doing exactly what you're looking 
for, the code could be easily modified for your use.   

There's a lot of other good stuff there, as well.

Enjoy,

pcc

Is something like this what you are after?

There are very good examples on adding extra things to the standard 
histogram here:

http://zoonek2.free.fr/UNIX/48_R/03.html

and in the chart.Histogram function in package PerformanceAnalytics

Please share your results for others to benefit from.

Dear All,

I use get.hist.quote to read historical prices on various quotes from
Finance Yahoo. It works fine on daily prices and most of the time on monthly
prices but it is sometimes difficult to synchronize monthly data without
duplicating months when extracting more than one quote. 

Here is an example where many months are duplicated (see at the end of the
time series that 2006-05 is duplicated because CAC40 is quoted on 2006-05-02
and AXA on 2006-05-01):
x <- get.hist.quote("^FCHI", compression = "m", start = as.Date(0), quote =
"Close")
x <- cbind( xx, get.hist.quote("CS.PA", compression = "m", start =
as.Date(0), quote = "Close") )

For the moment, to avoid these problems, I use something like:
readFromYahooM <- function(nam,quote) {
 xx.0 <- get.hist.quote(nam, compression = "m", start = as.Date(0), quote =
quote)
 xx <- ts( coredata(xx.0), frequency = 12, start =
as.numeric(as.yearmon(as.Date(start(xx.0)[1]))) )
 xx
}
x <- readFromYahooM("^FCHI","Close")
x <- cbind(x, readFromYahooM("CS.PA","Close"))
colnames(x) <- c("FCHI","CS.PA")

It works, but there is a strong assumption that all the months are present
in the two time series and the fact is that xx is a zoo object and zoo
objects can contain irregular time series ! I am sure that there should be a
more elegant way to do a conversion from a zoo object to a ts object or to
replace the "start" parameter by the exact vector of zoo dates and or
yearmon but I don't find any way do to that.

I anyone can help me, I would appreciate.
Thanks in advance.

i solve the very same problem.

I usually do the whole data obtaining and preparation in ccapi2, i then 
export this data from ccapi2 as a CSV file which i load into R.

Data preparation includes for example aligning multiple timeseries, 
dealing with extreme outliers due to unreasonable trades.
For aligning multiple time series i use the java method alignTimeSeries 
viewable at 
http://activestocks.de:8081/viewrep/ccapi3/src/core/ccapi/core/util/TimeSeriesUtil.java?r=1.7#l44 


Would be good if RMetrics would integrate such a method. Yahoo does drop 
a few days in long timeseries, usually.

Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Ulrich Staudinger

Hi Ulrich,

Thanks for your answer and it surely helps. I didn't known about CCAPI and
SlimFX and both seem to be very interesting projects.

OK, there are some useful tools in this situation. Which you want to use 
depends what exactly what to end up with.

## obtain series
x <- get.hist.quote("^FCHI", compression = "m", start = as.Date(0),
   quote = "Close")
y <- get.hist.quote("CS.PA", compression = "m", start = as.Date(0),
   quote = "Close")

## merge based on "Date" time stamps (which might not match)
xy <- merge(x, y)

## remove NAs by averaging in each month
xy1 <- aggregate(xy, as.yearmon, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
## (which gives NaN rather NA for the first "y" observations)

## alternatively: first go to "yearmon" scale and then merge
x2 <- aggregate(x, as.yearmon, mean)
y2 <- aggregate(y, as.yearmon, mean)
xy2 <- merge(x2, y2)

## to convert to "ts", you can simply do
xy1ts <- as.ts(xy1)
xy2ts <- as.ts(xy2)

## Of course, you could also keep the merged series with "Date" time 
## stamp, e.g., using the first of the month
xy2d <- xy2
time(xy2d) <- as.Date(time(xy2))

I hope you can help me sending the paper and related materials or lead me to find the paper.

Thanks in advance.

Dear Sirs,
I think there is a little misunderstanding. In fact, as you can read in my first post I have already googled (I found the abstract), searched in website of papers (ex. IDEAS: Economic and Finance Research) and contacted the author (he say that don't have a copy and kindly summerize me the content of paper). R SIG FINANCE is the last resources for me to find the complete paper or the slide of talk.

Thanks a lot and excuse me for insistence.

Message-ID: <10903450.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear All;

I have searched the forum but couldn't find a similar problem. 
Currently I am working with a very large set of XML files and the date is
formatted something like that
(YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+TZD)

Ex: "2005-12-05T00:00:00+02:00"

Previously, I've tried chron and fCalendar but couldn't find a way to import
this data as a time object.

I think somehow, timeDate may handle it, i tried almost all variations
formats, but couldn't make it work.

Any help appreciated...

Regards

zoo allows you to specify the date format.

as for your XML format, the CRAN package 'XML'
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/XML.html
should allow you to parse your data into a format that is suitable for 
passing into zoo.

library(chron)
x <- "2005-12-05T00:00:00+02:00"
datetime <- chron(as.Date(x), substring(x, 12, 19))
sgn <- switch(substring(x, 20, 20), "+" = +1, "-" = -1)
offset <- as.numeric(times(paste(substring(x, 21), "00", sep = ":")))
datetime + sgn * offset

# or perhaps the last line should be:
datetime - sgn * offset

Here is one improvement.  The sgn line is changed to make the entire
calculation vectorized:

library(chron)
x <- "2005-12-05T00:00:00+02:00"
x <- c(x, x)
datetime <- chron(as.Date(x), substring(x, 12, 19))
sgn <- substring(x, 20, 20)
sgn <- (sgn == "+") - (sgn == "-")
offset <- as.numeric(times(paste(substring(x, 21), "00", sep = ":")))
# or should + be - in next line?
datetime + sgn * offset

Thanks Gabor, actually I  try to handle it as it is, but substring() solve
the problem, brilliantly...

These look fine to me -- and I could indeed run the 'IBM' example from the
help page after applying the change to a local copy of yahooImport().

Thanks for the patch,  Dirk

Hi Fabrice,

As a risk and performance analyst, I think that PerformanceAnalytics is a
must have, as it provides wrappers for many usefull functions for portfolio
risk management.

Hi,
 
I am a new user of R project!
 
As Risk and Performance Analyst, I would like to know the packages I must
download. Could somebody kindly tell me if R project is very easy and
appropriate in the risk measurement of mutual and hedge funds?
 
Thanks in advance!

One convenient way to do that is to build a R - TeX architecture. If your raw data is stored in a database you may build pdf reports for as many funds you want in just one click.

Thanks for your help!

R project will enable me to have CVaR, Modified Sharpe Ratio, etc. But, I guess that I cannot use R project to produce "automatically" Risk management report and performance attribution for the funds. Is it true? I will be happy to know
what software is appropriated for this task?

PS: I need to produce 500 risk management reports per month!!!

Thanks!

Fabrice

Giullaume is correct.  I'll provide a little more context.

The primary tool that you want is Sweave, which allows you to run R code 
from inside a LaTeX document.  This is straightforward, but I wouldn't 
call it simple if you're not familiar with LaTeX and as a newcomer to R.

I would recommend starting by choosing a LaTeX editor that can be used 
with Sweave, such as Lyx.  There are HOWTO's available online describing 
how to configure Lyx for use with Sweave.

Then, you'll construct your risk report.  Basically, I'd look at the 
charts and tables in the PerformanceAnalytics package for ideas on how 
you might build R functions to compile statistics you need for your 
report into tabular data and for charts that you may wish to display. 
Many of the charts and tables in PerformanceAnalytics may be appropriate 
starting places for your mutual fund reports because many of them were 
developed for analysis of portfolios of hedge funds. I also mention it 
because as one of the authors, I'm most familiar with it.

You'll probably want to use Lyx or some other LaTeX editor to help you 
lay out your Sweave document into a nice printable report structure.  As 
Guillaume mentioned, if your historical data is stored in a database, 
you can automate the task of loading the data and generating one report 
per fund.  If your historical data is in files or available via a web 
download interface, this could be automated also.  Ask the list if you 
run into specific problems on this that you are having trouble sorting 
through yourself.

Once you have a layout that works, running Sweave in an automated or 
semiautomated fashion for producing the reports is pretty 
straightforward.  There was an R News article specifically on this topic 
a while back that I'm sure a little Google searching could help you locate.

Hopefully this adds a little more context to Guillaume's suggestion. 
The list will be happy to help with specifics as you get closer.  Please 
consider sharing the LaTeX/noweb document that you develop with the 
community.  I'm sure others would benefit from your experience.

A didn't know about this Sweave pack and it is a really interesting topic.

Another simple way to produce the report would be to store the quantitative
results of your risk analysis in an Microsoft Access database (using the
excellent RODBC package) and to create as many Access Reports as you need.
It is less 'elegant' than what explains Brian, but it can be done easily and
it is very flexible.

The approach I take is somewhat similar. I am a big fan of PL/R (http://www.joeconway.com/plr/) which allows you to embed R code within SQL stored procedures in the Postgres database. This means I can do my analysis within the same database that stores our data. One can then use either R's charting packages or any other package that can talk to an ODBC datasource to make your charts.

Fabrice:

I am jumping into the middle of this thread but your issue of Performance
Attribution for Funds caught my attention.

Not sure what type of performance attribution you need
but you can do Style Analysis on funds And good results.

Suggest looking at William Sharpe's 19992 paper on Style Analysis.
If you web search you will find it.

In essence, and I am VERY new to R myself but:

You would want to build a factor model of return series
for each fund along with proxies such as S&P Industry Indexes
or FTSE sect/industry classes (this helps for international stuff).

>From what I can tell with R, there is Principal Components(PCA)
capability. Build a correlation matrix, decompose the matrix
via PCA or Single Value Decomposition(SVD) to get eigenvectors.

>From experience rotate them so they are orthogonal. That would be 
using a promax technique if R has such.

The last step is to load your factor model with an optimizer
with the benchmark, objective function, the fund itself and the
Tableau containing the underlying factors for the indices you use.

See the Sharpe Paper 1992, it's good explanation
but his categories for style analysis is not perfect.

Hope this helps as my first contribution to R threads
And being TOTALLY new to using R. 

from a former SPSS and IMSL programmer!
Neil

Hi Fabrice,

Not an issue, you can perfectly do that with R.

You can create a fully automated system with R. But, even if many libraries will simplify it, you will have to program a good part of the system yourself, at least for integration. This takes time and requires programming skills but will give you a lot of flexibility.

If (very high) speed is an issue, e.g. if you need to produce the 500 reports in half an hour, R may not be the tool of choice. But you can probably end up creating your 500 reports in one day...

Other people has mentioned Sweave for creating the reports. It's likely the best and fastest-generation tool, but I also use extensively R(D)COM to build a good number of Excel and Powerpoint reports on the fly.

Good luck,

Enrique

There are no free sources for individual fund returns.  All of the Fund 
databases are paid subscription services.  Research is hampered by the 
fact that none of the data providers are complete, and all the databases 
have different biases.  There are many academic papers on selection and 
sample bias in hedge fund databases that you may wish to review.

In general, the various hedge fund databases do publish their index data 
for free, but not the individual fund data. Since it looks like you are 
at a university, you *may* be able to get access to their data for a 
reduced rate (or maybe free if you inquire and are persistent) to use it 
in publications.

Here are some of the major hedge fund database/index providers:

Guillaume has mentioned HFR:
https://www.hedgefundresearch.com/
Their indexes are widely quoted.  Academic use of their database is 
available at reduced subscription rates.

There is also EDHEC:
http://www.edhec-risk.com/
I believe that EDHEC has the most authoritative Hedge Fund Indices 
because they publish a factor-based (PCA) meta-index of all/most of the 
published hedge fund data sources.  The EDHEC indices have the best 
correlations to actual fund data that I have reviewed.  EDHEC, as a 
semi-academic institution, is also very friendly about using their 
information in publication (they readily granted permission to 
distribute some of their data with PerformanceAnalytics for R, for example).

Morningstar/Altvest:
http://www.investorforce.com/av/index/index_rets.asp
Morningstar purchased Altvest a while back.  Their database used to be 
one of the least expensive.

CSFB/Tremont:
http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD
This database is one of the most complete.

MSCI/Barra:
http://www.mscibarra.com/products/indices/hf/
A relatively small database.

EurekaHedge:
http://www.eurekahedge.com/indices/hedgefundindices.asp

Barclays:
http://www.barclaygrp.com/indices/ghs/Hedge_Fund_Index.html
These are the Barclays index data.  I have seen academic papers 
utilizing fund return data from their database, so it may be worthwhile 
to inquire about academic use.

http://www.hedgefund-index.com/
Publishes some individual fund data (although not historical returns) 
licensed from Barclays as I recall.

There are a number of smaller players, but I think I've accurately 
covered the majority of the major databases and their published indexes.

Regards,

    - Brian

On the Sweave approach, here's a quick outline of possible times:

- Install and Configure Lyx editor to talk to R
1-2 hours

- modify the simple Sweave/Lyx examples to do something more interesting
1 hour

- build a report using existing functions,tables, and graphs with 
file-based data
1-2 days (assuming a Pertrac or Morningstar style report)

- database linkage
time will vary based on your data and database

- web download of data
time will vary, but usually ~1-2 hours to write and test new download 
function

- additional tables/graphs
time will vary based on what you need, obviously

If you need to give these times to your boss, double or triple them ;).

I'd recommend starting with analytical functions that are already 
written, as in PerformanceAnalytics or RMetrics.  Since you're just 
getting started with R, it probably makes sense to use other functions 
first before trying to modify them to fit your more specific requirements.

   - Brian

Hi all,
Every day I generate 300 report of 30 pages every one in PDF format,
using R to import data from a MySQL database and to generate graph and
compute a lot of indicator (about 15-20 minutes), then R automatically
saved graph in a folder and indicators in a MySQL table. So I generate
reports using php and FPDF php's library. Php extract from the folder
the graphs and from MySQL the indicators (about 10 minutes).
R run via CMD in the web server that have php, so every morning I have
only to click a button in my intranet.

I hope my information can be usefoul to your aim.
Regards,

There are a lot of Greeks in fOptions, part of RMetrics.

Could you be a little more specific on what approach you want to use to 
get to implied volatility?  There are several, and I know I've seen code 
pointers posted to this list on implied volatilities in the past, so you 
might want to search the list archives.  I'd be interested in a summary 
to the list of what your searching turns up, so that we could have a 
directed conversation about it.

Regards,

  - Brian

I think that the fOptions pack does that: GBSGreeks & GBSVolatility

notionalize?

If you are talking about the notional value of a conctact it's just
price * contract size, but sizes are specific to each contract.  you can
get this information from the exchanges or from BBG.

Whit:

Thanks for your quick response.
I tried doing this:

# of contracts x contract price x contractsize x underlying price of the
contract size (ie. 18,000 bushels at whatever amount).
                                          Contracts      Price     Quote
Units       Contract size        cents/per pound
	BOK7 Comdty	SOYBEAN OIL FUTR May07	200	          32.48
lbs.	cents/lb.	60,000.00	         .01 

  I am not sure if this is correct to get notional value?

Neil

Neil,

I think you might be multiplying the price in twice there. I would say its
num_contracts * contract_size * price_of_underlying

ie for Nymex Crude

value of N contracts = N * 1000 * $68

I believe you have it.
I always encourage the use of UNITS:

(# contracts) * (contract size = 60000 lbs/contract) * (price = 36.36
cents/lb) (0.01 dollars/cent) = dollars = the current worth of you
number of contracts. Notice that the units cancel appropriately. The DES
page in Bloomberg helps here.

Edmund:

Yeah we made mistake that prices on CBOT are in cents.
Thus for Corn data we pulled 374.5 we should have
Converted to cents  = 3.745.

Just an FYI for everyone to avoid my dotard mistake! :)
http://www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/cont_detail/0,3206,1272+17391,00.html
Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Oats
4 Digit Price Quote 
First 3 digits are cents per bu 
Fourth digit is 1/8 cent/bu 
Tick size is ? cent/bu 
7350 = $7.35/bushel 
7352 = $7.35?  
7354 = $7.35?  
7356 = $7.35?  
7360 = $7.36 
Soybean Oil = cents per lb. 
2679 = $0.2679/lb

Thanks David, appreciate it.

Have to remember it's in cents!

Thanks for the reply Sylvain and Brian,

I take it that GBSOption with b=0 is what I'm looking for. However, I'm confused by the results. As an example, let's take the 94.50 put on the Sep 2008 eurodollar contract, expiry 9/15/08. The price is 94.625 and (price) vol is 12.35%. So,

> GBSOption("p",94.625, 94.50, 458/365, .05507, 0, .12382)

Title:
 Black Scholes Option Valuation 

Call:
 GBSOption(TypeFlag = "p", S = 94.625, X = 94.5, Time = 458/365, 
     r = 0.05507, b = 0, sigma = 0.12382)

Parameters:
          Value:          
 TypeFlag p               
 S        94.625          
 X        94.5            
 Time     1.25479452054795
 r        0.05507         
 b        0

But the correct values (using Bloomberg) are:

Delta: -0.426371
Gamma: 0.499401
Vega: 0.022302
Theta: -0.000268
Rho: -0.277807

What am I doing wrong? 

Thank you,

Hi Robert,

I think that the fOptions pack does that: GBSGreeks & GBSVolatility

Hi,

Does anyone have R code to calculate implied vol and greeks of an option on an interest rate future (e.g., CME's eurodollar contract)?

Thanks,
Robert

Robert,

It seems unusual to me that a nearly at-the-money option with a year  
and a quarter left in it's life would only be worth $0.2215 according  
to Bloomberg.  I would double-check the calculations from Bloomberg.   
To me, they seem most suspect.  I'm wondering if you entered the time  
to expiration incorrectly on Bloomberg, because from the looks of the  
Gamma and Vega, it looks like you might have entered a shorter time.   
I hope this helps.  Let me know if you figure this out.

James

Hi James,

Thanks for the reply. The Bloomberg valuation and greeks are certainly correct. You seem to suggest that a price of 0.2215 for a long-dated, near-the-money expiry is somehow low. But the underlying is an interest rate future and the price here quoted is 22.15 ticks, or $553.75 per option (25$ tick value) on 1 million forward 3m libor deposit at 5.375 (100 - 94.625). Price vol (which here is the same as basis point rate vol) is 12.35% and a bp change in forward rate is worth 25$. Nothing unusual here. 

Robert

Top-quoting makes it quite confusing to read the message thread, and for 
future reference, is generally discouraged on this list.

S and X in GBSOption need to be in the same units as the price you want 
out on the other end.  I'm not at a computer with R on it, being the 
weekend, but I would suspect units confusion here.  If everything is in 
the same units, you should get a rational result.

Also without referring to the manual, isn't there a slightly different 
function for the Black Scholes calculation for an option on a futures 
contract, which is what your Eurodollar example is?

Regards,

    - Brian

Robert,

After rethinking the issue, I'm wondering if the sigma you're using  
needs to be adapted to the Eurodollar contract pricing convention,  
since the contracts are priced at a discount (100-94.625).  So the  
volatility is really 12.35% on 5.375 not 12.35% on 94.625.  I looked  
around and found a spreedsheet from NYU that appears to make this  
adjustment.

http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~igiddy/edoptprice.xls

Plugging your numbers into the calculation (L6) from the spreadsheet  
yields

0.12382 (100 - 94.625) / 94.625  =  0.00703336856

If I use that for my sigma within R, I get

 > GBSOption("p",94.625, 94.50, 458/360, .05507, 0, .00703336856)

Title:
Black Scholes Option Valuation

Call:
GBSOption(TypeFlag = "p", S = 94.625, X = 94.5, Time = 458/360,
      r = 0.05507, b = 0, sigma = 0.00703336856)

Parameters:
           Value:
TypeFlag p
S        94.625
X        94.5
Time     1.27222222222222
r        0.05507
b        0
sigma    0.00703336856

Option Price:
0.2246195

Description:
Sat Jun 16 10:16:19 2007

Much closer to the price you got from Bloomberg.  Unfortunately, I  
don't have much experience with interest rate options to confirm this  
adjustment.

The issue to your questions is:

1- What type of instruments do you trade? 
2- In terms of risk management are you looking to:
   a) Track a benchmark and weight positions according (Portfolio Optimization).
   B) Look at attribution by industries, sectors, primary factors as interest rates, etc(Style Analysis)?
   C) Stress test your positions?

R can provide a lot of the analytics you need. The data is another issue.

Yes Bloomberg is very helpful but expensive (approx $14K per year per seat).

Barra now owned by Morgan Stanley is more equity focused but has been
Doing some fixed instrument support.

Depending on answers to above questions, suggest as alternative to Barra
Look at Northfield Information Systems (think the site is http://www.northinfo.com)
They offer some fine risk analytics, the data needed and software.

Last, one of the some of the most difficult instruments to model and get data on
Are Credit Default Swaps (look at http://www.markit.com).

Interest Rate Swaps are also difficult to model and get data on. Might try looking 
At http://www.tradeweb.com


Last, if you want to maintain your own Security Master you will obviously
Need a Database Product such as SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase.

And one of your best sources to find needed products for data sources, applications is check out
Bob's Guide (http://www.bobsguide.com/).

You are definitely looking at mid to high 6 figure budget for a good
Risk reporting system, not including, developers.

Hope this helps...

Hi Neil,

Your post is very interesting and I didn't know about bobsguide, very
interesting too !

Do you think that a combination of the various data sources that you suggest
would be cheaper than Bloomberg, $14k/year ? And what about data providers
like Global Insight ?

Regards.

Sylvain:

Depends on how many seats you think you need for Bloomberg which
would most likely be a function of the number of Traders you have on the desk
And probably number of back office people and risk manager.

I don't know the pricing of Global Insight.

There is no one single source for data, most use
A combination of service providers.

What exactly, if you don't mind me asking, are you trading?

Last, another option, since starting a Hedge Fund is not cheap, despite
the "excitement" of potential enormous fees is jump starting
By using a Fund Administrator.

The advantage of that is you get portfolio accounting done for you, reconciliation
support, possible risk analytics etc.

You should find Fund Admin providers on Bob's Guide, there are a lot.
The two I know are GlobeOp and Citco.

Finally, depending on who you select for your PB (Prime Broker),
many give out good support tools. In fact PB's are in many ways
becoming software firms, that's why we see firms such as Morgan Stanley
buying former publically traded Barra.

Suggest to launch, pick your PB(s), see what they have to offer
And go from there. (example: Lehman has a reasonable risk analytic
product called Lehman Point, which would be provided if they were
your PB... this is NOT an endorsement  :)!

Regards,


Neil

Another poster has already given an opinion on the "from scratch" cost
including all data, etc.  I'll focus my remarks more on R, to try to
help you figure out what you may have the ability to build in-house and
what you may wish to source externally.

There is a way of reading this question "what database platform should
we use?".  the answer to the platform question is that R can connect to
all modern SQL databases.  To contain the cost, you may wish to consider
MySQL, but any of the major commercial database engines would work as well.

Your question may also be read "what type of data do we need to store,
and what type of data model?"  This interpretation of your question is
more complex.

Clearly, you need instrument reference data, and historical
price/valuation data.  I would suggest that you develop your model data
fields (loosely) based on your input data.  Clearly, you need a place to
store any data that is relevant to your analysis.


> Bloomberg data, Bara data, Datastream, etc. 

I assume that you will already have subscriptions to this data.

There is a package RBloomberg, for getting data from Bloomberg, and
several discussions in the list archive here about using it.

For Barra data and Datastream, your approach will depend on how you get
the data.  Do you have a custom application and need to export it?  Is
it web page data with a login and password?  For data from subscription
websites, you could use get.hist.quote or curl to download the data
directly to R, or you could use some other language ranging from PHP to
Visual Basic to get the data and put it directly in your data model.

The data itself will be reformatted for access in your functions.  You
will download the data you need, and probably store it in your data model.

R can access the database, and can use RBloomberg or curl or
get.hist.quote-style download mechanisms to access the data from your
data sources.

I hope this helps your thinking.

Hi Fabrice

It depends if you mean to store the data you use in a proprietary databse or not. If not, I would recommend Bloomberg (although it clearly is expensive) as it is the only source you can directly connect to R (with RBloomberg). I never saw
any equivalent with Datastream or Barra.
Yet, I would follow Brian and recommend you to create your own database (which may potentially use several sources) and work from this point R (using the RODBC package): not only the odds are it will be much cheaper but it will also be much
faster...

Dear Fabrice, (are you french?)

I also begin to have a look at R, as i am working in a management company
specializing in Securitization. From what i have seen, R is not meant to
parse/integrate directly from a data provider. But such feed like Bloomberg
provide convenient API that should be quiet easily to glue with R with few
lines of scripting languages (we attack the Bloomberg database with a small
perl app in our company).

Regards,



"Dear Experts,I come back to you for one question. We decided to use R Project
for our risk management (reporting) system. Because, our funds use derivative
instruments, we will need to use many packages such as 'Performance Analytics
Package' 'VaR package' 'fOptions package', etc.So, my question is what type of
database we will need? Bloomberg data, Bara data, Datastream, etc. Other point:
Is the system (R) is able to use these principal sources of data? This problem
is very important in order to have a good estimation of the final cost of the
system! I will be happy to have your opinions about this point.Thanks!Fabrice"

One question I have for you is whether or not the data pulling has to be
done in real time.

Right now I'm using R on data that was originally pulled from FactSet
and Bloomberg but first placed into Excel spread sheets.  The data
processing (stats calculations) are only done once a month so how the
data is actually pulled (which is done by other people) is not too much
of a concern to me at this time.

However, there are ways to mix R with other languages.  Take a look at
the lists of R packages.  You can integrate R with MS Tools (Excel,
Access), C, C++, Java, etc.  You just need to download the relevant
packages.

Thanks.

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Looking for short-term consulting
Message-ID: <46801385.2030902@vanderbilt.edu>

Hello list,

I'm inquiring about short-term consulting over the next 3 weeks. For 
those of you in a dire need and can swing a plane ticket and room and 
board, I'd be willing to work on-site. I have what I call a typical 
UNIX/Web programmer skill set: C, Perl, Ruby, MySQL, PHP, plus R and 
embedding R with the littler and RApache projects, and I'm a CRAN 
package author of brew and co-author of Cairo.

E-mail me off-list if there are any takers. Also, you can learn more
about me from the url below.

Thanks,

Jeff
