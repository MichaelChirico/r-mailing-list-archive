Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] dccfit (RMGARCH): using uGARCHmultifit
Message-ID: <000d01d6b33f$972eb320$c58c1960$@gmail.com>

Anyone tried the function input uGARCHmultifit of the dccfit function from rmgarch? If so can you provide an example of how you used it and how to setup the uGARCHmultifit object? I can't figure it out.

According to the documentation <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rmgarch/versions/1.3-7/topics/dccfit-methods>  it should be possible to use the fit argument in dccfit where

*	" fit: (A previously estimated univariate '>uGARCHmultifit object (see details)."

I'd like to input my fits of several GARCH models directly into the final DCC estimation because the GARCH models where difficult to estimate (I used several optimizers).

Thanks Alexios for providing me references to examples. However, I?m not able to add a fit to the multifit object. How can I do this? See example below

 

library(rmgarch)

library(parallel)

data(dji30retw)

Dat = dji30retw[, 1:10, drop = FALSE]

 

# Ten-asset example from http://www.unstarched.net/2013/01/03/the-garch-dcc-model-and-2-stage-dccmvt-estimation/

 

# (1) Replicate example

xspec = ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1)), variance.model = list(garchOrder = c(1,1), model = 'sGARCH'), distribution.model = 'norm')

uspec = multispec(replicate(10, xspec))

spec1 = dccspec(uspec = uspec, dccOrder = c(1, 1), distribution = 'mvnorm')

 

cl = makePSOCKcluster(10)

multf = multifit(uspec, Dat, cluster = cl)

multf at fit

 

fit1 = dccfit(spec1, data = Dat, fit.control = list(eval.se = TRUE), fit = multf, cluster = cl)

fit1 at mfit$matcoef

 

# (2) subset of 9 assets. 

uspec9 = multispec(replicate(9, xspec))

cl9 = makePSOCKcluster(9)

multf9 = multifit(uspec9, Dat[,1:9], cluster = cl9)

multf9 at fit

 

# (3) Suppose we want to add an additional fit (imagine it was hard to estimate)

fit10 <- ugarchfit(spec=xspec,data=Dat[,10],solver.control=list(trace=0))

 

multf10 <- multf9

multf10 at fit[[10]] <- fit10   # to be used in  dccfit(spec10, data = cbind(Dat[,1:9],Dat[,10]), fit.control = list(eval.se = TRUE), fit = multf10, cluster = cl)

 

## the last line does not seem to work: 

# Error in `colnames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = asset.names) 

#   attempt to set 'colnames' on an object with less than two dimensions

 

Thanks, Lasse

 Hedging Systems
Message-ID: <CALj2E8XfwafQKyArcbHpBWMV9+u-2tALPAgrQrf2Zni_qZifhA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In quantstrat, as described in package documentation, orders turn into
transactions,  transactions turn into positions, positions turn into
trades. And the underlying logic of how you define a position (using
netting or hedging system) or a trade (flat-to-flat or FIFO etc)
significantly affects the mechanics of money management rules (stop loss
etc) and trade statistics (profit factor etc).

For defining positions, the netting vs hedging systems are defined as
follows:
https://www.metatrader5.com/en/mobile-trading/iphone/help/trade/general_concept

The original implementation of quantstrat is based on a netting system
where after having a long position, each additional long trade increases
the current position amount (unless you have a position limit) and the
stop-loss/take profit is applied to the total position as a whole and not
to the individual long trades separately.

My question is that is there a way to apply stop loss and take profit to
each opened trade independently, regardless of order side (long or short)
and previous positions? If yes, would you provide an example of it?

Best regards
Ayhan

Ayhan,

If I'm understanding correctly:

Are you familiar with order sets?

By defining a stop loss that works on a particular parent rule, that
should do the trick.

See this post:

Ilya thanks for your reply, your help is much appreciated

Yes I am familiar with ordersets and orderchains, but my question is
related to how stop loss is applied to each trade

Below I put a minimal example of a strategy where we only open long trades
with a size of 100 lots using moving average crossover, and we have a stop
loss with a threshold of 0.001.

After running the strategy on GBPUSD data, please have a look at the 3rd,
4th and 5 th transactions. In these transactions, the strategy first have a
long trade with  100 lot, then another long trade with 100 lot (so now our
position is 200 lots), and then the stop loss rule is executed and the
whole 200 lots will be closed, which means that the stop loss rule is based
on the whole position that we have.

Every time the strategy adds new long positions to the existing ones (like
pyramiding), the stop loss rule is executed on the whole position and
position is always flattened.

My question is that is there a way to apply the stop loss rule
**seperately** for each of the 100 lot trades, which may have different
cost basis, so may have different stop loss prices? In this case, for
instance, each stop loss will be executed independently and each stop loss
transaction will have a size of -100 lots.

Regards
Ayhan

Look at your stoploss rule and the orderqty it calls for. You actively
specify orderqty = 'all'. That means to flatten the entire position.

As far as a stop loss on a partial position, in your particular case, you
can simply set that with a better specified orderqty argument by specifying
100 lots instead of 'all'.

Message-ID: <9d93eb08-02ab-2de6-4f72-4c0cc62c0bf8@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I want to calculate annualized log return for a security. But the issue 
is that the company follows financial year from April to March. So, all 
its other ratios are calculated from April to March year. The data is 
taken using the package tidyquant.

library(tidyquant)

df<- tq_get("SBIN.NS")

 From the package vignette of tidyquant, the periodReturn can be 
calculated for yearly, but in that case the year is calendar year. But I 
want to get the return for financial year. In case of this company, the 
financial year is from April to March. So, what modifications do I need 
to make in order to calculate annual log return from April to March?

Thanks in advance,

Maulik.

I don't use tidyquant, but you can easily use endpoints() in xts to get
the end of March timestamps and calculate your period return that way.

One more question to solve my case

We can access the parent rule?s order price using chain.price argument  in
rule functions.

Is it also possible to access parent rule?s order size as well? I searched
but couldn't find it

Assume that the parent order may take variable position size for each
trade. It takes one long position and then adds a second long position
before hitting the stop loss for the first one. After that the stop loss
for the first position is hit. We need to know the position size of the
first trade in writing stop loss rule. Is it possible to access the
position size of the parent rule?

Thanks for your help
Regards

The chained order quantity isn't directly passed to the triggered chain
rule right now.

Rules have access to the full current state, since they are path
dependent.  

So, you have two options here.  You can either?

- write a custom order sizing function that queries the order status to
check the chained rule and order to get the quantity

- propose a patch/pull request to rules.R and ruleSignal.R that could
process a chain.qty optional argument

see the code in rules.R to see how we pass chain.price, and it should
inform how you would take either of the above approaches.

Regards,

Brian

 Quantstrat
Message-ID: <CAMDYzbs8yneG9b2aWVgTSHnKUR_-nCFORyhtSarGZBnzsagLvg@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any other way to instruct R to take half position size at first TP
and move the new SL to breakeven?

I currently take 2 runs to do this.

First run: with SL and 1st TP
Second run: with SL and no TP (Closes when indicators give signal)


Afterwhich, I merge the results of both runs.

Would appreciate some reference to achieve this.

Position size is not fixed but based on ATR (package: IKTrading)

 likelihood of a Copula-GARCH model
Message-ID: <CAGyYUSqPbKn=5rYDMyDHDkcip=KLJKSae1ejCsxjwxAg=E0_Yg@mail.gmail.com>

I cannot reconcile the log-likelihood of a Copula-GARCH model.
Below is a simple example where the marginal volatilities are constant (for
which I use iGARCH with beta1 = 1) and have Normal distribution; and the
copula is constant and Gaussian. In short, the model is that of
returns having multivariate Normal distribution with constant parameters.
I compare the likelihood from cgarchfit (= 5890.564) with the likelihood
using the multinormal density, with both mean and covariance taken from
cgarchfit (= 5896.262). They should be the same.

Any help understanding why I cannot reconcile this will be much
appreciated!

Hi all,
I?m using IBrokers package from GITHUB ("joshuaulrich/IBrokers")

I?ve found in the code this line that BLOCKs every snapshot data request.

??????????????????????????
if(snapshot == "1") {
   stop("Snapshot not working (?)?)
??????????????????????????

Is there a reason for that?

Removing this line the snapshot requests works for me?.

Thanks for your help.

Can you give me an example of a snapshot request that works for you
when you remove the stop()?

Thanks,

Hi Josh,

Thanks for you answer? :-)

I?ve an IB account for NYMEX futures and snapshot requests works for all instruments:

ex.
fut = twsFUT(symbol="NQ", exch="GLOBEX", expiry="202012")
snapshot = reqMktData_modified(tws, fut, snapshot=TRUE)

If I select others markets or instruments (where I don?t have real time data):

reqMktDataType(tws, 3)
fut = twsFUT("KC", exch="NYBOT", expiry="202103")
snapshot = reqMktData_modified(tws, fut, snapshot=TRUE)

But I have to change ticker mapping:

I know that real IB "Snapshot Market Data" service (0.03 cents per request) works just for the following instruments (does not exists for ICE/NYBOT):

https://ibkr.info/article/2830 <https://ibkr.info/article/2830>

??????????

I?ve found that updatePortfolio doesn?t work with my TWS and I?ve remapped the following tickers:

    portfolioValue = list()
    portfolioValue$position = as.numeric(msg[13])
    portfolioValue$marketPrice = as.numeric(msg[14])
    portfolioValue$marketValue = as.numeric(msg[15])
    portfolioValue$averageCost = as.numeric(msg[16])
    portfolioValue$unrealizedPNL = as.numeric(msg[17])
    portfolioValue$realizedPNL = as.numeric(msg[18])
    portfolioValue$accountName = msg[19]

I?m not sure that?s the right way to fix the problem or not?
Let me know if I?m wrong.

Thanks for your help!

Regards

Diego

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] EDGAR filing data and corporate actions
Message-ID: <b5c8a12f-1e35-04be-7d2a-6097e8b3f28e@meddatainc.com>

I would like to begin analyzing corporate filings from SEC and also have a need for information on corporate actions such as splits, dividends, ex-dividend dates etc etc. I already have stock price information (but not number of shares outstanding etc.) from another source.

Googling I found the edgar package which allows me to retrieve various information from the EDGAR database given the CIK for a company. One of the functions take a partial company name as an alternative to CIK but I have yet to find a function which takes a partial company name and retrieves any number of CIK numbers for that entity, as well as previous company names etc. Does such a function exist in edgar? Or perhaps in another package? The alternative would be to do this manually on the SEC website but I would rather automate it.

Second, it seems Yahoo Finance has some corporate action data but I did not see that I could retrieve eg ex-dividend dates. Is this possible? Or are there other, better sources that are either free or can be used for a certain number of API calls/day?

Thanks!

Just stumbled across edgarWebR which seems to address the CIK issue etc.

Hi all,
I am a totally blind R user. Few days ago I got to know about the
Binancer package. This package solved one of the biggest issues I was
facing while learning about trading on Binance. The problem of how a
blind user can view candle stick charts to make trading decisions.
The functions in Binancer packaged allowed me to download candle stick
charts and order book in R environment from Binance. After downloading
I used write.CSV function to read data in Microsoft Excel. It has
significantly improved things for me.
 I?d like to say that R in general and in this case Binancer package
has many time made possible those things which were otherwise not
possible for me as a blind  computer user.
Now to my questions. Is there a function in Binancer package that I
have not found yet that allows me to download information of technical
indicators like RSI and other indicators? If Binancer does not have
this feature currently then are there any other R packages that will
help me in downloading the information about technical indicators from
crypto   currency exchanges to R environment.
One last question is there any R package that supports the BitMax
exchange? I think there is a package that supports BitMex exchange but
I have not come across a package that supports BitMax.
If currently it is not possible to download technical indicators from
exchanges then I do hope that if any package developer is reading this
email will consider bringing this functionality to R as blind users
will like me will really benefit from it.

Regards,
Faiz.
PS I sent this email to R-help list and I was advised to send this
mail to this group. I was also told to Google RSI and find R packages.
But I am not sure I found what I was hoping to find. A  simple
function like Binance_depth to get  information of several indicators
such as RSI, moving averages and so on.

I recommend that you calculate indicator values yourself.  If you
download them, you will be limited to parameter values provided by the
data provider.  You can calculate all the popular indicators with
functions in the TTR package.

I'm the author of TTR, and maintain quantmod, xts, and some other
packages.  I'm interested in what I can do to help make those packages
more accessible to users with sight impairments.  Please email me
directly, since that is off-topic for this list.

Best,
Josh
