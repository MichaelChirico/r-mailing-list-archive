Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] parallel rugarch run
Message-ID: <CAOTSzf=g6zSBhVcdnLYkf00iRtGWq1me1941ue3Yu3zEv+dALA@mail.gmail.com>

I implemented a parallel rugarch script by looping over 4 input parameters
and writing some output into two files for optimal AIC and BIC,
respectively. My PC has 4 cores.
I write output when the new AIC or BIC are  more negative than the current
ones (see the snippet below).  But now my question is: can the
parallel sessions be confused about which AIC/BIC are current? And could
ihtis implementation miss some parameter combos?
Thank you, Alec

result <- foreach(ka = ka0:kaa, .packages = 'rugarch')  %:%
  foreach(kb = kb0:kbb) %:%
  foreach(km = km0:kmm) %:%
  foreach(kn = kn0:knn) %dopar% {


#    print(c(ka, kb, km, kn))
    GARCHspec <- ugarchspec( variance.model = list(model = garchType,
garchOrder = c(km, kn)),
                             mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(ka, kb),
include.mean = TRUE),
                             distribution.model = dist)


    #fit
    aic <- infocriteria(fit)[1]  #AIC
    bic <- infocriteria(fit)[2]  #BIC
    if(aic < currAIC) {
      currAIC <- aic
      ka_aic <- ka
      kb_aic <-kb
      km_aic <- km
      kn_aic <- kn
      aic_sigma <- sigma(fit)[L]
      msg <- sprintf("%d %d %d %d %.3E %.3E\n",
                      ka, kb, km, kn, currAIC, aic_sigma)
      cat(msg, file = aic_garch_outfile, append = TRUE, sep=',')

    }
    if(bic < currBIC) {
      currBIC <- bic
      ka_bic <- ka
      kb_bic <-kb
      km_bic <- km
      kn_bic <- kn
      bic_sigma <- sigma(fit)[L]
      msg <- sprintf("%d %d %d %d %.3E %.3E\n",
                    ka, kb, km, kn, currBIC, bic_sigma)
      cat(msg, file = bic_garch_outfile, append = TRUE, sep=',')

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Rblpapi and Bloomberg Query Language support
Message-ID: <CABXq32vAYsmVP3zeC+R4zLthCeCbxJvqWV2hXwqknDoL15pvfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Happy New Year!

Could you please clarify whether the Rblpapi library supports the use of
Bloomberg Query Language (BQL)?

In particular, I would like to understand whether BQL queries can be
executed via Rblpapi, or if the functionality is limited to standard
Bloomberg API requests.

Many thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Oleg

Questions for a particular package are frequently handled directly at the
package repository. For Rblpapi wwe can search GitHub Issues where, when
searching for the unique-enough string 'BQL' one finds one issue raised under
open queries:

  https://github.com/Rblp/Rblpapi/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20bql

and three more (one clearly pertinent) under closed issues:

  https://github.com/Rblp/Rblpapi/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20bql

In short, and now speaking for the package: No, someone would have to write
BQL support into the package first. I have not looked at the API for it.

Hope this helps, regards,  Dirk

The Bloomberg API does not expose access to BQL. So there is no way to add
it, and beyond the Excel interface the only other officially supported
programmatic access is via Bloomberg's proprietary BQuant python solution.

Regards,
David

Hello,

Would there be a Darvas Box library (or function) available for download?

TIA,
