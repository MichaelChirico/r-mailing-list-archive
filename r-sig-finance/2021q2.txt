For company fundamental data, in years past I used the S&P Compustat
XpressFeed product, and was pretty happy with it.  It had all filings,
plus daily prices and other ancillary data, arranged in a sane SQL
schema, loadable into either Oracle or MS SQL Server (using their
Windows C# XpressFeed Loader app, later converted to Java).  It was
expensive, but if you're willing to pay, it's likely still a good
choice today.

Since we had Compustat, I never tried parsing data myself from Edgar
or wherever else.  But of course if all you really want are dates of
earnings announcements and dividends, it wouldn't make sense to pay
for a full-featured product Compustat.

H,

The software product AAII Stock Investor Pro has this information.

If one really wants the raw data (and not use the GUI), then one can get this information directly from the .dbf files on disk.  These .dbf (Foxpro) files can be opened and read-in using Libre Office Calc. 16 GBs of RAM, in my case, seems to be needed, to read the big .dbf files.  This memory requirement seems to be a challenge of Libre Office.

Alternately, and simply, the .dbf file data can be read in through the base R package foreign?, function read.dbf,? into R data.frames, with only a small amount of computer memory.

The .dbf file reading code is by Frank Warmerdam in both cases: Calc and read.dbf.

The software, product AAII Stock Investor Pro is updated daily.  In the past, it was updated from weekly then from monthly.  It requires a yearly subscription.  The product is much much much less expensive than Compustat (but does not have as much), but may have just-as-much, as you need.

I have taken a very first look at parsing EDGAR filings in XML format and XBRL but let's say I want to begin by finding out past and upcoming ex-dividend dates, dividends, split announcements and splits - I am not sure how I could "easily" retrieve those in an automated fashion. Next item of interest would be company announcements of other types of upcoming key events.

It is of course possible that the above items are announced in various press releases which would require reading those manually.

I do not know where eg Compustat gets its information but I am not looking for a commercial product. Yahoo lists some of these items such as ex-dividend dates, dividends, splits, not sure where they get the information.

Thank you, will keep that product in mind. My first choice would be to see if it is in EDGAR though.

OK, looks like the XBRL taxonomy includes various corporate actions such as eg stock splits, see https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/xbrl-us-provides-taxonomy-for-corporate-actions.

Hi: I'm not absolutely certain if it has what you need but, if you are a
student, you might be able to get access to
crisp data for free.  It stands for center for research in security pricing
and has some connection to the university of chicago.
They sell ( or atleast used to )-provide lots of data on pricing and
corporate actions. I don't know the current status of it but it
might be worth looking into.

CRSP is still the gold standard in daily data, including corporate
actions and most fundamentals (with the paired Compustat database). ?It
is typically accessed via WRDS. ?It's not cheap, so Mark's suggestion
of university access is probably among the best. ?

For paid sources, something like Factset is probably much cheaper than
CRSP/Compustat/WRDS.

For free data, I don't really think there are any 'best' sources. ?All
the data is public, but the collation of that data into a easily parsed
dataset is not.

Regards,

Brian

I don't know how quickly this database is updated and therefore the delay but if possible i would like to use a primary source rather than a secondary source. It might be that parsing XBRL information from SEC EDGAR filings is workable - too early to tell.

Not all EDGAR filings need to be electronic, depending on the size of
the company. ?

CRSP is not timely. ?A commercial service like Factset or similar will
have everything a few seconds to a few minutes after it is announced.
EDGAR is slower.

Noted and I am only interested in companies listed on one of the exchanges. That begs the question where Factset and similar get their information: from company press releases? Do they not need to be posted "simultaneously" to SEC EDGAR if they contain major information? What is the "legally acceptable" delay for sharing the information with EDGAR?

Message-ID: <YGsCeHoFwvnZOew4@local>

I use chart_Series for plotting. add_TA adds an indicator with line
chart.

Can I use add_TA also for plotting an indicator as histogram or
rectangle boxes like add_Vo?

I tried add_TA's parameter taType with 'h' or 'b' without success.

plot.xts was based on chart_Series, so adding panels with plot.xts
should work.

Also, you can absolutely use 'h' plots with add_TA. ?See e.g.
chart.Posn in the blotter package:

And here's a simple example

getSymbols("SPY")
chart_Series(SPY, subset = "2021")
add_TA(Vo(SPY), type = "h")

You can get better help if you create a minimal reproducible example
of your problem.

It seems that additional params to add_TA are passed to plot. So I
can refer to the plot manual. I wasn't aware of that.

> of your problem.

Generally I'm aware of that. But I was looking for a feature, not
hunting a bug. So I didn't know how I could provide a minimal
reproducible here. But now I have:

getSymbols("SPY")
chart_Series(SPY, subset = "2021")
add_TA(ATR(SPY,10)[,"atr"], type="h")	# That's what I was looking for
add_TA(ATR(SPY,10)[,"atr"])		# instead of that

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Forward Curve Fitting
Message-ID: <CABXq32vDqs_TbnZu6R7jiCS4TniQ_uwVrUqvmZ4Ub_37dtRnhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

Maybe someone can help me with the below.

What would be the best way to fit the BTC/USD forward curve?

It is quite agile (including its shape).

Please see attached example: Deribit's market data, including futures and
options (from put-call parity), 24 cutoffs, one per hour, the most recent
(blue line) goes with bid/ask-s. Mobility of the curve in this sample is
not so bad TBH (can be much worse).

The Nelson-Siegel and Svensson models didn't work for me (maybe I didn't
use them properly?).

I'm ready to give up and fit it with splines but maybe somebody knows a
better way?

Oleg

Message-ID: <8E86E4D3-B21B-406B-A855-EE1A33A3EF51@contoso.com>

Dear all,

In line of research conducted by 2 colleagues and me for our thesis this year, we want to examine ?the importance higher moments: skewness and kurtosis of returns for VaR and cVaR estimation using GARCH for European Blue chips?.

First of all, we would like to thank Alexios Ghalanos for the package Rugarch, which is quite impressive and nice to use and Kris Boudt for explaining it on Datacamp. Some things we would like to examine further, that is: the method of implementing SGT density distribution for GARCH models. I know that there is the r package SGT. But the practical way of implementing it in R with GARCH models, does not seem clear to us at this point in time.

We look forward hearing from you. This is the first time I used the R-SIG-Finance list, so any comments are welcome for improvement.

Best regards,
Enjo Faes

Enjo,

I'm more than willing to be corrected on these matters, but if I were 
you, I would immediately see moving forward in one of three ways: two of 
which are technically easy but not what you want per se, and the other 
is conceptually easy but is exactly what you want.

The technically easy thing to do would be to use the generalized 
hyperbolic skew t student distribution or the skewed generalized error 
distribution, both of which may capture the dynamics you are interested 
in. The Skewed generalized error distribution is the limiting case of 
the skewed generalized t distribution.

The alternative, which will give you exactly the amount of fine grained 
control you want but will take a bit more work, is to implement the 
maximum likelihood estimation yourself. What this (usually) means is 
that you have a parameter vector ? (this would include the parameters of 
your mean equation, the parameters of your volatility equation, and all 
of the parameters of the conditional distribution) that when given that 
vector, we know what standardized residuals that implies. We can then 
"score" the standardized residuals based on how they compare to what we 
have assumed the conditional distribution is, and pick the highest 
score. The canonical way of doing this is to take the (negative) log 
transformation of the likelihood and then maximize (minimize) it as a 
function of that parameter vector. Presumably the SGT package could be 
helpful with this somehow.

The above approach is something of a pain but it's a good way to get 
into the code yourself, and I did it for an undergraduate thesis myself 
a few years ago when I implemented a non-supported GARCH model. However, 
I note that this is not the point of your paper, so you may be unwilling 
to do that.

Anyone else should feel free to chime in if I've said anything wrong, 
missed anything in the rugarch documentation, or have generally made a 
fool of myself.

Best,

Alex

Dear all,
I would have a question about?fiGarch(p,d,q) estmation in the useful?rugarch package. Is it possible to get an estimate of parameter value d ? If not, what the estimate "delta" stand for in the estimation reults ?
Best Regards,

Hi Ole and Alexios,

Am sorry to be sending another email about the same issue. I thought
attaching the data i am using could be helpful.


I kindly request for your assistance with rvine code under the following
heading:

When i use the code in R i get error messages.


 My data file sent to your inbox has 5 indices and when i replace 20 with 5
in the code, i still get error messages. I have attached both [the data and
code]. Help me and adjust the code so that i can adapt it to my dataset.




Kind regards

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] ACD vs GARCH
Message-ID: <108E534D-79AA-417B-96F9-B4B3A86A63D7@hotmail.com>

Dear all,

In the light of the research with two fellow colleagues, we are already making a lot of progress thanks to the last very detailed answer by Alex Garland.

  1.  We did a brief analysis already with over 100 Garch models (8 volatility models, 5 conditional distributions: norm, sstd, std, ged, sged & various arma orders) estimated via rugarch by Alexios Galanos and comparing them using AIC.
  2.  From visualizing the models we observed the general trend that for all models the skewed student?s t-distribution is the ?best? conditional density (lowest AIC) for all GARCH models tested.
  3.  We then did a moving window approach using the ugarchroll. Which works perfectly.
  4.  As an extension of our analysis we wanted to compare the garch models with time varying higher moments using the racd package. Although there is already a lot of literature there in the past decades and I must say the documentation about this is already very helpful on unstarched and the vignette, but I cannot figure out why there is never convergence using the skewed student?s t (see indicated warning).
     *   I followed Bali et al. (2008) ?In this paper, we adopt the conditional density approach initiated by Hansen (1994) and extended by Jondeau and Rockinger (2003) to model the conditional high-order moment parameters of the SGT density as follows:
[cid:image001.png at 01D75219.D9E013C0]
where lambdat is the unrestricted skewness parameter (sometimes referred to as ?xi?) and etat and kappat are the unrestricted kurtosis parameters.
     *   So I would think this is basically using the ?pwl? for the skew and shape order as in the documentation of racd is stated: ?Jondeau and Rockinger (2003) used, among other tested parameterizations, first order piecewise linear dynamic?.
Below is my code

spec = racd::acdspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 0)), variance.model = list(variance.targeting = FALSE),distribution.model = list(model = 'sstd', skewOrder = c(1, 1, 1), shapeOrder = c(1,1,1), skewmodel = 'pwl', shapemodel = 'pwl'))

cl = makePSOCKcluster(10)
rollacd = racd::acdroll(sGARCH_ACDspec, data = R, n.start = 2500, refit.every = 500,refit.window = "moving", solver = "hybrid", calculate.VaR = TRUE, VaR.alpha = 0.05, cluster = cl, fit.control = list(), solver.control = list())
stopCluster(cl)

It might have something to do with the distribution ?sstd? because ?jsu? for example works very well and extremely fast. But still is there a way to solve this for the ?sstd?? I always get ?non-converged estimation windows present...resubsmit object with different solver parameters...? Tried the resume() command with another solver, change the tolerance inside of the solver.control list, change the window sizes, other suggestions?

Looking forward hearing from you,
Best,
Enjo

Dear all,
Is there a package that allows to plot the Cumulative IRF for garch models ? Rugarch packages?does not.
Thank you in advance.

 incorrect.
Message-ID: <CA+oJuEEv+fDCsArmXo1ciKvsQPs9mOYfqAEiUkeZ=g3o+1oogA@mail.gmail.com>

So, I'm trying to replicate Return.portfolio, since I intend to port it
over into Python, and while I understand most of the calculations, there's
one thing that bugs me, namely contribution. Here's my MRE:

getSymbols(c('SPY', 'TLT'), from = '1990-01-01')

R = na.omit(cbind(Return.calculate(Ad(SPY)), Return.calculate(Ad(TLT))))
R_na <- cbind(Return.calculate(Ad(SPY)), Return.calculate(Ad(TLT)))

out <- Return.portfolio(R = R,
                        weights = c(1, .6), verbose = TRUE, rebalance_on =
NA, contribution = FALSE)

r_calc <- cbind(R, 0)
cumprods <- cumprod(1+r_calc)

# EOP.Value
eop.value <- cumprods * matrix(rep(c(1, .6, -.6), nrow(tmp)), ncol = 3,
byrow = TRUE)
print(tail(round(eop.value-out$EOP.Value), 6))


# BOP.Value
bop.value <- eop.value/(1+r_calc)
print(tail(round(bop.value-out$BOP.Value), 6))


# EOP.Weight
eop.weight <- eop.value/rowSums(eop.value)
print(tail(round(eop.weight-out$EOP.Weight), 6))

# BOP.Weight
bop.weight <- bop.value/rowSums(bop.value)
print(tail(round(bop.weight-out$BOP.Weight), 6))

In all cases, everything matches up besides the contributions. When I
implement what's defined in the functionality, namely:

contribution: The per period contribution to portfolio return of each
asset. Contribution is calculated as BOP weight times the period's return
divided by BOP value. Period contributions are summed across the individual
assets to calculate portfolio return

So, contribution should be:

contrib <- bop.weight*r_calc/bop.value

Which gives me the following result:

tail(contrib)

            SPY.Adjusted  TLT.Adjusted X0
2021-06-07 -1.200836e-04 -0.0003804248  0

2021-06-14  2.750417e-04 -0.0009408983  0

Yet, the *actual* contribution, as defined by Return.portfolio, is:

 tail(out$contribution)
            SPY.Adjusted  TLT.Adjusted Residual
2021-06-07 -0.0008054887 -0.0007500412        0

2021-06-14  0.0018523718 -0.0018870209        0

Which clearly does not match.

Is the documentation incorrect, or am I misunderstanding something?

Hey Ilya,
I go over the Return.portfolio() calculations by hand in my online computational finance book (see https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introcompfinr/portfolios-and-portfolio-returns.html ). This might help you find out where you are going wrong with your calculations below. 
Cheers,
Eric
