Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Finding stock splits and dividend information
Message-ID: <e0b51cee-6914-54b9-cf32-ac5018f64abb@meddatainc.com>

Can anyone suggest a source for stock splits and dividend information on US listed stocks? I already have the quotes but in order to do fundamental analysis using historical information the two items above are required. I am looking to go back to ca 2010 (or earlier, if possible).

I have looked into parsing XBRL information from the SEC (8-K filings as I understand it) but it does not seem promising for two reasons: (1) XBRL has a short history, shorter the smaller the company is; and (2) the quality of submissions and taxonomies used is not as good as one would like...

Is CRISP or Compustat data available without a subscription?

Thank you for the suggestion. I have looked at his site which has much valuable information, including a snapshot (2021-01) of current industry classifications of public companies. However, it does not say what the source of the classification is, nor could I find any historical information, eg for public companies which are no longer around or? changes in classification for companies changing business. I understand that the historical information may be hard to get.

I could not, however, find any information on corporate events such as stock splits, dividends etc. Have you found any such information there?

I use data from yahoo finance to back out stock splits and dividends.  They
have adjusted and closing prices which you can use to back these out.

Quick bug description: using charts.PerformanceSummary, the drawdown plot
looks like it has a gap.

Min reproducible example using a simple moving average crossover on SPY:

require(quantmod)
require(TTR)
require(PerformanceAnalytics)

sma_strat <- function(prices, n_short = 1, n_long = 200, lag = 2) {
  returns <- na.omit(Return.calculate(prices))
  out <- lag(SMA(prices, n_short) > SMA(prices, n_long), 2) * returns
  return(out)
}

stratStats <- function(rets) {
  stats <- rbind(table.AnnualizedReturns(rets), maxDrawdown(rets))
  stats[5,] <- stats[1,]/stats[4,]
  stats[6,] <- stats[1,]/UlcerIndex(rets)

  stats <- rbind(stats, Omega(rets), SortinoRatio(rets),
                 skewness(rets), kurtosis(rets), VaR(rets))
  rownames(stats)[4] <- "Worst Drawdown"
  rownames(stats)[5] <- "Calmar Ratio"
  rownames(stats)[6] <- "Ulcer Performance Index"
  return(stats)
}

getSymbols('SPY', from = '1990-01-01')


spy_SMA_1_200 <- sma_strat(Cl(SPY))
spy_SMA_50_200 <- sma_strat(Cl(SPY), 50, 200)

compare <- na.omit(cbind(spy_SMA_1_200, spy_SMA_50_200))
colnames(compare) <- c("SPY_1_200", "SPY_50_200")

charts.PerformanceSummary(compare)
stratStats(compare)

Output:

Notice the gap in the drawdowns in 2008-2009 on the black line.

Just something I noticed now.
