I began testing the riingo package but whenever I try to call riingo_fundamentals_metrics() R tells me "could not find function..."

Is anyone successfully using the riingo_fundamentals_...() family of functions? Btw, I am running R 3.6.

I found that it requires an add-on subscription and have sent an e-mail requesting price information. Perhaps someone is already using this feature and can comment on it?

Hi Ilya,

It looks like this is an artifact of how that part of the plot is drawn.
The grid line and black drawdown line nearly overlap. I can see the line if
I make the plot larger.

Best,
Josh

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] lmForc package
Message-ID: <CAKN1paZn2R2dtvbZ7sYyeVsanS3nsShiE1hQ-YANqRgxMmi9JA@mail.gmail.com>

The R package lmForc (lmForc 0.1.0) is now available on CRAN. lmForc
introduces functions for evaluating linear forecasting models and a new
class for working with forecast data: Forecast. Test linear models
out-of-sample by conditioning on realized values, vintage forecasts, or
lagged values. Create and test performance weighted forecasts
out-of-sample. Collect multiple forecasts and evaluate MSE or RMSE. These
functions are built around the Forecast class which matches the simplicity
and interpretability of linear models.

For additional information and examples, please visit the lmForc GitHub
repository or check out the lmForc vignette.

I think you might want:

port <- add.objective(port, type = "risk", name = "StdDev", ?max =
0.0225)

I'm not sure that you'll be able to combine risk_aversion and a max
bound.

I'm not certain that 'risk_aversion' won't work, but I think that it
might be limited to a 'quadratic_utility' objective, which implies a
quadratic solver.

I'll try to take a look at the code in the coming days and see if I can
construct a self-contained, minimal, example.

Regards,

Brian

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Ask for assistance for the 3 littles problems i'm
 facing in my R web scraping function
Message-ID: <CAFobSmumg0H+uJOx7BTHv+eu=2yqagVcOHqqqcCj3ZQS7R4KLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to everybody.
I'm trying to scrape data by giving as input list of stocks.
If I perform the code or the function I get the expected result but once I
insert the code into a function the result does not come.
NB: The function shall return dataframe of every stock i'll list as input
 So I'm facing three problems:

 1. How to retry connecting to gsheet2tbl when the connection is very
    weak because the main function depend on the result of the
    gsheet2tbl connexion. `Error in open.connection(5L, "rb") : Timeout
    was reached: [docs.google.com] Connection timed out after 10000
    milliseconds In addition: Warning message: In for (i in seq_len(n))
    { : closing unused connection 5
    (
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/export?id=1rdjGjlQg7cUzWAEJFikrxOnisk-yQQx-n652sJUL-qc&format=csv&gid=0
)
    Called from: open.connection(5L, "rb") `.

2. When I apply the separate
    function I get warnings, however this in no way hinders the
    evolution of the code (so I would like to hide or ignore these
    warnings since if I have 10 listed companies, I will get 10
    identical warnings because of the `for` loop)

 3. How to send as result
    of the function the dataframes of all the stocks listed on the BRVM?
Below is the code
```
library(gsheet)
library(httr)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(rvest)
library(formattable)
library(data.table)
library(kableExtra)
##Some examples of Stocks symbols

You will have a better chance of receiving an answer
if you provide a small reproducible example.

Thanks Enrico.  I agree that a minimal reproducible example would be
necessary here.

Note that chart.EfficientFrontier works with *any* set of objectives
and constraints that PortfolioAnalytics supports.  

The classic closed form of the tangency portfolio doesn't support
weight constraints, for example (though there are versions which do).

As another example, the minimum variance portfolio which you may have
asked for will not equal the Max Sharpe Ratio portfolio. The tangency
portfolio is only "optimal" in the classic Markowitz mean-variance
convex portfolio context if you have asked for the max Sharpe ratio
portfolio from an unconstrained optimization.  

More complex objectives and constraints may create an 'optimal'
portfolio that does not lie on the efficient frontier.  For another
example, the Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) portfolio lies on a line
between the minimum variance portfolio and the equal weight portfolio.

Also, chart.EfficientFrontier will plot the tangent line only on the
two axes that make up the vertical and horizontal axes of the chart...
your objective set may have many more dimensions in a multi-objective
portfolio, and a three dimensional or n-dimensional surface may be a
better representation.  

You might also want to take a look at what the online version of Eric
Zivot's "Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial
Econometrics with R" has to say about the tangency portfolio:

https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introcompfinr/Efficient-portfolios-of.html


We really do need a minimal reproducible example though to look at
specifically what is going on in this case.

Regards,

Brian

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] In rugarch,
 is Johnson's SU distribution properly scaled to mean=0, variance=1?

Dear all,

I have a question about the `ugarchspec` and `ugarchfit` functions from the
`rugarch` package in R. I wonder if the likelihood function of the
univariate GARCH model specifies the standardized residuals to have zero
mean and unit variance when the (standardized) residuals follow Johnson's
SU distribution -- as in
uspec=ugarchspec(mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(0,0)),
variance.model=list(model="sGARCH"), distribution.model="jsu")

My question is partly motivated by Simonato "GARCH processes with skewed
and leptokurtic innovations: Revisiting the Johnson Su case" (2012). The
paper shows that care needs to be taken to parameterize Johnson's SU
distribution properly when using it in GARCH models. A counterexample is
given where an earlier paper has made some mistakes in that regard,
invalidating the model to an extent.

The `rugarch` manual and vignette are fairly brief when it comes to
Johnson's SU distribution, so I am struggling to find the answer there.
There is no reference to Simonato (2012) there. The relevant source codes
are available e.g. here
https://github.com/cran/rugarch/tree/master/R
and more specifically here
https://github.com/cran/rugarch/blob/master/R/rugarch-distributions.R,
but they are a bit challenging to follow.

My simulations show the resulting empirical means and variances of
standardized residuals to fluctuate a fair bit (e.g. empirical variance
being anywhere between 0.95 and 1.05). I am not sure if this is due to
estimation imprecision or some other reason. I observe this not only in the
Johnson's SU case but also in other cases (e.g. normal).

Thank you in advance for your help!

Simple to quickly test:

library(rugarch)

f1 <- function(x) x * ddist(distribution = "jsu", x, mu = 0, sigma = 1, 
skew = -10, shape = 0.5)
f2 <- function(x) x^2 * ddist(distribution = "jsu", x, mu = 0, sigma = 
1, skew = -10, shape = 0.5)

# Mean
integrate(f1, -Inf, Inf, rel.tol = 1e-12)$value
 >-1.145875e-16

# Variance
integrate(f2, -Inf, Inf, rel.tol = 1e-12)$value
 >1

Page 24 of the vignette 
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rugarch/vignettes/Introduction_to_the_rugarch_package.pdf)
clearly states that the re-parameterization? of this distribution is 
from the Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005) as implemented in their
gamlss package (and checked prior to implementing).

Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] Riingo package
Message-ID: <7d561caf-ed12-a2a1-155f-dd9a55c348b9@meddatainc.com>

Is anyone using riingo to access fundamental data? I have this add-on package from Tiingo but when I try using eg riingo_fundamentals_metrics() I get this error:

Error in riingo_fundamentals_metrics("AAPL") :
? could not find function "riingo_fundamentals_metrics"

Other stock functions in riingo seem to work fine. I tried detach("package:riingo") and then reloading it with no change in behavior.

Any suggestions what might be wrong? It would seem the issue would be with my setup, not with Tiingo. Btw, I am running R 3.6.0 under CentOS 7.

Thanks.

Thank you, good to know and I will try it if I cannot get the fundamentals functions in riingo to work. Do your additional functions for quantmode implement the same functionality as riingo does with respect to the fundamentals information, less or perhaps more?

Problem solved. It turned out that I was still on version 0.2.0 of riingo whereas the fundamentals were added later. I had never upgraded any packages since they were first installed so I found the appropriate commands for upgrading all packages, then forced an unload of riingo and once it was reloaded a quick test suggests it now works.

Mea culpa.

Hi all,

I was curious what you consider to be the most useful tools for generating
synthetic time series that behave "similarly" to an original series that
one has (one difficulty is certainly choosing metrics that define
"similarity" between two series, but that is an entirely different
discussion).

The advent of deep learning methods have introduced Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), which I have seen being used for that exact task. Other
methods that are often mentioned in this context are GARCH models.

I am now wondering whether anyone is familiar with additional methods that
can be and are used for the generation of artificial financial time series.

Thank you!

Have you investigated block bootstrap?

I don't have a proper answer to your question.  However, as an aside,
you might find these two old books of interest:

  https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Function-Futures-Markets/dp/0521389348/
  by Jeffrey C. Williams; (c) 1986

  https://www.amazon.com/Storage-Commodity-Markets-Jeffrey-Williams/dp/0521023394/
  by Jeffrey C. Williams, Brian D. Wright; (c) 1991

That second book is about commodity "storage model" theory, and walks
through a (totally deterministic, no random numbers involved) algorithm
for generating time-series with qualitative behavior similar to observed
real-world commodity prices.  It also talks about how ARMA and ARCH
models capture some of the statistical properties of the generated
series, but miss other parts.

So if you want an unusual, theory-motivated way of generating
realistic-looking price series with certain statistical properties,
that's one place to look.  (No, I haven't done it.  But their
pseudo-code starting on page 81 looks detailed enough to turn into a
real implementation if you wanted to.)
