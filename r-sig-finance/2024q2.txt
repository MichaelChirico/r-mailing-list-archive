Subject: [R-SIG-Finance] ugarchsim for data simulation
Message-ID: <2037726454.17107049.1715022122788.JavaMail.zimbra@furg.br>

Hi, everyone, 


I am using the ugarchsim comand from library rugarch for generating simulated data. I need to know if the data generated are squared or the root has already been extracted. 

Thank you,
