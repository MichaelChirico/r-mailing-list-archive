Maybe open.connection() should also check if the connection is already
open and given an error or at least a warning if it is. Suggested code
update:

open.connection <- function(con, open="r", blocking=TRUE, ...) {
  if (!inherits(con, "connection"))
    stop("argument is not a connection")
  if (isOpen(con))                                               # NEW
    stop("Trying to open a connection that is already open.")    # NEW
  invisible(.Internal(open(con, open, blocking)))

The following is from version 1.6.2 of R under Windows,

I am not sure how this should be handled.  I encountered it
in connection with densityplot().  In that connection, it
might be enough to modify density() so that it returns NA 
is these circumstances.  The following demonstrates the 
implications for densityplot().

> data(mtcars)

> densityplot(~mpg | carb)
Error in if (!(lo <- min(hi, IQR(x)/1.34))) (lo <- hi) || (lo <- abs(x[1])) ||  :

It already does, at a lower level where it will always check.

    o   An attempt to open() an already open connection will be detected

It comes from this bit of code:

> bw.nrd0
function (x)
{
    hi <- sd(x)
    if (!(lo <- min(hi, IQR(x)/1.34)))
        (lo <- hi) || (lo <- abs(x[1])) || (lo <- 1)
    0.9 * lo * length(x)^(-0.2)
}

in which hi is NA if x has length 1. A pragmatic way out would seem to
be to change the first line to 

hi <- if (length(x) > 1) sd(x) else 0

(and I wonder why the author didn't go all the way with the ||
sneakiness and said

    (lo <- min(hi, IQR(x)/1.34)) ||
        (lo <- hi) || (lo <- abs(x[1])) || (lo <- 1)

)

This is not reproducible.

Could you do a traceback() ? And please make sure you start with an empty 
workspace. I very much doubt it's a lattice problem, since bwplot is not 
supposed to call segments() at any point.

A wild guess would be that you are using some sort of S-PLUS code without 
telling us.

Note that two of the other three bandwith rules also require attention:
> bw.ucv(1)
Error in fmin(function(arg) f(arg, ...), lower, upper, tol) : 
        invalid xmin value
> bw.SJ(1)
Error in TDh(cnt, b, n, d) : NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 5)

The remaining rule has:
> bw.nrd(1)
[1] NA
which is reasonable.

Frank,

That's a rather old version of R-devel: a lot has changed since, including 
`show'.  At present print will be used, but that might change before 
release.

You should be able to fix this immediately by changing
options(defaultPackages) in the system profile to omit "methods", but you 
would be better off with a more recent snapshot.

Hi,

I trying to compile R-1.6.2 on Red Hat Linux 8.0 running on the Itanium2(IA64)
platform and encountered the following message:

make[1]: Entering directory `/home/nganm/R-1.6.2/src/modules/lapack'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/nganm/R-1.6.2/src/modules/lapack'
make: *** [R] Error 2

I have traced the problem to be: lapack.o is not compiled with the -fPIC flag,
but ld is trying to link it with code that is compiled with -fPIC. So, I need to
get gcc to compile lapack.c with the -fPIC. I don't know where to change the
Makefile or Makeconf. Please help.

Subject: [Rd] R-devel RNG change
Message-ID: <3E6371D3.4F13F1CB@bank-banque-canada.ca>

I find the documention for RNGversion in R-devel is a bit misleading, 
and suggest adding a sentence to make it clear that the meaning of 
"default" is not set to its meaning in the earlier R version:

      `RNGversion' can be used to set the random generators as they were
      in an earlier R{} version (for reproducibility). RNGversion does
      not set the meaning of "default" to its meaning in the earlier R{}
      version.

I also suggest the addition of a small function to query and set all 
aspects of random number generation. I find it is very useful to program with a
construct like:

 simulate <- function(model, rng=NULL, ...) 
   {if(is.null(rng)) rng <- set.RNG() # current settings to return with
simualtion object
    else        {old.rng <- set.RNG(rng);  on.exit(set.RNG(old.rng))  }
    ...
   }

and know that I have all the information for reproducibility. Below is a version
of this that I have been using for a few years. Its main shortcoming is that it
only considers the uniform generator and normal transformation.

Paul Gilbert
______
set.RNG <- function(kind=NULL, seed=NULL, normal.kind=NULL)
       {# with a null argument this also serves as get.RNG
        #The next line means that set.RNG with null args does not truly
        #  return the state of the RNG in the case when it has not been
        #  initialize. It first initializes it and then returns the state. The
        #  rational is that querying the state is usually for the purpose of
        #  reproducing it, so it must first be initialized to put it in a
        #  reproducible state.
        if (!exists(".Random.seed")) z <- runif(1)
        old <- list(kind=RNGkind()[1],normal.kind=RNGkind()[2], 
                    seed=.Random.seed[-1])
        if (is.null(kind) & is.null(seed) & is.null(normal.kind)) return (old)
        #kind can be a list as returned by a previous call to set.RNG
        if (is.list(kind))
           {seed        <- kind$seed
            normal.kind <- kind$normal.kind
            kind        <- kind$kind
           }
        remove(".Random.seed", envir=.GlobalEnv) # otherwise RNGkind complains
        RNGkind(kind=kind, normal.kind=normal.kind)
        if ( 1==length(seed)) set.seed(seed)
         else assign(".Random.seed", c(.Random.seed[1], seed), 
envir=.GlobalEnv)
        old
       }

# extract the RNG information from a (simulation) object
get.RNG <- function(e=NULL)UseMethod("get.RNG")
get.RNG.default <- function(e=NULL)
   {if (is.null(e)) return(set.RNG())
    # not sure if version information is useful?
    if      (!is.null(e$version))  v <- e$version
    else if (!is.null(e$noise))    v <- e$noise$version
    else v <- NULL
    if (is.null(v)) warning("version cannot be verified getting random 
seed.")
    else if (!all(unlist(version) == unlist(v)))
      warning("Seed used but version does not correspond to original. 
Differences may occur.")
   if      (!is.null(e$rng))  k <- e$rng
   else if (!is.null(e$noise)) k <- e$noise$rng
   else stop("RNG info not found.")
   k
  }

I also have documentation, but it needs to be cleaned up a bit.

Please do read about BUGS in the R FAQ, and ask on R-devel.  This is a bug 
in your setup, not in R, and R-bugs is not the place to ask for help.

open.o is not part of the non-existent lapack.o!  R uses Lapack.lo
compiled from Lapack.c, *with* -FPIC flags.  The problem is not in R.  
open.o is, I believe, part of libg2c, and it seems that your -lg2c (right
there on the link line) is not relocatable.

I see you are using `2.96'.  (RH8.0 on i386 uses gcc 3.2 on the machine I
just checked.)  I suggest you try a current *released* version of gcc as
on many platforms they do now have a shared libg2c.

However did you come to that conclusion: the errors are clearly reported 
to be in open.o.

Look in *R-devel*: it's a corruption of 1.7.0, which I am *sure* is what I
typed: I even have a printout.

After Brian Ripley suggested I get the latest version of R-devel, my show() problem, for an object for which I desired no special print method, was fixed.

I am glad to report that all examples passed R CMD check for both libraries using today's version of R-devel.

This feels like inconsistent behavior.  latticeParseFormula works the
way I anticipated for factor, but not for ordered.  I want the
behavior I see with tmp2, but not with tmp.  My next step is to use
the right.name to isolate the tmp2[,c("a","b")] columns.


tmp <- data.frame(y=(1:12)+.1,
                  a=factor(rep(1:3,4)),
                  b=ordered(rep(1:4, c(3,3,3,3))))
latticeParseFormula(as.formula(y ~ a + b), data=tmp)

tmp2 <- data.frame(y=(1:12)+.1,
                  a=factor(rep(1:3,4)),
                  b=factor(rep(1:4, c(3,3,3,3))))
latticeParseFormula(as.formula(y ~ a + b), data=tmp2)

The fact that an attempt at adding an unordered and an ordered factor gives an 
error 

1. is not a bug (at least I can't imagine why it would be so)
2. has nothing to do with latticeParseFormula

Also, I very much doubt that getting a bunch of NA's and a warning (which you 
seem to have omitted from your output) is really what you anticipated when 
you added two (unordered) factors.

Please first report what you think are bugs on r-devel before filing bug 
reports.

I didn't get a warning.  I got exactly what I sent.

The NA doesn't bother me since I am interested in parsing the expression,
specifically to see what is to the left of the "~" and what is to the
right of the "~".   I am interested in components left.name and right.name,
.I am not interested in left and right.  My inference from your response
is that I should work with the parse tree from 
  parse(text="y ~ a + b")
rather than continue pushing latticeParseFormula.

On the other issue that you raised, I am surprised to learn that R
can add factors to factors and ordered to ordered.  I didn't expect either
case.  However, given that it can do something, I still would expect
that it could add them to each other by recognizing that ordered inherits
from factor.

That's odd. Because I get a warning on Linux, and on the outside chance that 
this might be a Windows issue, I just installed R 1.6.2 on Windows 2000 and 
got

Maybe you want something like

  For various reasons, I've opted to make my packages available from my 
own web page rather than submitting them to CRAN (mostly laziness -- for 
a long time I didn't have the packages quite cleaned up enough to pass all 
the tests).  It occurred to me to wonder about the scripts used by CRAN 
maintainers to generate the PACKAGES file, and to generate PACKAGES.html 
from PACKAGES.  Are those something that could be made available?  Or 
do people think that I should bite the bullet and submit my packages to 
CRAN instead?

Though you might also want to look at Bioconductor's reposTools package,
which is designed to manage packages with multiple repositories.

You might want to take a peak at the 'reposTools' package distributed by
the Bioconductor project (www.bioconductor.org).  Specifically, take a
look at the three vignettes about reposTools at:
http://www.bioconductor.org/viglistingindex.html

One of the vignettes details how to construct a small repository of
packages.

There are HTML generation tools provided by the package if you wish to
distribute your packages via the web.  Also, why the standard
install.packages()/etc don't work with a reposTools repository it does
include its own set of client side functions XXX.packages2(), which are
detailed in the vignette on accessing repositories.

The package itself can be downloaded from the site, either in it's
released version:
http://www.bioconductor.org/repository/release1.1/package/html/index.html
or developmental version:
http://www.bioconductor.org/repository/devel/package/html/index.html

Is there any chance of a CVS repository for public but not necessarily 
CRAN-quality R Code? Or better still, a sourceforge-type site (ForgeRy?)
based on GForge with all the goodies that such sites have for 
cooperative development (forums, task management, bug tracking etc). I 
already have a couple of projects on sourceforge but I think its a bit 
daunting for new people. Perhaps an R-specific forge site would be more 
welcoming?

  Or even better better still, an entire web-based R community site, 
with discussions and news and code snippets and words of wisdom 
something like www.perlmonks.org?

  I'll be at DSC2003 if anyone wants to beat me senseless with a tree 
for suggesting this.

  OK, then, one more concern: I'm trying to decide on an appropriate level 
of resolution for distributing packages.  At the moment I have "bbmisc", 
which is a package bundle consisting of about 6 packages of varying size 
and specificity -- does that seem reasonable?  Or do people prefer more, 
smaller bits on CRAN?

Recently in R-devel, I've noticed that when I start up R, code in
.Rprofile (in the working directory) gets sourced but any messages printed
out by that code (e.g. by `cat') are printed *before* the introductory
statement about R.

For example, if I put the line

library(KernSmooth)

in my .Rprofile file, I get

I assume this is because of the order in which packages are loaded.  I was
wondering if this behavior is desired?  I couldn't find anything in
?Startup.

Obviously not a critical issue but it seems a bit odd. Of course, if I
wrap everything with a call to .First() in my .Rprofile file, then the
package gets loaded last and the corresponding messages are printed last.  

I'm using

What's changed is when the introductory message is printed, not when code 
in .Rprofile is run:

revision 1.118
date: 2003/02/26 15:51:17;  author: pd;  state: Exp;  lines: +6 -6
RNG change + delayed greeting

So it was intentional, but Peter D will have to explain why (as I wasn't
paying attention).

The profiles are run quite early (before the default packages are loaded)
and I think it is preferable to use .First to load packages (now the
system no longer makes use of it for that purpose).

In spite of the reposTools developments mentioned, I agree with
Dirk that it's best submitting to CRAN -- at least for the time being.
One strong argument for CRAN is that the R Core team "looks"
(via grep etc) at the CRAN sources frequently in deciding about
new features, possible back-compatibility breaking changes etc etc.
Also the CRAN maintainers daily check all CRAN packages against
the curren *development* version(s) of R -- and make sure
CRAN packages continue to run "R CMD check" -- or the package
maintainer is notified about something we consider an ``infelicity'',
(e.g. using non-API C calls into R code; using "internal" R
 functions that might be changed, etc etc).

Many from R core would prefer stand-alone packages instead of
bundles quite a bit. {some have even proposed to drop bundle support.}

If you have one ``base package'' and all the other just needing
that one, I'd put something like  stopifnot(require(mybasepkg)) statements
in the .First.Lib of the other packages and still put them on
CRAN separately.

If you have very good reasons for the bundle, well..

I need to review this, and quite possibly change it back (or revise
things more thoroughly). I was working on the assumption that the
loads before the greeting wouldn't print anything, and that is clearly
wrong.

The basic idea of moving it down is that that allows a GUI to be fired
up from a startup script, with the greeting ending up in the GUI
console rather than the terminal you started it from.

Don't keep bundle support around just on my account. The one thing that I think
is useful is that the inter-dependencies in my packages also depend on package
versions, and I don't think require() checks versions. By putting the packages
in a bundle I am relatively sure a user will get versions of the packages that
are suppose to work together. Of course, this is a bigger problem than just my
packages, so a more comprehensive solution would be better.

This is also a problem that reposTools attempts to solve.  Currently when
you try to install/update/download a package from a repository, it will
compare dependencies (listed in the "Depends" field of DESCRIPTION) and
retriee the specified packages/versions.

I found that if a numeric vector is used to set the line type in
segments(), then any NA values get plotted with a particular pattern,
rather than omitted as usually happens with NAs. Similarly, 

  plot(rnorm(5),type="l",lty=as.numeric(NA))

does plot a line, curiously enough not with the same pattern as

  plot(1:7,2:8)
  segments(1:5,2:6,4:8,3:7,lty=c(NA,1:4))

lty=NA (i.e. logical NA) gives an error.

Surely this is more a bug than a feature?

I was hoping that updating to Version 1.6.2 would make my bug go away.

But if you can not reproduce this bug, then what is it about my system that
is different from yours?

Thank you,

Actually, I only get the problem if I use R Version 1.6.2 as automatically
installed by 'fink'.  If I download the source directly myself for Version
1.6.2 from CRAN and compile it, then I get the proper eigenvalues.  Seems
strange to me - I thought that the source code in the fink repository should
be identical to that at CRAN?

Dear Stefano,

Yes, I have updated to R Version 1.6.2  (2003-01-10), running it in a
Terminal window under Darwin Kernel Version 6.4.

And, while La.eigen() appears to work fine, I still have the same problem
with eigen():

Dan:  Do you by any chance have atlas installed?  My guess is that when
you compile it with fink it links the atlas lapack libs, but when you
compile it yourself it links Apple's vecLib.  I'll look into it.  In the
meantime, could you run otool -L on R.bin (the one you compiled yourself)?

I thought about this. It would be nice to have the behaviour Patrick 
Burns proposes, but there is a problem: What to do when the 
length one argument is numeric? Look at the following:

So what to do with length one numerical arguments, truncate, as seems 
to be done (but not always):

> sample(0.99)
[1] 0.99

or round, or give an error if not a positive integer, or? 
However it is done it will surely break some code.

First off, the fix that I propose doesn't change the behaviour when the 
argument is
numeric.  We are certainly stuck with sample being "helpful" in that case.

The proposed fix does allow a reasonable workaround when the first argument
might have length one:

as.numeric(sample(x + 0+0i, ...))

Pat

Subject: [Rd] modifying ftable to allow percentages (wishlist) (PR#2606)
Message-ID: <200303051710.h25HAcn9018168@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: John Hendrickx

(This is not a bug report but a request to add a feature to future versions of
R. Hope this is an appropriate place).

I'd like to suggest adding an option to ftable to allow percentages. It would be
easy to do and backwards compatible. Percentage tables are useful in educational
contexts, whereas lack of a simple method for calculating percentages gives an
incorrect impression of the maturity of R IMHO.

To add percentage tables to ftable, an option such as

pcnt=c("n", "row", "column", "total","gtotal")

could be added to ftable.default. Prior to the "y <- aperm" near the end of
ftable, the following lines would be added:

pcnt<-match.arg(pcnt)
if (pcnt!="n") {
    if (pcnt=="row")    {mrg2drop<-col.vars[length(col.vars)]}
    if (pcnt=="column") {mrg2drop<-row.vars[length(row.vars)]}
    if (pcnt=="total") 
{mrg2drop<-c(col.vars[length(col.vars)],row.vars[length(row.vars)])}
    if (pcnt=="gtotal") {mrg2drop<-0}
    x<-prop.table(x,i[-mrg2drop])*100
}

The pcnt option would default to "n" in which case nothing would happen, ftable
would work as presently. If pcnt="row" were used, percentages would sum to 100
over the last variable of col.vars for each row. For pcnt="column", percentages
would sum to 100 over the last variable of row.vars for each column. For
pcnt="total", percentages would sum to 100 for the last variable in row.vars and
col.vars, i.e. separately for each subtable. If pcnt="gtotal" were used, the
table would sum to 100 over the complete table.

One further modification would be needed in order to use percentages in
ftable.formula. Line 42 of ftable.formula, where ftable is called if
(inherits(edata, "ftable") is true would have to be changed to 

ftable(data, row.vars = rvars, col.vars = cvars, ...)

The ... argument would have to be added to pass pcnt= to ftable.default.

These seem to me to be minor changes that would add a useful functionality to R.
(Unless of course Guru[k] already has something much more sophisticated in the
pipeline). Would it be a problem to implement this in future versions of R?

Yours truly,
John Hendrickx

Subject: [Rd] Some bugs in Rcmd check ? (PR#2608)
Message-ID: <200303061313.h26DDjn9026131@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hello!

I have some problems using Rcmd, bacause I get errors I do not understand. I
will write down what I did. Perhaps you can help me?

I have a small would-be package called "globaltest", containing only the
files
DESCRIPTION
INDEX
R/globaltest.R
man/globaltest.Rd

I say:
C:\>Rcmd check C:/Goeman/globaltest

In the output it first complains that 'sh', 'make', 'cp' are not
recognizable commands, programs or batch files.

Later it says
*** Installation of globaltest failed *** 

Then it says:
* checking R files for library.dynam ...Error: cannot open file
'C://globaltest.Rcheck/globaltest/R/globaltest' for reading at
c:\R\rw1062/bin/check line 617.

And it terminates.

What did I do wrong? I would be grateful if you could tell me.

Kind regards,

Jelle Goeman

Hi,
You should probably have asked on R-help about this one. This is not a
bug. The error
message was very clear; cmd check could not find make or cp. You need
several tools to 
build packages on windows. Dr Ripley maintains a very helpful web page
with links to all 
the tools you need to build packages from source on windows at,

When data.frames are written to a file using write.table and with row.names and
col.names, then the colnames are displaced by 1 with respect to column content.
Example:


> x = data.frame(
>   obscht=c("chriesi", "bire"),
>     gmues=c("chrut","hoerdoepfl"))
> rownames(x) = c("huet", "morn")
> write.table(x, file="test.txt", sep="\t", quote=F)

The table x now looks like:
> x
      obscht      gmues
huet chriesi      chrut
morn    bire hoerdoepfl

but the file is as follows, and the column names will be confused when reading
this file e.g. from Excel.

obscht	gmues
huet	chriesi	chrut
morn	bire	hoerdoepfl

AFAIK that is a feature. Look at the example(write.table), it does precisely
this and gets data back and forth to Excel.

Hi Dirk,

thanks! Seems I should have better read the documentation, sorry for 
wasting your time.

I had never been sure whether the default behavior of write.table was a
bug or a feature and as this topic had come up today again, someone had
encouraged me to submit a bug report :)

Best regards
Wolfgang

There was no need to send this twice: this is also PR#2611.

This _is_ the documented behaviour, and it _is_ also discussed in the R
Import/Export Manual.  ?write.table says:

     Normally there is no column name for a column of row names.  If
     `col.names=NA' a blank column name is added.  This can be used to
     write CSV files for input to spreadsheets.

Please _only_ send messages once and _only_ after reading at least the 
help page.  Your lack of reading is not a bug in R.

The separators are not visible there.  Try

>  write.table(x, file="", sep=",", quote=F)
obscht,gmues
huet,chriesi,chrut
morn,bire,hoerdoepfl

to see what is really going on.

..Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.

..There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
..To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
..Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
..cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
..internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
..This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above

Alternatively, I'd prefer allowing  rowlab = ""

BTW: You've helped uncovering a problem in R-devel: 
  There, `rowlab' and `collab' are currently silently not working  :
  print.matrix() doesn't have them anymore, only prmatrix() does
  {which is not the same any more}

The drawback of such an approach is that you need explicit
print(.) calls (which may look a bit ugly).
An alternative approach is to use default printing for a new
object made from the original one --- though I must admit I'm
not 100% convinced it's appropriate for your original proposal:

Relatedly (but not identically aimed), I have had an alternative
implemented from an S-news "discussion" including Bill Venables
of about 1993. 

The way it's here, it's not working for data frames (just for
matrices, but also other arrays), also since data frames must
have unique row names by definition.
But you get the main idea :

empty.dimnames <- function(a)
{
  ## 'Remove' all dimension names from an array for compact printing.
  d <- list(); l <- 0
  for(i in dim(a)) d[[l <- l + 1]] <- rep("", i)
  dimnames(a) <- d
  a
}

with help :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

empty.dimnames            package:sfsmisc            R Documentation

Empty Dimnames of an Array.

Description:

     `Remove' all dimension names from an array for compact printing.

Usage:

     empty.dimnames(a)

Arguments:

       a: an `array', especially a matrix.

Value:

     Returns `a' with its dimnames replaced by empty character strings.

Author(s):

     Bill Venables / Martin Maechler, Sept 1993.

See Also:

     `unname' removes the dimnames.

Examples:

     empty.dimnames(diag(5)) # looks much nicer

     (a <- matrix(-9:10, 4,5))
     empty.dimnames(a) # nicer, right?

Subject: [Rd] RFC: str(ordered(.))
Message-ID: <15976.44597.910279.820568@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

I'm about to commit the following new feature for R-devel aka "pre-R 1.7.0":

    o	str() now shows ordered factors differently than unordered ones.

The RFC (Request For Comment) is about which string should be
printed.
I was going to use the following

 > str(ordered(4:1))
  Ord.factor w/ 4 levels "1"<"2"<"3"<"4": 4 3 2 1

i.e., use "Ord.factor" where we currently have "Factor".
I found this better than "Ord.fac." or "Ordered"  which would be
closer in length than the current "Factor" {string length *is*
an issue for str()}.

Comments are welcome.

In trying to get R CMD check to run for Hmisc and Design, I get a lot of warnings about key words that are not defined to R.  Is there now a way to add new key words to the master list, or to have a local list that is concatenated to the master?  Here are some of the keywords I use in my packages:

bootstrap, power (power and sample size calculations), dstudy (study design), trellis, grouping, sampling, accuracy (model predictive accuracy), overview, validate (model validation), lrm (logistic regression model)

Thanks,
Frank

That's part of `make check', so you would expect it to run (and it does on
all my systems with the current version in the CVS).  I can only guess
that the snapshot you have has an inconsistency, although I can see no
relevant changes at about that time.

methods(plot) is not going to be very useful in these days of namespaces:
it only shows user-callable methods, and methods are often going to be
unexported but registered. (That's something we need to address in the
documentation, at least.)

I've since thought of a possible explanation, but one that was changed on 
Saturday so should be correct in yesterday's R-devel.

This is what happened when an S4-style method was sent on `print'.
Did you do this in a vanilla session?

Subject: [Rd] Problem with example(medpolish) in R-devel

I should say I originally encountered this when `make fullcheck' failed
while running the `eda' examples.  But the problem is gone today.

Hi,

R CMD check is causing some "make sure it passes check, #@#$@%% !!
- I *did* check it passes check #$%#$!5 !!!" disagrement...

I currently have two versions of the same package... one goes through
the check, the other does not.

bin/R CMD check ~/these/R/affy --library=${HOME}/myRlib
does while
bin/R CMD check ~/these/R/affy-taniwha/affy --library=${HOME}/myRlib
does not

This is already fixed: *please* don't send bug reports on obselete 
versions of R, especially without checking the current NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.6.2

...

    o	system(intern=TRUE) has an undocumented line length limit of
	119 chars both on Unix and Windows.  The limit is now 8096 and
	documented.  On Unix (only) every 120th character used to be
	discarded.

Not so in 1.6.2:

[1]

You might at least have checked the NEWS file for 1.6.2:

    o   system(intern=TRUE) has an undocumented line length limit of
        119 chars both on Unix and Windows.  The limit is now 8096 and
        documented.  On Unix (only) every 120th character used to be

Hi,

R-devel causes me still trouble. It dies with
Error: couldn't find function "predict.loess"
Execution halted
for the package affy, but
bash-2.04$ grep predict.loess ~/R-devel/src/library/modreg/R/*.R
/misc/homes/laurent/R-devel/src/library/modreg/R/loess.R:predict.loess <- function(object, newdata = NULL, se = FALSE, ...)
bash-2.04$ 


..the function seems to be there...



Cheers,


L.

Please use a meaningful subject line: yours was far too vague.

That's a problem with the package, not R-devel: it should not be calling a
method.  Do note the USER-VISIBLE CHANGES in the NEWS file:

    o   Namespaces can now be defined for packages other than `base':
        see `Writing R Extensions'.  This hides some internal objects
        and changes the search path from objects in a namespace.  All
        the base packages (except methods and tcltk) have namespaces,
        as well as the recommended packages `KernSmooth', `MASS',
        `boot', `class', `nnet', `rpart' and `spatial'.

predict.loess is no longer user-visible. Calling predict() will work with
correctly-written code.

There are still a few (three I think) such problems in the CRAN packages, 
and you can't expect all packages to have been updated for a version that 
is not even feature-frozen as yet.

From: Carlisle.Thacker at noaa.gov (W. C. Thacker)
Date: Wed Mar 12 14:58:26 2003
Subject: [Rd] job opportunity
Message-ID: <3E6F3DAC.EE52C60B@noaa.gov>

The University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Sciences (RSMAS) is seeking a research associate to work with
hydrographic data.  The objective of the project is to develop
statistical models for estimating salinity and density from
observations of temperature together with knowledge of location and
time.  Because the relationship between salinity and temperature can
be highly variable due to meandering fronts, it is important to be
able to recognize from which side of a front the data come.
Consequently, developing a water-type classifier is part of the
project.  Once the models have been developed, they are to be
implemented as a component of computational codes for assimilating
data into an ocean-circulation model.

The relationship between temperature and salinity is to be derived
from a database of temperature-salinity-pressure profiles irregularly
distributed over the world oceans and over the past thirty years.  A
much larger data-base of temperature-depth profiles is available for
use in predicting salinity.  Satellite-based observations are
available to help in determining where the more recent data are
situated relative to fronts.  The equation of state for sea water can
be used to transform the estimated salinity, together with observed
temperature, into estimates for density.  The salinity estimates
should be constrained so that the resulting density increases
monotonically with depth.

The successful candidate should have substantial computational skills.
Ability to work with large data sets is imperative, as is the ability
to examine the data graphically.  Some knowledge of statistics is
essential, especially regression, classification, and spatial
statistics.  Experience with splus and matlab is highly desirable, as
is facility with fortran and/or C.  He/she should be comfortable
working in a unix environment.  Experience working with hydrographic
data, while not essential, is certainly desirable.

The work is to be done in collaboration with scientists at UM and at
the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), so
there will be substantial guidance in how to approach the project.
However, the successful candidate should be able to function with a
minimal of supervision once the project is underway and he/she should
assume responsibility for the project's success.  Salary will reflect
the candidate's experience and qualifications.

RSMAS and AOML are located on Virginia Key, a short drive across
Biscayne Bay from downtown Miami, Florida.  Contact Arthur Marino
(305-361-4193/marino@rsmas.miami.edu) or Carlisle Thacker
(305-361-4323/thacker@aoml.noaa.gov) for further information.  To
apply, send resume to Jean Overton, RSMAS, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway,
Miami FL 33149.  Please include names, addresses, and phone numbers of
at least three references.

Subject: [Rd] class of integers
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.51.0303121706310.30570@artemis.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de>


Hi,

I'm a little bit confused about the class of integers (with yesterdays
r-devel):

R> a <- 1:10
R> class(a)
[1] "integer"
R> inherits(a, "integer")
[1] FALSE
R> data.class(a)
[1] "numeric"
R> is.numeric(a)
[1] TRUE
R> inherits(a, "numeric")
[1] FALSE


data.class is consistent with R-1.6.2, ok. The class of "a" is integer,
also ok. At first: why does "inherits" state that "a" is not of class
integer nor numeric?

And at second: one possible way of writing portable code (between 1.6.2
and 1.7.0) for generics is using:

foo <- function(y, ...) {
  if(is.null(class(y)))
    class(y) <- data.class(y)
  UseMethod("foo", y, ...)
}

foo.default <- function(y, ...) {
  stop(paste("Do not know how to handle objects of class", class(y)))
}

(the thread "[Rd] Methods package is now attached by default" around Jan
20th discussed this)

If I have

foo.numeric <- function(y, ...)
  ...

this works with R-1.6.2 but since foo now dispatches on "class(y)" this
fails for integers with r-devel. Does this mean that I have to implement
foo.integer methods?

Best,

Torsten

You really want

R> is(a, "integer")
[1] TRUE

But note that we need to update class.Rd in base: e.g., it currently
says

     `unclass' returns (a copy of) its argument with its class
     information removed.

Try

foo <- function(y, ...) {
    if(is.null(oldClass(y))) oldClass(y) <- data.class(y)
    UseMethod("foo", y, ...)
}

or for 1.6.2 compatibility

foo <- function(y, ...) {
    if(is.null(attr(y, "class"))) attr(y, "class") <- data.class(y)
    UseMethod("foo", y, ...)
}  

(not actually tested).

No, but it is the cleanest route.

Hi,

the graphical parameter "cex.axis" does not have any affect for "boxplot":

data(iris)
boxplot(iris[,1:4], ylab="y", cex.lab=2, cex.axis=2)


The patch is simply adding "cex.axis" to the search for axis relevant
parameters in "bxp":

ax.pars <- pars[names(pars) %in% c("xaxt", "yaxt", "las", "cex.axis")]

Best,

Torsten

The following works:
  par(cex.axis=2)
  boxplot(iris[,1:4], ylab="y")

Hence not clearly a bug.
And again we have the discusion whether to implement almost all par() 
arguments in functions like boxplot() / bxp() or not. I'll bet there are 
also a few other par() arguments that don't work with bxp().

I refer to Martin Maechler's mail (17.12.02: [Rd] Changing "..." inside 
a function: impossible? desirable?).

Is there a decision (by R-Core)?
Is it desirable to have (almost) (all) par() arguments work as arguments 
of highlevel plot functions?

grid has a pdf file in inst/doc. but it's not a vignette.  So

> print(.readRDS("library/grid/Meta/vignette.rds"))
[1] File     Title    Depends  Keywords PDF     
<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)

The code in library() does not seem to be able to cope with that case.

My point is that NA's should be reported for logicals like they are for 
other data types.

Right. I reported this two days ago on 'r-help' (maybe the wrong place).
In the copy of my report below you also see the (a?) solution.

G?ran
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the following two ways of stair steps plotting:

plo <- function(ty = 2, steps = 200){
  old.par <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
  x <- seq(1, 100, length = steps)
  y <- seq(1, 10, length = steps)
  plot(x, y, type = "s", lty = ty, main = "Stair steps")

  x <- rep(x, each = 2)[-1]
  y <- rep(y, each = 2)[-2*steps]
  plot(x, y, type = "l", lty = ty, main = "Line steps")
  par(old.par)
}
[...]

Subject: [Rd] The function 'apply' (PR#2633)
Message-ID: <200303132219.h2DMJen9003276@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Paul Louisell
Version: 1.6.2
OS: Windows NT
Submission from: (NULL) (192.249.47.9)


I've found a problem with either the 'apply' or 'is.factor' functions, and it
seems like it might be cause for concern. Here are the commands taken directly
from the R session:

> is.factor(test.frame[, 1])
[1] TRUE
> is.factor(test.frame[, 2])
[1] TRUE
> is.factor(test.frame[, 3])
[1] TRUE
> is.factor(test.frame[, 4])
[1] TRUE
> apply(test.frame, 2, is.factor)
   X1    X2    X3    X4 
FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 


All of the variables in test.frame are factors, and is.factor returns TRUE when
it's used on each factor individually. When it's used inside of apply, all of
the variables return the value FALSE. So there's something wrong in at least one
of these functions.

No. Apply works on matrices, so the first thing that happens is that
the data.frame is coerced to a matrix and

> as.matrix(test.frame)
  a   b   c
1 "1" "1" "1"
2 "2" "2" "2"
3 "3" "3" "3"

doesn't have factors as columns. Similarly

> test.frame <- data.frame(a=letters[1:3],n=1:3)
> as.matrix(test.frame)
  a   n
1 "a" "1"
2 "b" "2"
3 "c" "3"
> apply(test.frame,2,mode)
          a           n
"character" "character"

This is quite explicitly stated in the help page for apply().

You need lapply() if you want to query dataframe elements:

> lapply(test.frame,is.numeric)
$a
[1] FALSE

$n
[1] TRUE

Not quite.  It requires the corresponding version of the VR
bundle (with its main part MASS).

After unpacking the R-devel sources,
you need to get the **corresponding**  recommended packages by
typing
	tools/rsync-recommended

before you configure and make !

The `something wrong' is in your reading (or lack of it).  Not checking 
the help page before filing a bug report just wastes the developer's time.
That *is* `a cause for concern': it applies to far too many bug reports.

Let me read the help(apply) page for you:

       X: the array to be used.

Details:

     If `X' is not an array but has a dimension attribute, `apply'
     attempts to coerce it to an array via `as.matrix' if it is
     two-dimensional (e.g. data frames) or via `as.array'.


so test.frame (presumably a data frame) is coerced to a matrix and the 
results are correct.

What I believe you intended can be done by sapply(test.frame, is.factor).

If you do ever find a real bug in R, please supply a reproducible example 
with your report.  You have omitted to tell us what test.frame is.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.30.0303140402160.13480-100000@ysidro.econ.uiuc.edu>

This is a suggestion to modify the behavior of [.terms in base so that behaves as in
library(survival).  In my 1.7.0 (which is admittedly a couple of weeks old):

> tt <- terms(y~qss(x)+qss(z)+w,specials="qss")
> tt
y ~ qss(x) + qss(z) + w
attr(,"variables")
list(y, qss(x), qss(z), w)
attr(,"factors")
       qss(x) qss(z) w
y           0      0 0
qss(x)      1      0 0
qss(z)      0      1 0
w           0      0 1
attr(,"term.labels")
[1] "qss(x)" "qss(z)" "w"
attr(,"specials")
attr(,"specials")$qss
[1] 2 3

attr(,"order")
[1] 1 1 1
attr(,"intercept")
[1] 1
attr(,"response")
[1] 1
attr(,".Environment")
<environment: R_GlobalEnv>

With survival loaded you can do something like the following:

>  tmpc <- untangle.specials(tt,"qss")
> tmpc
$vars
[1] "qss(x)" "qss(z)"

$terms
[1] 1 2

> tt[-tmpc$terms]
y ~ w
attr(,"variables")
list(y, w)
attr(,"factors")
  w
y 0
w 1
attr(,"term.labels")
[1] "w"
attr(,"specials")
attr(,"specials")$qss
NULL

attr(,"order")
[1] 1
attr(,"intercept")
[1] 1
attr(,"response")
[1] 1
attr(,".Environment")
<environment: R_GlobalEnv>

This is rather handy for preprocessing additive nonparametric components of the formula
for example.  Without survival loaded [ operates on the formula not the terms object to
a much less satisfactory effect.

Thanks to Thomas Lumley for pointing out to me that survival had this capability...

Subject: [Rd] 1.7.0 scheduled for April 16
Message-ID: <x2ptoujf96.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


We have now (actually a few days ago) declared a "Grand Feature
Freeze" on the development sourcs, meaning that we might still add
functionality and fix bugs, but we will not do any further major
changes. 

It should be noted that there has been a couple of quite big changes
compared to the 1.6.x series, notably namespaces and the methods
package. Also, many more packages are now loaded by default. This
would be a good time for package writers to  adjust their packages to
work with 1.7.0 if necessary.

Two important dates in the near future:

March 26:

    Feature freeze, simultaneously on base and recommended packages.
    It is assumed that all recommended packages pass their checks at
    this point. The API should not be touched.
    
    Start making R-1.7.0beta.tgz packages automatically available and
    encourage people to do test builds. 


April 9:

    Code freeze. Only critical and/or trivial bugs fixed from this
    time onwards. Configure/make should only be touched in
    emergencies. 

Obviously, we cannot be sure that all changes before the final code
freeze will be compatible with all packages, so please keep checking
the beta versions as much as you can, especially if you are on one of
the rarer platforms.

There is a file 

http://developer.r-project.org/170update.txt 

which gives advice on what is likely to be needed and how to adjust.
It's updated frequently, including a few minutes ago.

Full_Name: Neil McKay
Version: 1.6.1
OS: Linux (Redhat 7.1)
Submission from: (NULL) (129.124.42.210)


Specifying loop=true in a call to read.socket results in lost characters. To
see
the bug, set up an R server as follows:

sock <- make.socket(port=5432, server=TRUE);
while(TRUE) {
    c<-read.socket(sock, maxlen=1, loop=TRUE);
    cat(c, "\n", sep="", collapse="");
}

In another invocation of R, write this client:

sock<-make.socket("localhost", 5432);
write.socket(sock, "abc---xyz3210AA<>");
close.socket(sock);

The "-", "0", and "<>" characters will be dropped by the server. The cause is in
the
R code for read.socket. The line

    if (rval > 0 || !loop)

should be

    if (nchar(rval) > 0 || !loop)

(This bug occurs on Windows also, so I suspect it's in all versions of R.)

This has been rather annoying for me, because I sometimes write C and C++
versions of the same program side by side and so the files have the same

don't understand the relevant scripts enough to suggest a patch.

The "fix" is relatively simple. One can change the order of the
suffixes listed in $R_HOME/etc/Makeconf (i.e. the Makeconf.in version)
to alter the precedence. If one changes the line

 .SUFFIXES: .c .cc .cpp .C .d .f .lo .o

to place the '.c' after the '.cc', your example will work as you want it.

While the behavior is not desirable since you specified foo.cc on the
command line for R CMD SHLIB, I don't think it is a good idea to be
using files named x.c and x.cc in the same directory.  I would think
that this will lead to confusions with other tools and I can't think
of a context in which it is necessary.

Just to clarify. Is this something that you (ie. R developers) are
planning to change, or are you just recommending that I change it? If so,
it will break on every upgrade. Wonder if I can put this in Makevars as a
local override, though...

Hmm. Perhaps using makefiles would be easier, really.

Mmm. Certainly not *necessary*. I still think it is a bug, though.

Subject: [Rd] R-devel on Darwin
Message-ID: <6C140055-581A-11D7-B8C3-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

I am trying to build R-devel on Darwin with two-level namespaces
and without using --bundle_loader path/to/R.bin, so that all symbols
must come from libR.dylib. This goes well, until during the methods
package build all.rda must be made from all.R. Then I get

dumping R code in package 'methods'
Error: Object "dataClass" not found
Execution halted

I can get past this point by copying an old all.rda from 1.6.2
to library/methods/R, but not surprisingly (!!) I then get into trouble
when trying to start R.

Suppose you have a class, say sex, for lack of a better example, and
you are tempted, in defining the behavior of the call,

	is(x,"sex")

to check whether certain basic features are satisfied, not to just trust the claim
that x is specified to be of class "sex". `Without delving into details
further sanity checking of the structure of the object is sometimes prudent to
avoid subsequent nonsense.  This checking could be built into the is method,
but the documentation for "new" suggests that one might alternatively want to
define a method, "initialize" that was used to create objects of class "sex"
and not let people just create such objects willy-nilly.  My questions are these:

1.  Am I correct in thinking that initialize is the right way to handle this?

2.  Are there examples of the initialize strategy, beyond the one given in
the "new" documentation?

3.  Are there efficiency issues that one should be cautious about?

4.  Is there any way to enforce the Foucaultian imperative that any new
"sex" object has to pass through the initialize phase?


Oh, for those simple days of yesteryore when the pecadillos of the president
caused no harm, and the Dow was over 10,000...

Apologies in advance if this moment of sexistential doubt offends anyone.

Function dataClass() was removed from r-devel a few days ago, but I
assume is still around in the old all.rda you have to use when dumping
methods with two-level namespaces.

Subject: [Rd] Changes in checking & error messages
Message-ID: <3E75E2ED.7A688BA7@research.bell-labs.com>

Some fixes have been made to check a few errors better & to report
something like the correct error message in other cases.

- setMethod will now refuse to set a method for a primitive function for
a basic class ("[<-" for "matrix", for example).  Previously the method
was set but never dispatched.  (For a few days, the change prohibited
some valid methods for operators, with one basic operand, but that case
should be fixed now.  Thanks, Vince.)

- a number of functions such as getMethods, showMethods, etc. should
give better error messages if presented with arguments they don't
understand.  There are some additional low-level checks in various
places that should replace error messages about objects at the C level
with no slots by more comprehensible information.

Please report any glitches that seem to have been introduced.

John

Well, it depends.  Sometimes (in dispatching methods, e.g.) you don't
want to ask too deeply about what the object REALLY is, but would just
like to (excuse the expression in the context) "get on with it", given a
basic assertion.

That's fundamentally what is() does:  it simply checks the class
inheritance structure for class(x).

The function defined to poke more deeply into the issue is
validObject():

	validObject(x)

checks as much as possible into whether x is a valid object of its
class.  Some checks are built in (slots of the right classes, etc.). 
Others if needed can be incorporated in the class definitions (argument
validity=) or via setValidity().  Validity checking uses inheritance, so
validity methods for contained classes will be applied.

Well, about the best there is, for a single attack.  See comment to your
point 3.

I believe some of the packages in BioConductor use initialize methods. 
Others??

> 3.  Are there efficiency issues that one should be cautious about?

Indeed.  The "obvious" strategy is:  if the class has a validity method,
direct or inherited, then initialize() should invoke it.  The default
initialize method does not (in either R or S-Plus).

Should that be changed?  Logically, I would say yes:  if the class
designer specified a validity method, it should not be possible to use
new() to create invalid objects.  But there is an efficiency penalty.

At the moment, you need to build your own initialize() method.  That's
not all bad--in the process you may also make the arguments to
initialize() reasonable names instead of ..., or otherwise get beyond
the notion of just supplying slot names in calls to new().

Here's a simple example (which I'll add to the initialize
documentation).  The validity method requires a single string for the
"id" slot.

setClass("a", representation(x="numeric", id = "character"),
         validity = function(object)
     if(length(object@id)==1) TRUE else 
     "Expected a single string as the \"id\" slot")

and the initialize method calls validObject.

setMethod("initialize", "a", function(.Object, x = numeric(), id =
"<>"){
  .Object@x <- x
  .Object@id <- id
   validObject(.Object)
  .Object})

With that definition, you get a check with new():

R> new("a", x=1:10, id=character())
Error in validObject(.Object) : Invalid "a" object: Expected a single
string as the "id" slot

[A couple of details for those interested.  The default values in the
initialize() method above are important.  Otherwise, simple calls such
as new("a") will fail.

Also, R (but not currently S-Plus) has a function callNextMethod() that
looks good for writing initialize methods.  It often is, but there is a
current bug that requires you to supply all the arguments to
callNextMethod in this case, contrary to the documentation.  With luck,
the bug will be fixed.  Meanwhile, the way to use callNextMethod in
initialize() is like this:

R> setMethod("initialize", "a", function(.Object, ...) {
+ x <- callNextMethod(.Object, ...)
+ validObject(x)
+ x})

]

Well, as someone might have said, it depends what you mean by "new".

The above mechanism pretty much ensures that objects will be valid when
created.

But it doesn't prevent some code from doing:
  x@id <- character(0)

So, one might define methods for "@<-" that included validity checking. 
Sometimes, though, (as in checking that two slots have the same length,
e.g.) it may take some care not to create invalid objects temporarily: 
the discipline of always creating the objects through a call to new()
will usually work, but once again with some slight efficiency penalty.

The whole area of valid objects is one that all of us interested folks
should discuss.

It would be nice to have some more "real" examples.

The build works fine if I use -flat_namespace -undefined suppress
for shlib_ldflags (which means R.bin and libR.dylib are still build
with two-level namespaces, but all the module and library foo.so
files have flat namespaces).

This should probably be the way to do it, and I'll try to find out what
goes on in a separate version of R-devel.

It may be possible to work around this from your end using R CMD COMPILE
first and then calling R CMD SHLIB only for the linking part.

Actually, if you have foo.c and foo.cc in the same dir and compile these
for linking into a shared library they would both compile into foo.o ...

Thanks very much to John and Robert for their very helpful replies. In the spirit
of John's last comment:

I've written an example of an initialize method for a new sparse matrix class matrix.coo.
The object simply contains the nonzero elements, their row and column indices and the
dimension of the matrix.  For most purposes we don't use this format, but it is especially
convenient for some subsetting tasks, and it is a bit simpler than the matrix.csr class.

I hope by offering this up for a critique it might help to clarify some remaining questions.

setClass("matrix.coo",representation(ra="numeric",
        ja="integer",ia="integer", dimension="integer"),
        validity = function(x) {
                if(!length(x@dimension) == 2 )
                        return("invalid dimension attribute")
                else{
                        nrow <- x@dimension[1]
                        ncol <- x@dimension[2]
                        }
                if(!(length(x@ra) ==length(x@ja) && length(x@ra) ==length(x@ia)))
                        return("ra,ja,ia don't have equal lengths")
                if(any(x@ja < 1) || any(x@ja > ncol))
                        return("ja exceeds dim bounds")
                if(any(x@ia < 1) || any(x@ia > nrow))
                        return("ia exceeds dim bounds")
                if(length(x@ra) < 1 || length(x@ra) > nrow*ncol)
                        return("ra has too few, or too many elements")
                TRUE})
setMethod("initialize", "matrix.coo",
        function(.Object, ra = numeric(0),  ja = integer(0),
                ia = integer(0),dimension = integer(0)) {
        .Object@ra <- ra
        .Object@ja <- ja
        .Object@ia <- ia
        .Object@dimension <- dimension
        validObject(.Object)
        .Object
       })

The use of validObject here is very convenient since some checking is handled
automatically, like checking for the integer form of the ja,ia, and dim
components.  I have no idea what the overhead cost is of doing this checking.

In SparseM most of the initialize calls will come from code in the package
that (presumably) knows what it is doing.  The motivation for my sudden
interest in validity checking was to control the impulse to construct sparse
objects "on the fly" that didn't conform.  Need I mention, that I've managed
to do this myself...  Efficiency, as usual, is probably not a paramount concern at this
stage,  but I'm little concerned that the efficiency cost is being imposed on
many automatic situations where I'm fairly sure that valid objects are being
made, and it may still not catch the few foolish attempts to make an object "on the
fly."

Greatly appreciate for any advice on the following. Many grateful thanks. Please

Error message :
"Error in model.frame.default(formula = Y ~ X4, data = TS, drop.unused.levels =

Actions taken :
debug(), traceback(), and looking into model.frame.default.

Situation : 
stepAIC() is used to select variables into a regression model by forward
selection procedure. This stepAIC() is programmed within a function where the
data.frame of the required data are defined and computed.

Problem : When I cut and paste the body of the function Q and run in the
workspace, it will give me the required output and the data.frame from gfit (T)
is passed into stepAIC() for the selection procedure. However when I execute the
same codes, but now through the function (Q(), see below), the above error
message appears.

The problem is that "debugger" gets an error when trying to
go into the dump.  I don't understand what is going on, but
it doesn't have to do with the actual names of the objects --
the same thing happens if all the names are changed.

This is precisely the same on Linux with 1.6.1 and Windows
with 1.6.2.

This is already fixed in the current stepAIC for R-devel, to be releases 
with R 1.7.0.

Subject: [Rd] Bug list summary (automatic post)
Message-ID: <200303210615.h2L6F4ws031295@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

..Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
..
..There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
..To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
..Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
..cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
..internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
..This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
..mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
..(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
..and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

Subject: [Rd] cumprod doesn't work with data frames (PR#2667)
Message-ID: <200303220041.h2M0fhn9023593@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Suppose you make a data-frame like so:

    xxx <- data.frame(a=10,b=20,c=30,d=40)

Then 

    cumprod(xxx[1,]) 

returns 

> cumprod(xxx[1,])
   a  b  c  d
1 10 20 30 40

The documentation for cumprod says that it should work on "numerical objects",
and this is a data-frame, but it seems like it ought to "do the right thing" in
this case.  If this is redundant, my apologies.

A data frame is not numerical: it can contain character, factor, list and
other variables.  It is `list-like'.  cumprod works column by column
via the group generic functions:

> xx <- data.frame(a=1:5, b=rep(1,5))
> xx
  a b
1 1 1
2 2 1
3 3 1
4 4 1
5 5 1
> cumprod(xx)
    a b
1   1 1
2   2 1
3   6 1
4  24 1
5 120 1

as intended.  See ?Arith (and there are data.frame methods for the Arith 
group generic).

In short; not a bug.

Hello, the documentation for POSIXct and POSIXlt
refers to the timezone keyword as "TZ".  The functions
expect "tz".

BTW, is this where errors/ bugs should be reported?

Cheers, Mike.

There are no functions POSIXct nor POSIXlt.  ?POSIXct sends you to the
help on the *class* "POSIXct", and that refers explicitly to the
*environment variable* TZ, not a `keyword', whatever that is.

There are functions as.POSIXct and as.POSIXlt expecting argument tz, and
that is how they are documented.

See the R FAQ.  But please, reports as confused as this one just divert 
the developers from real work.

I think you are referring to the Carbon version of R. Btw, it is not a 
bug.

In this case it is only a problem of the system because I do not force 
refreshing. You should have better results using the quartz() device.
What I mean is that plot is done but the window content is not 
refreshed unless you force it with some like par(ask=TRUE) which is NOT 
a good thing to do during simulations.

Dear colleague,

unfortunately 'rnorm' does not create normal distributed numbers as
you can see with following histogramm:

> hist(rnorm(1000000),breaks=100)

and 

> hist(pnorm(rnorm(1000000)),breaks=100)

I have done several chi^2-tests which have all failed:

> chi2unif<- function(x,N)

>    pchisq(chi2,N-1)
>  } 

> chi2unif(x<-pnorm(rnorm(1000000)),100)

The result is the p-value of a goodness of fit test (chisquare test).
It should be a uniform random number in [0,1].
However, if this test is repeated, one almost every time gets an
number near one (0.99...)

This problems happens only by using normal.kind="Kindermann-Ramage"
(the default). This bug also appears in all random variate generation
that depend on 'rnorm', like 'rgamma'.

Try R-devel, as this has already been changed (after several related 
reports).

Be aware though that *all* pseudo-random number generators have some 
deficiencies, and R does provide you with many other choices.

Subject: [Rd] predict (PR#2685)
Message-ID: <200303252329.h2PNTdn9024925@pubhealth.ku.dk>

There is a bug in `predict' whereby the order of variables sometimes gets
re-arranged compared to the original fit, and then disaster results.
Specifically, the 'variables' and 'predvars' attributes of a 'terms' object
get out of synch. This only happens when the terms in the original formula
get re-ordered during fitting:

test> scrunge.data_ data.frame( contin=1:10, discrete=factor( rep( c( 'cat',
'dog'), 5)), resp=runif( 10))
test> lm.ok_ lm( resp ~ discrete + contin %in% discrete, data=scrunge.data)
test> predict( lm.ok, scrunge.data) # no problemo
         1          2          3          4          5          6          7
8          9         10

0.85860886 0.81655736 1.12956963 

test> lm.bug_ lm( resp ~ contin %in% discrete + discrete, data=scrunge.data)
# terms will be re-ordered
test> predict( lm.bug, scrunge.data)
Error in "contrasts<-"(*tmp*, value = "contr.treatment") : 
        contrasts apply only to factors
In addition: Warning message: 
variable discrete is not a factor in: model.frame.default(object, data, xlev
= xlev) 

This actually turns out to be a bug in `model.frame.default', to do with an
inconsistency between `predvars' and `vars' when `model.frame.default' is
called inside `predict'. AFAICS it can be fixed by including the commented
line below in `model.frame.default':

    <<...>>
    vars <- attr(formula, "variables")
    predvars <- attr(formula, "predvars")
    if (is.null(predvars)) 
        predvars <- vars
    varnames <- as.character(predvars[-1]) # MVB: was vars[-1] not
predvars[-1]
    variables <- eval(predvars, data, env)
    <<...>>
    
This has the side-effect that there are some ugly column names in the
model.frame if e.g. a `poly' term is used, but doesn't actually seem to hurt
the prediction.

However, that doesn't fix it all. There is still a bug in `predict', even
after replacing `model.frame.default' with the above:

test> predict( lm.bug, scrunge.data)
Error in drop(X[, piv, drop = FALSE] %*% beta[piv]) : 
        subscript out of bounds
test> # wot???        

This time, the bug is in `delete.response', which call `terms' to set most
of the attributes including `variables', but adjusts the original `predvars'
by hand. Because `terms' returns the variables in a different order when
it's called by `predict.lm' to when it was originally called by `lm', things
get out of synch.

This is a slightly tricky bug to fix, because `predvars' and `variables' can
look a bit different e.g. if there are `poly' terms, but I think the
following change near the end of `delete.response' does the trick:
  
  <<...>>
  if (length(formula(termobj)) == 3) {
#   Old code, reliant on maintaining the order of terms: attr(tt,
"predvars") <- attr(termobj, "predvars")[-2]
    reorder <- match( sapply( attr( tt, 'variables'), deparse), sapply(
attr( termobj, 'variables'), deparse)) # MVB
    attr( tt, 'predvars') <- attr( termobj, 'predvars')[ reorder] # MVB
  }
  <<...>>
  
cheers

#       r-bugs@r-project.org

`predict' complains about new factor levels, even if the "new" levels are
merely levels in the original that didn't occur in the original fit and were
sensibly dropped, and that don't occur in the prediction data either. (At
least if `drop.unused.levels' was set to TRUE, which the default.)

test> scrunge.data.2_ data.frame( y=runif( 3), disc=factor( c( 'cat', 'dog',
'cat'), levels=c( 'cat', 'dog', 'earwig')))
test> lm.predbug.2_ lm( y~disc, data=scrunge.data.2)
test> predict(lm.predbug.2, newdata=scrunge.data.2)
Error in model.frame.default(object, data, xlev = xlev) : 
        factor disc has new level(s) earwig


A cure for this seems to be to add the commented line below towards the end
of `model.frame.default':

    <<...>>
    if (length(xlev) > 0) {
        for (nm in names(xlev)) if (!is.null(xl <- xlev[[nm]])) {
            xi <- data[[nm]]
            if (is.null(nxl <- levels(xi))) 
                warning(paste("variable", nm, "is not a factor"))
            else {
                xi <- xi[, drop = TRUE]
                nxl <- levels( xi) # MVB: remove droppees
                if (any(m <- is.na(match(nxl, xl)))) 
                  stop(paste("factor", nm, "has new level(s)", nxl[m]))
            }
        }
    }
    else if (drop.unused.levels) {
    <<...>>

`termplot' bombs if the original dataset contains NAs in the predictors,
even if these were ignored during fitting:

test> bug.data_ data.frame( x=c(1:3, NA), y=runif( 4))

Subject: [Rd] formal methods and classes and capitalization conventions 
Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.1.20030326124657.00b108b8@imaphost.wehi.edu.au>

Martin Maechler has suggested that I post this comment to r-devel. It was 
originally posted to bioconductor.

---------------------------------

I'd like to raise the issue of a capitalization convention for naming 
objects in R. Almost everything in R used to be lowercase but recently 
there is increasing use of mixed upper/lower case to define names. There is 
potential for using the capitalizations to make code more self explanatory, 
but only if a consistent system is used.

In Java, capitalization is used to indicate the type of object. Names of 
methods are capitalized except for the first word (e.g., geneNames), names 
of classes are fully capitalized (e.g., ExprSet), names of data objects are 
all lowercase, and names of libraries have their own conventions but 
normally with lowercase letters. A programmer can recognize the type of 
object in many cases simply from the name.

In R, Java capitalization has started to be used for formal generic 
functions, but the point of the convention is lost somewhat because the 
same capitalization is being used for classes, non-generic functions, 
package names and even function arguments. Naming is not always done 
consistently and different conventions seem to be used by different people, 
so within Bioconductor we have classes, functions, arguments, and packages 
with lots of different capitalization styles. One cannot predict what 
capitalization style will be used for a given object, so capitalization is 
on the way to becoming a complication rather than a clarification.

Here is a suggestion for a convention, which people can shoot down if they 
like:

New-style classes: full capitalization, e.g., ExprSet, AffyBatch, MarrayNorm
New-style generic functions: lower case first word, e.g., maNorm, 
normalize, rma, geneNames
Old-style generic functions: leave as they are
Non-generic functions: lowercase, with very sparing use of dot separaters
Members of data classes: lowercase, possibly with dot separaters
Function arguments: lowercase, possibly with dot separaters
Packages: lowercase, e.g., affy, marraynorm

I would be happy myself with almost any convention. What I am looking for 
are guidelines of good practice for a someone developing a new package 
which contains S4 generic functions as well as non-generic functions.

Cheers

summary.manova is missing a line that labels the "$SS$Residuals"

Here is the first few lines of output to show the problem

Note that it shows the label "$SS[[4]]" instead of the more useful
"$SS$Residuals".

The fix looks to me like the lines in summary.manova that currently read
    if (rdf > 0) {
        nt <- nterms + 1
        df[nt] <- rdf
        ss[[nt]] <- crossprod(resid)

You forgot to give the R version, platform etc.

This is already fixed in R-devel, and your example works there provided a
valid assignment operator is used.

It is the same PR#2206, and is marked as fixed in R-bugs.

This is intentional.  The coding for factors is based on the full set of 
levels, and should be comparable for different prediction sets.

If you are using factors with fictitious levels the fix is obvious: 
improve the design.

Actually, the default is FALSE: see args(model.frame.default).  lm and glm
call model.frame.default with non-default args.

Subject: [Rd] formal methods and classes and capitalization conventions
In-Reply-To: <5.2.0.9.1.20030326124657.00b108b8@imaphost.wehi.edu.au>

Many of us are waiting for _ to become available in names, probably a year 
from now (it will disappear as assignment in 1.8.0: three unreadable bug 
reports this morning show why).  Then other conventions become possible.

The convention you refer to is much older than Java: X11 resources have
similar conventions, and in the Microsoft world this is known as Hungarian 
notation, after Charles Simonyi.

Given that all object names in R are of variant type, type seems less of an 
issue.  (Functions can return different types depending on their arguments 
or even randomly, for example.)

I'm having difficulty with Rprof.  I have a documentation example test.qss that
runs fine without profiling, but under Rprof,

Error in standardGeneric("model.matrix") :

I tried this,  on my solaris "R version 1.7.0, 2003-02-05" but got complaints
about the use of env from make.  So I quickly retreated.  Any thoughts on this?

I've set up for daily distribution builds of the current development
version. These are available at 

    http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The current one is

    R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-26.tar.gz

(and it's pretty useless to wait for them to be mirrored elsewhere...)

Notice that these are made using "make dist" (like the final release
will be) and thus they may have problems that don't show up on CVS or
rsync checkouts (e.g. files missing).

You're encouraged to try them out and report errors if you find any.
In particular, we'd like you to do it if you have an "exotic"
hardware/software platform.

This version compiles and runs fine on Darwin 6.5 (OS X 10.2.5).

If I am using the native Tcl/Tk and BLAS/LAPACK in vecLib,
my configure sequence is

configure  
--with-tcl-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh  
--enable-R-shlib --without-x --with-blas='-framework vecLib'  
--with-lapack TCLTK_LIBS='-framework Tcl -framework Tk'  
TCLTK_CPPFLAGS='-I/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.Framework/Headers  
-I/Library/Frameworks/Tk.Framework/Headers'

while the more standard version, using Apple's X11 and fink's gnome, is

configure --with-tcl-config=/sw/lib/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/sw/lib/tkConfig.sh --enable-R-shlib --with-gnome

	optim control trace=-1 gives more output than trace=0 (PR#2691)

In optim, non-zero values of trace in the control list are treated as postitive,
even 
if they are negative.

>From documentation:

trace
Integer. If positive, tracing information on the progress of the optimization is
produced. Higher values may produce more tracing information: for method
"L-BFGS-B" there are six levels of tracing. (To understand exactly what these do
see the source code: higher levels give more detail.)

example:
obj <- function(par){sum(par)}
par <- c(1,1,1)
optim(par,obj,control=list(trace=-1))

Sorry-- glad it's fixed & surprised I left the info off-- it's in

I know that I searched the bug tracking page yesterday to see whether the
bugs were already reported before sending them. Didn't find anything
yesterday, but there they are today in black & white. Must have done
something daft.

There is still an inconsistency bug between `lm' and `predict.lm', though.
`lm' intentionally overlooks inactive levels of a factor, but `predict.lm'
doesn't, even when it legitimately could. In particular, it is a bit odd to
have no problem predicting without a `newdata' argument even when the
original data had inactive factor levels, but then to get an error if
`newdata=<<original data>>' is supplied explicitly! (See example.)

Given that the (IMHO sensible) decision to drop has been taken for `lm' to
drop inactive levels, deliberately so that users don't have to change their
designs when they don't really need to, then surely it's inconsistent for
`predict' not to do the same when it's statistically OK?

[When it's not OK-- i.e. when there are levels in the prediction data that
didn't appear in the fitting data-- the cleanest solution would perhaps be
for `predict' to return NA values and a warning, rather than an error. But
that's a separate issue.]

Slightly expanded example, and suggested fix to `model.frame.default':

test> scrunge.data.2_ data.frame( y=runif( 3), disc=factor( c( 'cat',
'dog','cat'), levels=c( 'cat', 'dog', 'earwig')))
test> lm.predbug.2_ lm( y~disc, data=scrunge.data.2)

test> predict( lm.predbug.2) # uses original data
         1         2         3 
 0.2185388 0.5843139 0.2185388 

test> predict(lm.predbug.2, newdata=scrunge.data.2) # newdata = original
data
Error in model.frame.default(object, data, xlev = xlev) : 
        factor disc has new level(s) earwig


A cure for this seems to be to add the commented line below, towards the end
of `model.frame.default':

    <<...>>
    if (length(xlev) > 0) {
        for (nm in names(xlev)) if (!is.null(xl <- xlev[[nm]])) {
            xi <- data[[nm]]
            if (is.null(nxl <- levels(xi))) 
                warning(paste("variable", nm, "is not a factor"))
            else {
                xi <- xi[, drop = TRUE]
                nxl <- levels( xi) # MVB: remove droppees
                if (any(m <- is.na(match(nxl, xl)))) 
                  stop(paste("factor", nm, "has new level(s)", nxl[m]))
            }

Confirmed Roger's finding on RH 8.0, otherwise it compiles fine.

As an aside, RH 9 to be called 'Shrike', (curiously skipping 8.1 due to 
binary incompatibility issues) will be available on March 31 to paid RHN 
subscribers. It will be available a week later to all folks.

Folks doing development may want to be aware, if not already, of the 
change in the threading approach used in RH 9 which will go to the 
Native POSIX Threads Library. Some very brief information on the change 
and possible application related problems is available here:

https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/phoebe-list/2003-March/004919.html

There is also a white paper here:

http://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl-design.pdf

I raise this in case this might in any way affect anyone's development 
considerations.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Only if an argument is set, and originally lm did not do so.

Read again.  predict.lm is consistent across its inputs: unlike lm it can
take variable `newdata'.  As I said the intention is to be consistent
across *prediction sets*.  Omitting newdata is not giving a prediction
set.

That comes from

cvs log ./share/perl/massage-Examples.pl
...
revision 1.15
date: 2003/03/26 20:12:56; 
Redefine T/F to something more useful than NULL.
...

which made it an error to get("F"), alhough that is a legitimate operation 
(it is assuming the value is FALSE that is the problem).  (get("T") would 
have failed too.)

Perhaps we need to delay putting out betas for a day after feature freeze 
to allow us to test the frozen version.

Martyn Plummer has already mentioned this and that he will be testing it
before release.

I don't think anything in Linux R uses threads, and we have problems with 
e.g. threaded ATLAS that suggest that threads are unsafe: see the R-admin 
manual.

Hmm: does it say what happens for negative values?  I don't think so.

If you use undocumented values of an argument you should expect surprises.
What happens depends on the method argument, BTW.

I've added a warning to read the documentation if trace < 0 is

OK...I must have missed that post. Apologies.

I will be downloading the RH 9 ISO's early as a paid RHN subscriber, so 
if there is anything that I can do to help Martyn in validating or 
confirming any issues, let me know. I have cc'd Martyn on this post.

The current code snippet in panel.stripplot is:

else panel.superpose(x = x.jitter, y = y.jitter, ...)

Because groups is passed as a function argument in panel.stripplot and is not

else panel.superpose(x = x.jitter, y = y.jitter, groups=groups, ...)

Hi everyone,

As "intensities" is deprecated as a synonym for "density" in the
output of hist it would be a good idea to replace its occurence with
"density" in plot.histogram, where we currently have

    y <- if (freq) 
        x$counts
    else x$intensities

Note that, to add to the confusion, x$density is also referred to in
plot.histogram.

Cheers, Jonathan.

Dear R-devel:

This might have been discussed, but I've deleted all the messages,
unfortunately.

I downloaded the 1.7.0beta 03/26/2003.  The compile was fine, but make check
failed while checking "base".  base-Ex.Rout.fail has the following:

> ## find the 10 largest objects in base
> z <- sapply(ls("package:base"), function(x) object.size(get(x)))
Error in get(x) : F used instead of FALSE
Execution halted

This is on Mandrake 9.0 running on PIII Xeon.  Same thing happened with GCC
and the Intel compilers.

Can anyone help?

Regards,
Andy

There was a late change to massage-Examples.pl that broke this for
everyone (and was probably not spotted as the *-Ex.R files were not 
remade automatically).  Hopefully we will have a working version for the 
next beta: I am just doing a build from scratch to test this out.

Yes, it's been discussed, and fixed. It's to do with attempts to give a
better error message when T/F are used instead of TRUE/FALSE. Thanks for
the report.

Right. Will be fixed in R 1.7.0.

Dear R-devel,

I grabbed 1.7.0 beta from today.  "make check" still fails at base-Ex.R.
The last few lines of the output are:

> lsf.str()#- how do the functions look like which I am using?
Error in exists(nam <- nms[i], envir = envir, mode = mode) : 
        F used instead of FALSE
Execution halted

Looks like the same problem as before, but at a different place.

Mandrake Linux 9.0 with gcc.

Regards,
Andy

When exactly was that beta snapshot?  It is the same problem, and the fix
was committed at

...and the betas are being made shortly after 07:00 (both in Wisconsin
time I assume), i.e. about 3 hours ago. 

Also, did you rebuild from scratch? The examples might not be getting
correctly rebuilt otherwise.

That's yesterday's snapshot.  Today's is now up

R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-28.tar.gz    28-Mar-2003 07:02   8.8M 

As Peter says, that is in Wisconsin time, but the CVS records are in GMT.

Hmmm... Just went to CRAN (main site) and couldn't find that file:

$ ncftpget
ftp://ftp.cran.r-project.org/pub/R/src/base/R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-28.tar.gz
ncftpget: server said: R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-28.tar.gz: No such file or

I wiped the old stuff clean with rm -rf R-1.7.0*, so as to leave no chance
of contamination.

Andy

The original message said to use cran.us.r-project.org:

I've set up for daily distribution builds of the current development
version. These are available at

    http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The current one is

    R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-26.tar.gz

(and it's pretty useless to wait for them to be mirrored elsewhere...)

You need to use the cran.us.r-project.org site (HTTP only) or suffer
mirroring delays.

Subject: [Rd] R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-28 Could not create DVI version
Message-ID: <3E848FD4.3277ED22@bank-banque-canada.ca>

With this morning's build (R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-28.tar.gz from
<http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/> ) I get make check to work on
Solaris 5.8 with gcc 2.95.2 and on Mandrake 9.0.

For my own packages, on Solaris "R CMD build" is generating a tarball
but when I "R CMD check" it I get 

...
* checking package vignettes in 'inst/doc' ... OK
* creating setRNG-manual.tex ... OK
* checking setRNG-manual.tex ... ERROR
Could not create DVI version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.


This works on Mandrake and on Solaris the Rd files pass all the checks I
do before building the tarball, so I doubt it is the Rd files. more
likely it is a defective version of some latex tool. Any suggestions?

Dear R-project,

I am having difficulty compiling R for my unix machine.  Attached is the 
config.log file that has all the necessary info.  Can you help?

Thank you.

Subject: [Rd] compling errors for sun unix (PR#2702)
In-Reply-To: <200303281918.h2SJI4n9028570@pubhealth.ku.dk>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303291552270.9132-100000@gannet.stats>

1) This is not a bug, and you did not even attach the file correctly.
The output on the console told you what the error (your error) was,
and it would have wasted less time to have sent that.

The place to ask for help is R-help: R-bugs is for BUGS as defined in the 
FAQ.  Inadequate compilation environments are not bugs in R, especially 
when they give such explicit error messages.

2) You seem to be using gcc 2.8.1, and do not have the compatible Fortran 
compiler.  Please seek a competent local advisor to help you with your 
Solaris education.  A less ancient version of gcc (like 2.95.3 or 3.2)
does work on Solaris 2.7 (2.6 being pretty ancient too).

Note, that is not the version of g77 compatible with gcc 2.8.1, and it is
explicitly `experimental'!

That probably means you don't have /usr/local/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, 
or otherwise your compilers are not installed properly.

That's very explicit.

This is now being changed  such that plot.histogram() will still

Message-ID: <3E85CE2F.5040809@statistik.uni-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I'm just compiling R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-29.tar.gz on WinNT 4.0:

the installation of package grid fails (at least the build of help files):

---------- Making package grid ------------
   installing inst files
   adding build stamp to DESCRIPTION
   making DLL ...
   ... DLL made
   installing R files
   installing man source files
   installing indices
Error in !.listFilesWithType(vignetteDir, "vignette") :
         invalid argument type
Execution halted
make[1]: *** [indices] Error 1
make: *** [pkg-grid] Error 2
*** Installation of grid failed ***


Is this known or is it worth to debug?


BTW:
The following warning messages appear for package methods (expected???):

Yes, but it *had* been fixed, and I've just encountered it again.
So I will be debugging it.  The problem is that grid installs a PDF file 
in doc which is not a vignette.

Yes, long been there.

in tools/admin.R it should be

.installPackageVignetteIndex <-
function(dir, outDir)
{
    vignetteDir <- file.path(dir, "inst", "doc")
    ## Create a vignette index only if the vignette dir exists and
    ## really contains vignettes.
    if(!.fileTest("-d", vignetteDir)) return()
    if(!length(.listFilesWithType(vignetteDir, "vignette"))) return()
        ^^^^^^^                                           ^ 

The result of .listFilesWithType is a character string,
so this would never work: under Unix the result of the R invocation was
never tested.

Subject: [Rd] wishlist: add log argument to stripchart (PR#2710)
Message-ID: <200303302032.h2UKWKn9009445@pubhealth.ku.dk>


I frequently use stripchart to summarise data.  Recently I wished to
plot a stripchart on a log scale, so modified stripchart locally.  The
change is small, just adding log="" to the function call and
then changing line 42 of src/library/base/R/stripchart.R from:

    plot(xlim, ylim, type="n", ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE)

to: 

    plot(xlim, ylim, type="n", ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE, log=log)

Could I request this be added?  If so, I'd be happy to send a patch
for the .R and .Rd files.  boxplot() already offers the log argument,
so I hope this is a reasonable and useful request.

Message-ID: <3E872FD2.20664.1B69940@localhost>

Hola!

I'm trying to make r-devel on windows XP. I downloaded an hour ago
R-1.7.0beta_2003-03-30.tar.gz
make terminates without any error messages, with 
make check I get error messages from tests of internet and 
socket functions, surely because my modem was not 
connected (It doesn't say in the documentation (file INSTALL)
that internet must be connected under make check.)

But the file base-Ex.Rout has as last line
quit('no'), which I take to mean the rest of the checks went 
well?

make in directory \bitmap went without error messages, 
(but I had to say just make and not make bitmapdll as INSTALL says.)

Then, after installing the files from R_Tcl.zip using unzip from the 
tools collection:

C:\R\R17beta\R-1.7.0\src\gnuwin32>make tcl

Then
make check-recommended

runs without giving any errors.

Then

make docs

handle<0x7D8> for pid 0, Win32 error 6

with some similar errors later, but the pdf docs seem to 
build correctly

Because of the problems (most serious Tcl) I did'nt try
to build the installers.

One other "problem":  INSTALL says that, among othres, 
 hhc.exe needs to be in the path. I don't have it in the path, and 
more, does'nt know what it is or what it is supposed to do. 
Can this be cause of some of the problems above?

Kjetil,

You are sending a long report about your inexperience: most of this is no
different from the last few R versions.  We *do* actually check that
R-devel builds on Windows during feature freeze, so please start with the
assumption that problems are with your installation or mis-reading of the
instructions.

And you only get warnings, not actual errors, BTW, so the Internet does
*not* need to be connected!  And make check does finish, I bet.

No, it means base checked correctly: it is the first check, not the last 
one.

INSTALL says to do make bitmapdll in src/gnuwin32, not in bitmap, and 
bitmap/INSTALL says to do make.  As in:

    If everything is set up in directory bitmap,

    	make bitmapdll

    will work from this directory.
    	      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    
Both pieces of documentation are correct, but your assertions are not.

The files mentioned as not found *are* in Tcl/include in that zip file.  
Please compare C:/R/R17beta/R-1.7.0/Tcl with the contents of the zip file
(and perhaps compare the zip file with that on the master site).

Yes.  We are not responsible for the infelicities in contributed packages.

That's a problem with resources on your specific system.

It is part of HTML Help Workshop.  You can't build CHM help without it,
so I suspect it must be in your path.

Perhaps, but make check tells you:
"running tests of Internet and socket functions ...
   expect some differences"

So you have to be more explicit here ...

Interesting:
The httpget() part hangs on my machine. I'll look closer later this day 
or tomorrow...

"make bitmapdll" in ...\src\gnuwin32 or "make" in ...\src\gnuwin32\bitmap.

You have to unzip it in ...\R-1.7.0 , *not* in ...\src\gnuwin32 or 
anywhere else.

hhc.exe is from Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop (see INSTALL for details

You cannot build *.chm help files without it.

I've recently updated from an early February version of 1.7.0 to

Version 1.7.0 Under development (unstable) (2003-03-25)

and am now having problems with errors giving the message:

  ' getExtends(ClassDef) : @ must be used on an object with a formal class'

which seems to be caused by 'setIs("character","character or NULL")'
which attempts to define 'character' as an extension of the virtual
class 'character or NULL' defined in 'setClass("character or NULL")'.
If I try this:

> library(methods)
> setClass("CN")
[1] "CN"
> setIs("NULL","CN")
> setIs("numeric","CN")
> setIs("character","CN")
Error in getExtends(ClassDef) : @ must be used on an object with a formal class

The fact that 'setIs("numeric","CN")' and 'setIs("NULL","CN")' work just fine
leads me to believe that this is a bug in the new R-devel version.

That's not the current version you are using, and it does work in the
current version.

However, that was caused by an additional consistency check, so I believe
it revealed a bug in the older version that we have not yet tracked down
(but have turned the check off).

OK. I got it. The httpget() part in .../test/internet.R of make check 
hung on my machine for a simple reason:
A software called WebWasher 3.3 obviously blocked that connection ...
Sorry for any confusion.

Thanks, I've now updated again and this mornings problem is now ok.
But I'm still having trouble with installing the current version of
SparseM.  Both of the setMethod calls

setMethod("%*%",signature(x="matrix",y="matrix.csr"),.matmul.matrix.csr)
setMethod("%*%",signature(x="numeric",y="matrix.csr"),.matmul.matrix.csr)

generate errors like this:

Error in setMethod("%*%", signature(x = "matrix", y = "matrix.csr"), .matmul.matrix.csr) :
        The method for function "%*%" and signature x="matrix", y="matrix.csr"
		is sealed and cannot be re-defined
Execution halted

Is there some other way for us to handle such cases, or is this too aggressive behavior
on the part of setMethod?

It would be great if the man page had examples for each of the commands.

I've got R installed, but

info R

brings up the page for the GNU regular expression library. Any chance of 
having a complete set of man pages?

Plain text documentation is good. I don't use Latex, and no one I know 
uses it.

Thanks for a great package!

It's a (sort of trivial) bug in isSealedMethod, called by setMethod,
arising because "%*%" doesn't belong to group "Ops" (unlike "+", etc.)
so the check for sealed methods only looks as the first arg.  See the
definition of function isSealedMethod for what's going on.

It's trivial to fix directly (& I will) but there is a question whether
"%*%" and relatives should have a new group of their own.  Seems
plausible?

There's plain text help from within R, and the R html help can be read
quite easily with lynx.

There *is* plaintext help for each command. Two thousand one hundred
and ten files of it as of last count, albeit not in info format, but
as text, html, and latex. For the same reason, the refman is not an
info document but available in .dvi and .pdf formats. However, we
might consider building one of the other documents in the manual
collection (which are written in texinfo) in info format and put it
into the info tree for info-afficionados.

[As for not using LaTeX: Your loss, especially when dealing with
mathematically oriented software...]

We already do this if the right tools are available at build time, and the
man page describes how to read it.

Umm, we do exactly that, the make targets are

make info
make install-info

E.g., typing "info R-intro" in a shell does the expected on my box ...

Oops, so we do...

We might want to install an R.info.gz as a link (if possible) to one
of the others to avoid the effect described. [Why does it find Regex
rather than (say) Readline, I wonder?]

BTW, at least on my installation, "info R-intro" works without the -f
stated on the man page. -f suggests that you need to know the
whereabouts of the info file, so is somewhat misleading.

Fritz, Peter,
Thanks for the notes. After learning that I needed to to R -CMD INSTALL 
I also found all kinds of docs. Very nice.

I was confused by multtest_1.0.tar.gz because I mistakenly un-tar'ed it 
and didn't find an INSTALL or README which I tend to think of as *nix 
standards.

I also looked in the ./inst/doc directory of the un-tar'ed tree. Nothing 
too useful looking there. I tried the PDF, and xpdf barfed. Of course, 
now I've read through the installation FAQ at the web site, and I know 
that it only takes one simple command to install the package.

Thanks again,
Tom.
