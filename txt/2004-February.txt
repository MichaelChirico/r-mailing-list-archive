Subject: [Rd] Naming difference in cbind between
 S-Plus (PR#6515)
Message-ID: <7491b3c7.b05083c.8205a00@po-a.temple.edu>

I see valid reasons and will therefore adopt the defensive coding practice:
  abc <- cbind(abc, d=abc$y - predict.lm(abc.lm, type="terms")[,1])
which works the same in both S-Plus and R and gives the answer I want.

The result of predict.lm is not a data.frame.
It is a "structure" in S-Plus and a "matrix" in R.

S-Plus gives
> M <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames=list(NULL, c('a', 'b')))
> cbind(c=5:6,d=M)
     c a b 
[1,] 5 1 3
[2,] 6 2 4



On spelling of the name S-Plus or S-PLUS, both are correct.
I normally write in LaTeX, so I normally use {\sc S-Plus}.

First, from the literature,
the Proprietary Notice on the copyright page of the July 2001 printed
edition says
      {\sc S-Plus} 6 for Windows User's Guide

Most of the internal uses of the word in the book are also in
smallcaps {\sc S-Plus}.  The outside cover does say S-PLUS.  The title
page says {\sc S-Plus}.

Second, by personal discussion,
I discussed this spelling with Tim Hesterberg about a year ago.
He told me that S-Plus is an appropriate spelling.

Third, by gestalt,
"S-PLUS" looks like the "PLUS" is the most important part---simply because
it occupies more space.
"S-Plus" looks like the "S" is the most important part---because the "S" is
full size and the "Plus" is typographically subsidiary.

Subject: [Rd] error in building R-1.9.0 sources under Win32
Message-ID: <401C5242.7020905@stat.ufl.edu>

I am trying to compile the R-dev sources on WinXP using mingw 3.1.0-1 
and fpTeX 0.7. In the past I
have been able to build the sources fine but now I receive an error in 
the process that I havent seen reported on the list before. Everything 
works fine until I get to 'make docs'. I now get the message below while 
building the R-admin manual (refman.pdf builds fine) and the make 
process quits. The error message this has to do with txi-en.tex so I put 
txi-en.tex in path_to_tex/texmf/tex/texinfo where I believe it should be 
(the full installation of fpTeX did not come with this file). 'make 
distribution' also fails with the same error message. Any thoughts on 
what is going wrong here?

Subject: [Rd] bzfile() in R
Message-ID: <401C5841.5090500@jhsph.edu>

I'm putting together a data package and am finding that I get 
enormous savings in space by using bzip instead of the usual gzip 
in save().  Is it safe to assume that for R versions, say >= 
1.7.1, that the function bzfile() will always be available?

Thanks,

I don't think that is correct as this an optional compile-team feature.

help(bzfile) says it 'may' be present whereas gzfile is guaranted (from a
1.9.0 snapshot):

     All platforms support (gz)file connections and 'url("file://")'
     connections.  The other types may be partially implemented or not
     implemented at all.  (They do work on most Unix platforms, and all
     but 'fifo' on Windows.)
		    
but then goes on to say under See Also:

     'capabilities' to see if 'gzfile', 'url', 'fifo' and
     'socketConnection' are supported by this build of R.

which suggests that even gzfile may not be guaranteed.

You could of course test via capabilities() and abort with a clear error.

Yes, that's true, but I was under the impression that since the 
bzip2 sources are included with the R sources, that the bzip2 
capability is always compiled in (either using the included 
sources or a system library).  Also, the NEWS file for 1.9.0 says:

     o   configure no longer lists bzip2 and PCRE as `additional
         capabilities' as all builds of R have had them since 		 
1.7.0.

Roger is correct.  Capabilities has not been changed, since earlier 
versions did not have bzfile (and even earlier ones did not have gzfile).

First, 1.9.0 is not released ... so I presume you mean R-devel.  Which 
date?

Did you remake your fptex databases (texhash) after adding the file?  It
is an TeX problem, not an R one.   You may find it simpler to put the file 
in .../doc/manual or .../share/texmf.

I've added it to the distribution, since people are using

@documentlanguage en

in .texi files (even though that appears to be the default according to
txi-en.tex).

Message-ID: <20040202092928.A9B40EFC2@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

I believe you are right, but can you please explain why anyone would want 
to fit this model?  It differs only in the coding from 

aov(y ~ a + b + Error(c), data=test.df)

and merely lumps together the top two strata.

There is a much simpler fix: in the line

        if(intercept) nmstrata <- c("(Intercept)", nmstrata)

remove the condition (and drop the empty stratum later if you want).

When analysing data from mixture designs, the variables add up to a
constant, and it is often preferrable to fit models without intercept
term.  We often have experiments where a mixture design (typically raw
materials) is combined with a factorial design (typically process
settings), and these are often modelled as the product of a
polynomial in the mixture components (without intercept) and a
polynomial in the factorial components.(*)

More often than not, either the raw materials or the process settings
cannot be completely randomised, leading to models with error terms.
It is also quite common that the experiment has to be run over several
days, leading to an error term for day.

You are right.  I didn't see that one.


---
(*) In these models, we have to manually code the factorial terms into
continuous variables, in order to circumvent the coding logic in
model.matrix() (when there is no intercept term, the first factor is
coded as dummy variables, one variable per level of the factor,
which makes these models overparametrised), but that is perhaps a
different story. :-)

Subject: [Rd] Wondering about behavior of function as? methods package
Message-ID: <200402021647540129.016EE2AB@harry.molgen.mpg.de>

Hi!

I wondering about the behavior of the 'as'  function.

After reading the following sentences:

?as:
    Returns the version of this object coerced to be the given Class.
and page 285 of programming with data:
"When a class extends another class, a call to as on the ...
Specially page 292
"If tx is an object of a class that extends matrix,
as(tx,"matrix")
extracts the portion of its representation forming the included matrix object."

I would expect that as(tmp,"list") in the example below will extract the list part of trackList together with the names attributes of the list.

setClass("trackList"
         ,representation(info="character")
         ,contains="list")

tmp<-new("trackList",list(a=c(1,1),b=c(2,3,4),d=c("u","v","w")))

 as(tmp,"list")
[[1]]
[1] 1 1

[[2]]
[1] 2 3 4

[[3]]
[1] "u" "v" "w"

Where the names attributes are gone?

On the other hand a call to as(tm,"matrix") as in the next example keeps the names attribute of the matrix.

setClass("trackMatrix"
         ,representation(info="character")
         ,contains="matrix")
tmp<-matrix(1:9,3)
rownames(tmp)<-c("a","b","c")
colnames(tmp)<-c(1:3)
tm<-new("trackMatrix",tmp)
as(tm,"matrix")

Is this behaviour intended (if so why) or is it a bug?

Sincerely
Eryk

This is a completely fresh R install. I'm trying to use Design package. Every
time I run the first example for psm() I'm getting an error <<couldn't find
function "survreg.fit">>.  However, survreg.fit does exists in the search path.
Is there something I can do to fix this?

Thanks a lot,

Oleg

 Running example for psm()

No, survreg.fit doesn't exist in the search path.  The survival package
does.

You have incompatible versions of survival and Design.  The most recent
version of survival for 1.8.x doesn't export survreg.fit, so it needs a
version of Design that references it as survival:::survreg.fit. I think
you need either a newer version of Design or an older version of survival
(or you can define
  survreg.fit<-survival:::survreg.fit
as a work-around)

This problem goes away with the version of survival for R-devel, which
does export survreg.fit (and survfit.km), at Frank Harrell's request.

You may find some value in looking at the Java distribution library that I
created a couple of years ago by porting the R distribution functions:

http://statdistlib.sourceforge.net/

A separate java implementation of the basic distribution classes is included
as part of the Hydra package for MCMC,

I would recommend giving more descriptive names to the methods.  In
particular would recommend 'pdf', 'cdf', 'quantile', and 'random' instead of
simply 'p', 'd', 'q', 'r' so that the expressions are very clear.

It is not at all clear to me what an 'AbscontDistribution' is.  Perhaps you
are referring to a continuous distribution?

You may also want to consider how to deal with multivariate distributions.

Yes this is very interesting, particularly if you extend it to handle
multivariate distributions.  

Good luck!

Absolutely continuous. This is slightly more restrictive than just
having a continuous distribution function, effectively meaning that
the density can be defined (with respect to Lebesgue measure on some
interval, usually).

Counterexamples are pathological, the sort of thing you challenge 2nd
year math/stat students to think up, but I can't say that I can
remember what they'd look like.

That's the most common 1-dimensional singular distribution, but higher
dimensional distributions are much more commonly singular.  For
example, mixed continuous-discrete distributions, and other
distributions whose support is of lower dimension than the sample
space, e.g. X ~ N(0,1), Y=X.

I don't think that qualifies as continuous, does it? Not in the sense
that the distribution function is continuous, surely. 

The Cantor distribution is the one that has the "devils staircase" as
distribution function, right? Continuous, differentiable almost
everywhere but the derivative is always 0. (Take an interval, divide
in three, let F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(x)=.5 on the middle third, and
define the outer thirds recursively.)

The most common 1d singular distribution is probably a lifetime with an
atom at zero.

I think the question was about a continuous but not absolutely continuous
distribution, and indeed the Cantor distribution is the standard example
in theory courses.

Yes, for my second example the 2-d distribution function is
continuous, because there are no atoms:

F(x,y) = P(X <= x, Y <= y) = Phi(min(x,y))

I was wrong about the mixed case; sorry.

We differ in notation.  I wouldn't call that one singular; I'd call it
mixed continuous and discrete, because the distribution function is a
sum of an absolutely continuous function and a step function.  But in
the measure theory sense, it's singular w.r.t. Lebesgue measure.

We have looked up these references with interest;

on the one hand, JAVA seems even more appropriate to our approach
with its concept of private/public interfaces, and on first glance, the 
way we
attach functions as slots to objects seems to be more-JAVA/C++ -like
than conformal to the S4 concept,

but we wanted to stay  *within* R to facilitate the use for the common 
R-user
and to have available the full power of  S in syntax and R as to computing.

We have inveseted some time into the decision how to implement the 
methods that
we call "constitutive", i.e. r,d,p,q --- as slots as we did it or as 
methods in the common
S4-concept. The main reason for our decision was:

Our classes are sort of "closed" under *(almost) arbitrary* 
transformations ---
the result of a transformation being again *one* new distribtion that  
only has be created
*once* for each transformation.

In particular, once the slots r,d,p,q is filled by an assignement of the
kind Z= X+Y [or any other transformation of distributions implemented],
in our solution, you can call d(Z)(x) which is the accessor function for 
slot d
of Z returning a function which is then evaluated at x [or r,p,q]
arbitrarily often for different arguments x without redefining d.

Within the S4-concept, however,  as far as we understand it, you would 
probably
have to create a new class for each sort of transformation, e.g.
"ConvolutedDistribution",  and  corresponding methods r,d,p,q for this class
which would then be called by the method dispatcher.
But
+ either an object Z of class "ConvolutedDistribution" would not know 
how to produce
r,d,p,q a priori, and for any call d(Z,x) convolution would have to be 
redone, which would not
be effective,
+ or any object Z which results from the assignement Z=X+Y would have to
produce a new class [and corresponding derived methods....]!

This is what we meant when calling r,d,p,q "constitutive" for a

[At least we would like to call in some *real* experts in this domain.]
Anyway, our class concept is open and we have already thought of such an

Since the argment of close.screen is supposed to be a single screen 
number, and

> scr
[1] 5 6

this appears to be user error, correctly detected.

Right, sorry. I had it mixed up with a mental image of the conditional
distributions of Y given X or vice versa, which of course jump
discontinuously from 0 to 1.

I do not mean to give statistical advice to any of the cited contributors,
who will all be familiar with this, but I might add that by iterated use
of the Lebesgue decomposition,
 
cf       http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LebesgueDecomposition.html

you may decompose any measure on the 1d Borel sets uniquely
into a discrete, an absolutely coninuous and a singular part.

Using this nomenclatura, Prof. Ripley's lifetime example would have
non-trivial discrete and  absolutely continuous parts  but only a 
trivial singular part.

In dimension d>1 things may become more complicated, though, as you 
might want to
distinguish the dimensions of sets on which [ Lebesgue^d and discrete] - 
singular parts
throw their mass....

Subject: [Rd] Scoping bug in ftable() (PR#6541)
Message-ID: <20040204183230.F3CFCEDDF@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

This bug shows up in ftable() in both r-patched and r-devel:

> x <- c(1,2)
> y <- c(1,2)
> z <- c(1,1)
> ftable(z,y)
  y 1 2
z      
1   1 1
> ftable(z,x)
  x 1
z    
1   2

Since x and y are identical, the two ftable results should be the
same, but they are not.  

I've only been able to see this when the column variable is named "x",
so it looks like a scoping problem in ftable.default.  I think the
problem is in this line:

x <- do.call("table", c(as.list(substitute(list(...)))[-1],
list(exclude = exclude)))

I think this call is finding the local variable "x" (which has been
used before this line) instead of the argument "x" and thus produces
an incorrect result.

How should this be fixed?  What we want is to convert "..." into an
evaluated list that includes the deparsed arguments as names.  Just
plain list(...) loses the names.

I think this works:

args <- list(...)
names(args) <-
as.character(unlist(as.list(substitute(list(...)))))[-1]
x <- do.call("table", args)

but isn't there an easier way?

Message-ID: <200402041415.05423.deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>


With today's r-devel, help(seq) says:

     The last generates the sequence '1, 2', ..., 'length(along)',
     unless the argument is of length 1 when it is interpreted as a
     'length' argument.

referring to the usage 

     seq(along)

This is not true for 0:

> seq(0)
[1] 1 0
> seq(length = 0)
numeric(0)

I'm not sure what the intended behaviour of seq(0) is, but either seq() or the 
help page should be fixed.

Also, the exception (naturally) holds only for _numeric_ arguments of length 
1.

There are no concrete plans that I know of for making additions to the 
hard-coded list of device procedures in the NewDevDesc struct in the 
near future.

Some of us have talked about providing an extension mechanism so that it 
is possible for third-party code to add to the list of device procedures 
(without having to recompile R), but are only at the stage of deciding 
that this would be a nice thing to do.

I decided there might not be, and committed a solution based on that,
so the bug no longer exists in r-devel (but maybe a new one does).

The knee-jerk reflex on seeing substitute() with ... or formal
arguments is that you need eval.parent somewhere since the names or
expressions passed to a function usually make better sense to the
parent than they do to the current function.

Not sure there is.

The fact that the original code did something close to what was
intended is due to what I still think is a design flaw in do.call
(though others disagree): It does an eval of it's arguents (on top of
what ordinary function calling does to evaluate the expression
producing the argument list).  This is why there is no explicit eval
around the substitute.  It is also why do.call isn't useful when some
elements of the argument list are symbols or expressions.

A much simpler way that probably does what was originally intended is
this:

 x <- table(..., exclude=exclude)

This works fine on the example I posted.  Where it differs from my
solution is when expressions are passed:

It gives

> x <- 1:2
> y <- 3:4
> ftable(x+1, y+1)
   4 5
      
2  1 0
3  0 1

whereas the current r-devel code gives

> ftable(x+1, y+1)
      y + 1 4 5
x + 1          
2           1 0
3           0 1

I like the new behaviour better, so I'll leave the complicated version
in place.

Nor am I, but it seems S documents the behaviour as 1:from, so I guess 
that is intended.

I've altered the help page.

Of course I longer recall the details but I think what I tried was
essentially to do table(..., exclude = exclude) in a way that would use
the table() heuristics for getting dimnames as if table() had been
called directly (rather than via ftable()).

Now the problem in what we currently have is that in the above:

R> x <- 1:2
R> y <- 3:4
R> ftable(z = x+1, y)
      y 3 4
x + 1      
2       1 0
3       0 1

and the first one should definitely be 'z' ... at least, according to my
original intentions :-)

And of course, pls note that we have

R> table(z=x+1, y+1)
   
z   4 5
  2 1 0
  3 0 1

in both r-release and r-devel so perhaps this is the problem we need to
fix first ...

Ok.
The glx device is pretty advanced with  the 2D stuff and I'm thinking 
about the 3D stuff.

In a first time I would replace coordinates parameters with a list which 
hold the coordinates.
To be less intrusive I'm going to clone old procedures in new one with 
this coordinates list.

I'll keep you informed about this device,

Subject: [Rd] Rejoinder: request for comments --- package "distr" --- S4
 Classes for Distributions
Message-ID: <4023C97B.80706@uni-bayreuth.de>

Hello,

this is kind of a rejoinder to our posting to r-devel
"request for comments --- package "distr" --- S4 Classes for Distributions"
dating from 01-31-04/ 05:11:50 EST./

To start, we want to thank the contributors of comments and suggestions,
which have been quite helpful to us.

Also, we want to apologize for being somewhat lengthy in our replies;
we hope you could cope with this.

Some specific questions emerged from this discussion:

(1) Naming of "private" slots: 
We agree with a proposal by Duncan Murdoch
[off-list] to use longer names in order to inhibit misuse of the @-operator

(2) Naming of the accesors r,d,p,q:
We tentatively would keep our naming as it makes apparent their origin.

(3) Question of functions as slots:
We hope to have convinced you that our solution has some advantages
in connection with transformations of distributions.

(4) Redundant saving of values of slots
(in case of the parameter of  a distribution --- a topic mentioned
by Duncan Murdoch [off-list]):

YES we do have some redundant saving of values.
BUT if inspection / modification of slots is done only by accessor/
replacement functions we take care of consistency.
We admit a certain inefficiency in that we replace the whole object
(including the validity check) when modifying parameter slots;
--- it just seemed much easier to realize and on the other hand, as
no too large structures are part of a distribution object, we see
this inefficiency only as a minor disadvantage.

(5) Multivariate distributions
They could easily be included to our package, but haven't been yet
--- we simply do not consider ourselves experts enough to do this job.

It would be nice if you could let us know your opinion / some suggestions
to these issues.

Thank you once again for your attention.

I have a data frame with some columns being logical.
I wanted to calculate a column that is an AND combination of the other logical
columns.
I tried to use
  apply(df,1,all)
It did not work because of the implicit string conversion.
So I made the functions
  All<-function(...) all(as.logical(...))#because all cannot be used with apply
  Any<-function(...) any(as.logical(...))#because any cannot be used with apply
Now 
  apply(df,1,All)
seemed to work,
but produced some NAs where there was no reason for them.
I debugged apply and found that some logical values are transformed to " TRUE"
instead of "TRUE". I did not follow that up closer. Instead I worked around it
by doing the string conversion myself and then call apply(dfc,1,All)

It's as documented (i.e. no bug) and the five-letter field for TRUE is
consequence of using format(). 

Behaviour has been changed in r-devel though, since you weren't the
first to be annoyed by it....

Meanwhile, I believe that do.call("cbind",df) is a better workaround.

Here's a reproducible example of this:

> x <- c(FALSE, TRUE)
> y <- x
> df <- data.frame(x,y)
> df
      x     y
1 FALSE FALSE
2  TRUE  TRUE
> apply(df, 1, all)
Error in all(..., na.rm = na.rm) : incorrect argument type
> All <- function(...) all(as.logical(...))
> apply(df, 1, All)
    1     2 
FALSE    NA 

The good news is that r-devel (to become 1.9.0) gives the correct
result because of this change:

    o   as.matrix.data.frame() now coerces an all-logical data frame
        to a logical matrix.

The bad news is that r-patched does not.  I guess the workaround while
you're waiting for 1.9 would be to write All as follows:

All<-function(x) all(as.logical(gsub(" ", "", x)))

Thanks for the report.

Wrap your data frame in data.matrix() and you should be fine; e.g.,

  apply(data.matrix(df), 1, all)

Don't think this qualifies as bug...

Subject: [Rd] Graphics device API
Message-ID: <DE8C66B6-5B51-11D8-A1CE-000A959F327E@math.uni-augsburg.de>

I just wrote a graphics device taking the X11 device in R-devel as a 
guide (I was told it's the reference device). It works perfectly with 
R-devel, but I just noticed that the API (e.g. the use of 
R_GE_gcontext) is incompatible with previous versions of R. Is the 
current API in R-devel set in stone or are there any further plans to 
change the API? (If so, how far?) Also, is there any 'recommended' or 
'official' way to provide compatibility (beside using wrappers in 
various #ifdef's..)?

Thanks,
Simon

It's the closest we've currently got to documentation on graphics devices.

I'm still mucking about with it a bit.  The plan is to have something 
officially documented for 2.0.  I view the current status of the API as 
"unofficial";  it's there so that people can make external devices, but 
you should be aware that it will change -- I am trying to keep device 
maintainers up to date with the changes as they happen.  To be honest, I 
would not expect the 2.0 API to be "set in stone" either.  That API will 
be the result of restructuring and cleaning up the graphics code base, 
without trying to add any new features, but there are a number of 
aspects of the API that will require further resdesign.  A good example, 
is the ability to extend the device API with external code (at the 
moment the device API rigidly prescribes the operations that a device 
can perform).

At the moment, a package can specify something like ...

Depends: R (>= 1.9.0)

... in the DESCRIPTION file.  This at least avoids the problem of using 
a "newer" device on an "older" version of R.  It does not solve the 
problem of further incompatible changes happening in 2.0 (i.e., using an 
"older" device on a "newer" R).

I intend to implement some useful suggestions from Thomas Baier to 
improve this situation.  The idea would be to include explicit version 
information as part of the device API so that external devices can check 
both with compiler directives and dynamically in the code for changes in 
the API.

Peter,

To be clear, I presume that you are referring to either the single or
double 't' in the words 'subsettable' and 'subsetable'.

Note also that in R-lang.pdf, the following also exists:

10.4.3 Index constructions
...
The object can formally be any valid expression, but it is understood to
denote or evaluate to a subsetable object. 
...



A Google search suggests that both spellings are in use, though a quick
review would suggest that the double 't' is more common. 

For example:

at http://www4.ncsu.edu/~sgarg/l2h/node7.html, the following:

"Modularization and Subsetable systems"


Then of course, Omegahat has this:

http://www.omegahat.org/api/org/omegahat/Environment/DataStructures/Subsettable.html


Curiously, I have not been able to find either spelling in any
"mainstream" english language dictionary (ie. Oxford, Cambridge,
Websters). 

I could not find 'subsetting' in any dictionary either, though that word
with a double 't' also appears frequently in many technical references,
including ?"[":

"You can write methods to handle subsetting of specific classes of
objects..."


If you want my vote (FWIW), I would go with the double 't'. Keep in mind
that while I now live in Minnesota, I was born in Brooklyn, New York.
That may bias your opinion as to whether or not I am a native English
speaker...  ;-)

I will of course defer to any English majors who may be reading this.

Unfortunately, with English it's conceivable that they're both 
correct.  But the double 't' sounds/looks *more* correct to me.
Of course, this is coming from a native English speaker who is 
generally unfamiliar with the rules of English.

On the other hand:

test --> testable?
arrest --> arrestable?
contest --> contestable?
detest --> detestable?
...

So maybe the single 't' is correct.  Did that clear things up?

This is probably not a valid comparison, since test->testing whereas 
set->setting. 

Oxford (OED) lists the word 'settable' but not 'setable'. subsettable (or 
subsetable) is obviously an artificial word (we use subset as a verb), but 
presumably invented derivatives of 'subset' should behave in a manner similar 
to those of 'set'.

OK...wait a minute.  I just found the following at:

http://grammar.uoregon.edu/spelling1.html

[Go Ducks!]

To Wit:

DOUBLING A FINAL CONSONANT WHEN ADDING A SUFFIX: from "Correct Spelling
Made Easy" (p. 69)


1) The word must end in just one consonant.
        
Compel (l + ed or ing) = Compelled; Compelling

But Not : Resist (+ ed or ing) = Resisted; Resisting
        
        
2) There must be only one vowel before the final single consonant.
        
Refer (r + ed or ing) = Referred; Referring

But Not: Appear = Appeared; Appearing
        

3) The last syllable of the verb must receive the accent.
        
Commit (accent on mit) = Committed; Committing
        
But Not: Profit = Profited; Profiting
        
        
4) The suffix to be added must start with a vowel--in order to double
the final consonant.
        
Defer (r + ed) = Deferred

But Not: Defer + ment) Deferment


So, if these rules are correct, it should be "subsetable", as 'subset'
meets 1, 2 and 4, but fails 3, as the accented syllable according to
various dictionaries is 'sub' and not 'set'.

Is it too late to change my vote?

Thus, 'testing' fails due to rule 1 ('st'), whereas it is 'setting' due
to 'et'.

LOL....

OK....this would make sense then if the aforementioned grammar rules
were applied to the root word of 'set' rather than 'subset'. In other
words, it would be 'settable' as opposed to 'setable', then add the
prefix 'sub'.

If that is the case, then 'set' passes rule '3' regarding the accented
syllable, since of course 'set' has only one syllable.

Well...there ya have it...English...as clear as mud.

I expect this case is more like "upset," and I think there are four 
important rules.

1/ Is it being used as a noun, adjective, or verb?

2/ It may be done differently in England than it is in the colonies, but 
you can't count on it.

3/ No matter which way you do it you are certain to upset someone.

4/ If you do it both ways you may appease everyone, but more likely you 
will upset everyone.

English (OED or Chambers) will be subsettable, American might well have a
single t. I notice this most in words with double l: eg American uses
`modeling' rather than `modelling'.

R usually tries to use English (but is a little schizophrenic about OED vs
Chambers, eg for words ending in -i{s,z}e

Admitting the stress goes upon the second syllable of 'subset' is the simplest explanation I believe - Ocam's razor :-)

In the Windows device, fonts 10 and 11 are fixed width "Courier New".
In general graphics devices don't have to supply such a font.

In particular, I don't think it is possible in the postscript and x11
devices (unless you switch the basic fonts in postscript). It
shouldn't be hard to add, though -- basically just add a Courier font
at font positions 6, and maybe continue with bold and oblique
variants. However, I wouldn't know whether any of what Paul has been
up to involves a more radical solution to font handling in general.

The current R-devel graphics device API supports font family name - I 
just didn't check yet which parameter is used to set it (fontfamily?).

I did:

make
sudo make install
sudo make install-aqua

Everything seems to be OK (some warnings about multiple definitions of
some symbols).  However:

bass$ /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R
Fatal error: unable to open the base package

I got the same message when clicking on R.app in /Applications

This didn't help either:

bass$ env R_HOME=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R
WARNING: ignoring environment value of R_HOME
Fatal error: unable to open the base package

This is with the most recent r-devel (rsync'ed a few minutes ago).

I do have R-1.8.1 installed.

What did I miss in the installation?

Hm. Strange. The only things I can think of is remnants of old
R installs, or not doing a clean install, having some old
environmental variables sitting around, or undesirable
interaction with R-1.8.1.

I think some detective work is in order:

Can you do 

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R RHOME

? 

and does that directory have library/base looking like a base package?
Are permissions etc. alright? 

I'm not a Mac person, but can you do something like "strace" on the
R binary and see what file it is trying to open and what its "dying
words" are?

It seems that the permissions for the base packages are wrong but ok for
the recommended packages.  Fixing the permissions does fix the problem.  
The question left is why the permissions are different?

Thanks for the help!

I've never had these problems and I just built R-devel on three 
different machines these last two days.
My suspect is that you have R in /usr/local/* and during building 
something has gone wrong.
You should try to

sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework

remove any version of R in the path
and try to redo
sudo make-install


please let me know.

Hello all,

I notice that the R package, the manuals and even the FAQ have ISBN
numbers. I help write the Gnumeric (GNOME's spreadsheet) manual and
wondered how you all managed to get those numbers. Also are these
numbers interrelated so that if you gain a document, its number would
follow from your existing numbers.

Any pointers to information would be appreciated.

I have also been having some trouble building R-devel on Panther.
Using,

./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua

produces lots of warnings about multiple definitions of symbols, e.g.

ld: warning multiple definitions of symbol _zlibVersion
/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib(zutil.o) definition of _zlibVersion
../../../bin/libR.dylib(zutil.o) definition of _zlibVersion
ld: warning multiple definitions of symbol _BC
/usr/local/lib/libreadline.4.3.dylib(terminal.so) definition of _BC
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.dylib(lib_termcap.o) definition of _BC

and then dies with:

make[4]: *** [R_aqua.so] Error 1
make[3]: *** [R] Error 2
make[2]: *** [R] Error 1
make[1]: *** [R] Error 1
make: *** [R] Error 1

On the other hand,


./configure --enable-R-shlib --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

seems to make and install fine.  R 1.8.1 built on this machine (a G5) --with-aqua
so I'm a little mystified.  Any suggestions on things to check would be most
welcome.

I have added fontfamily to the "graphics context" information that can 
be passed from the graphics engine to graphics devices.  Two rather 
important things remain to be done:

(i) the devices need to do something with this information.  As Duncan 
Murdoch pointed out, Windows already allows something similar via a 
device-specific approach to the existing font parameter.  I have 
suggested (but not yet tried to implement) a more device-independent 
approach in http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/gpars.html (linked 
off the "R Developer" web page).  I haven't really had feedback on this 
suggestion yet and I intended to elicit more before hacking any code.

(ii) the graphics systems (base and grid) need to allow the user to set 
this information.  grid has a fontfamily gpar, but base has nothing yet. 
  Again a suggested implementation is in 
http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/gpars.html and there is a bit 
more in http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/R/fonts.html

Going back to the original question, for Windows, postscript, and pdf at 
least, if you have a mono-spaced font on your system you should be able 
  to use it, but the way in which you specify it will differ (see the 
docs for each device).  In future versions this should become as simple 
as specifying the appropriate font name as a par() for all devices.

This is no problem. R does not use the Apple provided
zlib, but the dynamic linker looks there first. The second
warning would probably go away if you recompiled
readline in /usr/local (because Apple did not provide
ncurses until Panther). Anyway, there are no conflicts.

This, of course, is a problem. Try a completely clean
install. And then it may be interesting what happens
just before this.

Subject: [Rd] changes to grid
Message-ID: <402E8341.3050107@stat.auckland.ac.nz>

Hi

I am planning some changes to the grid graphics package for the next R 
release.  A couple of these changes impact on code which uses 
grid.edit() or grid.pack()

I believe that I have spoken directly to the main package maintainers 
who would be affected by these changes, but before I plough these 
changes into R I would like to check that there are no other packages 
out there that would be adversely affected.

If you make use of grid (specifically, if you use grid directly; 
lattice code is being dealt with by Deepayan), it would be helpful if 
you could check your code works ok.  You will need to use the current 
development version of R AND install the experimental version of grid 
available at http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html#docs
Any problems should be signalled by your code producing an error message.

Thanks for any help

Paul

I'm quite fond of the new R_GR_gcontext approach. As of fonts, the 
fontdb idea sounds good to me, too. The alternative would be similar to 
what Java does: define generic types like "Serif" as strings and 
interpret anything else as device specific (but fontdb seems cleaner to 
me, because R can compute on the list).

The only thing I'm not quite sure about is the alpha handling. I don't 
know if I got this right, but wouldn't an alpha slot (or slots) collide 
with the RGBA specification? I mean: what is the result of 
col=0x80808080, colalpha=0.5 supposed to be? IMHO adding alpha as 
additional parameter to rgb and friends sounds appealing to  me and 
preferable to additional gc entries. I would argue that col="red" is 
fully opaque red and if you need alpha, you need to specify it in an 
another way (not all devices support alpha anyway...). However 
col="#0000ff80" should be easy to support, too. Additional alpha flag 
in gc would have the benefit of easily obtainable "ghost" plots, but 
the question is whether this would not be better handled by the R side 
and not the device side...

No objections here - it sounds like a sensible proposal to me...

Hello...

   I tried to build R-devel today on Fedora Core 1 (with gcc 3.3.2)
but I am running into a couple of errors.  On the same system R-1.8.1
compiles just fine, as did a previous version of R-devel.

This is what I did:

  # change LANG as default in FC1 is UTF-8
  export LANG=en_US.ISO8859-1
  export LANGVAR=en_US.ISO8859-1

  # get fresh sources and configure
  mkdir R-devel
  rsync -vrC rsync.r-project.org::r-devel R-devel
  cd R-devel
  ./tools/rsync-recommended
  ./configure


This results in the following configuration:

After typing "make" the build process started and everything look ok
until an error message in the directory /library/stats4 occurs
(see full make log file below):

  Error in get(x, envir, mode, inherits) : variable ".getGenerics" was

Later the make process aborts with a string of messages

   Error: couldn't find function ".installPackageNamespaceInfo"


Any idea what could be going on?

Not really, but a build from the current CVS on SuSE9 seems to work
fine...

I just finished building R-devel (rsync'd tonight) on a fully updated
FC1 system with:

gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.3.2 20040108 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.2-6)

It built fine and passed make check-all without problem.

You might want to try to re-download the source, in case you had a
corrupt transfer.

HTH,

ISBN numbers can be purchased from a country-specific agency. The R
Foundation currently owns a series of 100 numbers, i.e. all ISBNs of
form 3-900051-xx-y (y is only a checksum).  We can use those freely
for documents we publish, if the respective document is allowed to get
an ISBN (manuals and software are).

For details see www.isbn.org. Where you get free ISBNs depends on the
country of the *publisher*, in case of the R Foundation that is
Austria.

Please let me know if you need more help.

Best,
Fritz

PS: I really like gnumeric :-)

That's it! In our system we have a system wide setting of the R_LIBS 
variable - which of course points to the stable version of R...

If I switch this variable off, everything works.

Many thanks!

Dear R-bug,

I loved R but there seems some limitation, not the hardware
capacity. It said, 'can't allocate vector...etc.'
entire program attached with error message.

Is this English or American (you know, the language referred to in the USA
as `English')?  The rules (and usages) for doubling do differ between the
two languages: they can even differ by meaning for words with two or more
meanings (and don't ask me for examples as I have forgotten them).

As an English English speaker, my sense and my employer's dictionary both
suggest doubling here.

I don't know that Peter has made a final decision, but I _think_ that
there was a general consensus on the use of the double "t".

I believe that it was Thomas, who earlier in this thread, suggested that
the English (as in 'not American') spelling is generally preferred in R
documentation, though there is a level of schizophrenia (his word)
regarding some things (ie. color vs. colour, etc.).

Best regards,

Marc

Yes, we don't have many in the Development Core Team who did their
pre-university education in the U.S.A., even among (which I initially
spelled as "amoung") those who currently live and work in the U.S.A.
Those born and schooled in Canada (Robert Gentleman, John Chambers,
Duncan Murdoch and me) outnumber those who were schooled in the U.S.A
(only Luke Tierney, I believe).  Others currently working in the
U.S.A. include Thomas Lumley (Australia) and Duncan Temple Lang
(Ireland).  All of us who were schooled on the British spellings and
now are expected to use American spellings in our everyday writing
have a certain level of schizophrenia.

    See Also:

        '[.factor' for subsetting of factors.

        'gl' for construction of "balanced" factors and 'C' for factors
        with specified contrasts. 'levels' and 'nlevels' for accessing the
        levels, and 'codes' to get integer codes.

`codes` is deprecated.  `unclass` also gives the integer codes.  Perhaps
`unclass` is a better choice?

You should read the readme file. This is not a bug.
BTW, you have to install the libreadline package that you find in the 
RAqua.dmg disk image.

Examples:

... [lines deleted]

     ## assign just one name
     z <- 1:3
     names(z)
     # change just the name of the third element.
     names(z)[2] <- "b"
     z

Should the second comment read "... second element."
rather than "... third element."?

Yes. Or else [2] should read [3].

After updating perl from 5.6.1 to 5.8.2, R no longer builds.

Also note that the build continued even after the failure.  Is that a bug or a
feature?

	RCMD SHLIB == Couldn't reserve space for cygwin's heap, Win32 ?
Message-ID: <006301c3f598$1c7b1b90$0a00a8c0@rodan>

I've been trying to create/load/call a dll from R-1.8.1 on Windows without
much success. I've been able to at least load the library on FreeBSD
(1.8.1). I've been able to perform this before using DLL that weren't
created using RCMD SHLIB, but simply compiling under MS DevStudio.

C:\optflikam>

 Then from R, I've tried to simply load the library and R crashes and I
can't load the DLL. I keep getting the following error:

> dyn.load( "optflikam.dll" )
      5 [main] ? 4012 init_cheap: Couldn't reserve space for cygwin's heap,

BaseAddress 0x61670000, RegionSize 0x1050000, State 0x10000

I thought it might have something to do with the compiler, so I looked at
the version of cygwin's gcc:

C:\optflikam>gcc --version

Is this the problem and has anyone else run into this? I've never seen this
meesage before.

I'd worry about this warning:  stdcall is the name of a calling
convention, so this is likely some code being misinterpreted pretty
badly.

><built-in>:61:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition

This also looks like trouble to me...

Your DLL expects to be running under Cygwin.  R doesn't run Cygwin; we
use the MinGW compiler.   DLLs produced by all sorts of other
compilers do work, so you might be able to get Cygwin to work if you
try hard enough -- but it's probably easier to install MinGW.  See
mingw.org for downloads, etc., and the readme.packages file in the
Windows installation for our recommended toolsets.

Could you please resubmit this in a readable form?  The R-bugs system does 
not handle attachments as you will see.

In any case, it is preferable (and courteous) to send reports to the
maintainer of the package, not R-bugs.

Subject: [Rd] src/scripts/Makefile bug (PR#6598)
Message-ID: <20040218124556.A89BBEAE5@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

Hi,

src/scripts/Makefile uses @ as the separator for sed.

This is fine unless the path names happen to contain @, which would
frequently be the case in sites where AFS is used and the AFS magic
path component @sys is used to distinguish between system types.

Please change the separator to #, for example.

Subject: [Rd] return a list of vectors from C?
Message-ID: <03a101c3f646$55855190$0a00a8c0@rodan>

I've been working on a shared library that will be called from R. The
functions pass several vectors in and out (residuals, parameters, etc) and I
would like to be able to return a list of objects. I'm familiar with return
single objects (vectors, etc) from a C function, but need a little help for
returning a list of objects.

My code so far looks something like:

/* this function will perform the same tasks as the previous */
/* and return a list of the values rather than just the  */
/* optimal values. It should return the optimization info as */
/* well as the residual values from the flikam function  */
SEXP testfunc2(
   SEXP *pq,
   SEXP *obs )
{

   int  i;
   double *pq_vect;
   double *obs_vect;

   SEXP  ret_val;

   PROTECT( pq = coerceVector( pq, REALSXP ) );
   PROTECT( obs = coerceVector( obs, REALSXP ) );

   pq_vect = REAL( pq );
   obs_vect = REAL( obs );


   /* call my functions for the results */


   /* generate the output list */
   PROTECT( ret_val = allocVector( VECSXP, NPQ ) );

What package would be a good example of how to do this?

Hello.

I am not sure if this is a bug.

I loaded into R a very large matrix, around 600,000 X 30 integers.  My 
machine has 2G ram.

After trying to write.table a modification of this matrix, R generated 
some sort of malloc error.

Then,

Error: vector memory exhausted (limit reached?)
 > q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n
*** malloc: vm_allocate(size=8421376) failed (error code=3)
*** malloc[14681]: error: Can't allocate region
Error: vector memory exhausted (limit reached?)
 >

Eventually I just killed the R session directly.

I've just committed a new version of the quartz device to R-devel.
This seems to fix the problem with displaying math symbols in plots 
under Panther.

I can't not more test R under Jaguar (at least not these days). In case 
you have the opportunity to do that, please send me a report if it 
brokes everything under Jaguar (or eventually say "it's ok")
A couple of test as example(plotmath) and demo(plotmath) should suffice 
to see if things go smoothly.

Which would then fail for people who for some reason have # in their
file path.  I am not sure there is an easy fix for the problem.  One
idea might be setting up a pipeline which tries different separators.

Any other ideas?

What happened to the results of R.version?  In particular what OS is this?

It looks like your process ran out of VM space, in which case there is 
little it can do but abort (if it can).  It is usually cleaner to kill the 
process from the shell.

I am not sure this is a bug in R, but it is not something we can fix at
all easily without a reproducible example.  And it does not look like
something worth spending a lot of time on.

If this is a standard Unix shutdown (as in Rstd_CleanUp), one possibility 
is that you had a .Last action trying to save: I can see no reason for 
anything else there to be allocating large amounts of memory.  See ?q
for details and how to circumvent this.

Your point is of course valid, but I'm not aware of any systems that
habitually use the number sign as a path component (which should not
be taken as proof that such systems do not exist, of course), whereas
in AFS, the @ sign appears everywhere because of the "magic" @sys
component.

I doubt it would be possible to use the null character as the separator
in sed, but if so, I seem to recall that it cannot appear in file names...

This might be worth a wishlist/bug report (I'll submit it as such if 
nobody disagrees).


The following objects are nonsense in a way (too huge). It may happen, 
that you have got a bug in your code that generates such objects, so it 
would be great to get another error message telling the problem more 
precisely.

Obviously, the following error messages are caused by an integer overflow:

numeric(2^31)
Error in vector("double", length) : negative length vectors are not allowed

matrix( , 2^31, 1)
Error in matrix(, 2^31, 1) : negative extents to matrix

matrix( , 2^31/10, 100)
Error in matrix(, 2^31/10, 100) : negative length vectors are not allowed

Wouldn't the easiest thing be to make the separator be
user-configurable, in config.site (or MkRules, for Windows)?  These @
separators only show up in R.sh.in and Makefile.in in the src/scripts
directory, don't they?

All of these stem from the use of constructions like

    len = asInteger(CADR(args));

and a failure to check the return value for NA.

We'll add suitable checks, so don't bother with a bug report.

Subject: [Rd] Possible error in ?axTicks
Message-ID: <1077205504.26976.240.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

Before posting to r-bugs, I thought that I would just verify this one
first.

It looks like the help for axTicks() needs to be corrected.

It presently says:

'axTicks()' can be regarded as an R implementation  of the C function
'CreateAtVector()' in '..../src/main/graphics.c' which is called by
'axis(side,*)' when no argument 'at' is specified.


However, CreateAtVector() is actually in '..../src/main/plot.c' (line
684) instead. It is referenced in graphics.c.

In r-devel's plot.c, it is at line 691 in plot.c instead and the same
presumed error is in the r-devel version of the help for axTicks().

>From a review of older source tarballs, it appears that CreateAtVector()
appears circa R version 0.62 and was in plot.c at that time. If my read
of the source code is correct, it appears that CreateAtVector() either
supplements and/or replaces GPretty() and GLPretty(), which have been in
graphics.c, but I did not look too hard at that.

Let me know if you want me to post this one.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Mmm... R crashes if you feed it a lot of junk. There must be a
bug in the garbage collector.

We should probably take notice that these integer calculations
effectively limit the size of a vector to 2G-elements (2^31-1 ==
2147483647), i.e. 16GB for numeric() and 8GB for integer(). That's
hardly going to bite many people just now, but within a few years it
might.

Message-ID: <C4178DC99E08604EA5E2BDB989F09380090C78@extas2-hba.tas.csiro.au>

'update.default( x, ...)' checks for a component of 'x' named 'call' and gives up if there isn't one. Before giving up, how about checking for an attribute named 'call'?

I.E. something like this: 
    # Existing code:
    call <- object$call

    # Suggested insertion:
    if (is.null(call))
      call <- attr( object, 'call')

    # Existing code:
    if( is.null( call))
stop("need an object with call component or attribute") # slight mod

Why would anyone store the call as an attribute, you may ask? Well, I often find it useful to write code that returns a data.frame, which would be corrupted by adding a 'call' component-- but I still want to record how the object was generated, so I use a 'call' attribute instead. Of course it would be possible to extend the object's class to inherit from 'data.frame' and write an 'update' method for that class, but that seems like overkill.

It's more fundamental than those calculations: allocVector is defined as

SEXP allocVector(SEXPTYPE type, int length)

and is part of the API.  Quite a lot of the internal length calculations
are in ints, too.  We could change the API now to R_size_t (unsigned long) 
as I don't think it would break anything except already compiled code on 
64-bit platforms. (But code would need to be altered to make good use of 
the change).

There is another problem, silent overflow of calculations like nc * ns, of 
which I found a couple of instances and there may be more.

Subject: [Rd] unexpected postscript output with par(mfg)
Message-ID: <403627FF.70602@jhsph.edu>

Hi, a colleague of mine encountered some unexpected behavior regarding 
the postscript output from R.  It's difficult for me to tell whether 
or not this is an R problem or a ghostview/gv/interpreter problem. 
Just to note, I think it's exactly the same situation reported here:

http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02/archive/25436.html

The following code produces a working plot (no problems, as far as I 
can see):

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot.new()
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
dev.copy2eps(file = "plot1.eps")

However, the following code, which appears on the screen to be 
identical to the above plot, generates an EPS file which ghostview/gv 
displays as blank.

par(mfrow = c(2,2), mfg = c(1,2))
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
dev.copy2eps(file = "plot2.eps")

If I use postcript() directly instead of dev.copy2eps(), plot1 is 
again fine, and plot2 appears fine when viewed in gv.  However, when 
plot2 is included into a LaTeX file (via \includegraphics), it is 
upside-down and backwards and resized.

Has anyone encountered such behavior before?  When I run a diff on 
plot1.eps and plot2.eps (generated by dev.copy2eps) it looks like 
there is an entire chunk of code in plot1.eps that doesn't exist in 
plot2.eps.

The problem was originally identified on Windows but it happens on 
Linux too.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I gave it a shot on a Jag machine (darwin 6.8), here are my results.

Do we have the chicken-and-egg problem again?
during the build, while building R_X11.so:
ld: can't locate framework for: -framework R

I thought this was fixed a while ago: you can't use -framework R when 
building R modules, because R is not installed as a framework yet. I 
had proposed the fake framework for building or different flags for 
initial build and packages build, but I don't remember which solution 
was used in the end - and it seems like none is used in the current 
R-devel :P

The quick-and-dirty way to bypass the above is something like this:
sudo bash
# this will fail, but at least create the proper directories
make install
# we need to copy at least the library
mkdir /Library/Frameworks/Versions/1.9.0/Resources/bin
cp bin/libR.dylib /Library/Frameworks/Versions/1.9.0/Resources/bin
cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions
ln -s 1.9.0 Current
cd ..
ln -s Versions/Current/Resources/bin/libR.dylib R

now you should be able to re-run make
this is just a hack for those who get stuck and want to test the 
R-devel anyway. Fixes for this problem are those discussed before.
(I was away for a week so I didn't test R-devel in the meantime and I 
strongly suspect that this is not Jag-dependent)

Well, define "smoothly" - on the Jag machine I tested the font face is 
constant and all math symbols and operators appear as boxes - i.e. the 
font is not changed, but no errors or crashes.

this should not happen. Now we only change this in the installed 
version of R not in build dir. Do you have another R in the path 
breaking up things?

what we do now is:
* nothing in build dir of R, because of the problem above.
* we changed etc/Makeconf in the R.framework only after R.framework 
installation
could you please try to see what yo have in etc/Makeconf and bin/SHLIB 
inside your build dir? I mean, did you happen to have -framework R 
somewhere? ($LIBR)

ehm and surely you have done the build on a fresh (and cleaned) 
rysinced version of R-devel :)

so, it doesn't work at all. This means that, that patch should not be 
applied on Jaguar and further means that I have to identify which 
version of OSX is running.

I've just committed a change. Under Jaguar the old behavior is 
maintained. Could you give another try?

I've just committed changes to R-devel (to become 1.9.0) to allow
scripts to be invoked using the Unix-style "R CMD command" in Windows.
"Rcmd command" will still work, but is no longer documented.

A build incorporating these changes should show up on CRAN tomorrow.

Running "R" by itself will start Rterm.exe.  You still run Rgui to get
the GUI version (or just click on the shortcut).

Very nice -- my Cygwin-ish scripts will then work at home without changes.

Is it possible to spawn Rgui from R(term)?  For consistency, 
"R --gui=$something", maybe R --gui=windows, would be nice.

My R-code is working great but periodically I have error message for the same

To fix it I need to exit R and reboot my PC (Dell 530 with dual CPU).
What is wrong R 1.8.1(I never had such error messages for the same R code in

I recall that the doc-generating perl scripts can use substantial 
amount of memory (easily 500MB on my box, for example), so how much 
memory do you have? Also 5.8 may have bigger overhead than 5.6 
resulting in the use of more memory ... Provided you have less than 
512MB, adding VM or preferably real memory should help ;)

This doesn't directly affect the functionality of R except for the help 
files that were not built, afaik.

Subject: [Rd] GUI from Terminal.app
Message-ID: <8C6AE987-64BB-11D8-B592-000A95A67E82@stat.ucla.edu>

If you start R from the terminal and then do non-X11 graphics, you
get SetFrontProcess errors. For instance, I have a version of R
configured without x11 and with the Aqua version of tcl/tk. If
I start this, load tcltk, and do tkStartGUI() I cannot bring the window
to the front, because clicking it gives SetFrontProcess errors.

There is, however, a simple way to fix this. Make a copy of R.bin,
call it RGUI, then say

/Developer/Tools/Rez -t APPL Carbon.r -o RGUI

and change the name of the R binary in the R startup script from R.bin
to RGUI. Then this R will give a tkStartGUI window that you
can interact with. The same is true for the tk demos, which
now have nice aqua windows you can interact with.

Also, starting quartz() and interacting with the quartz device works  
fine,
and demos such as tkdensity now display two nicely interacting
aqua windows. Also, you get a working version of Rcmdr in this way.
Thus you have a version of RAqua which does not use the RAqua
GUI but only the terminal. And we have a seemingly reliable way to
use Aqua tcl/tk (and get rid of all of X11). It does not cost anything  
to add the
Rez command above to the Makefile, and the benefits are huge. There
does not seem to be a need to warn if quartz() is started from the
terminal.

Remains the fact that I have been looking for this solution for two  
years
and it turns out to be this simple. Must be pretty well hidden. Observe
the Rez command gives RGUI a resource fork and metafile info, also
observe this would not work with Cocoa.

I was slightly too optimistic. If RGUI is started then .Device
is the null device. If you say quartz() then you cannot
interact with the graphics window (probably related to the quartz
device warning). If you now say library(tcltk) the device
is set to quartz and the window comes alive. If the
first thing you say is library(tcltk), then the device is
automatically set to quartz, and subsequent calls to
quartz() are fine.

[ I don't seem to have the original handy ]

This seems to have broken builds under linux (at least on Fedora).
I get a string of messages of the form

/home/ihaka/R/bin/R CMD: /home/ihaka/R/bin/R CMD: No such file or directory

I am currently working around this by changing lines in
src/scripts/R.sh from

       exec sh "${R_HOME}/bin/R CMD" "${@}" ;;

to

       exec sh "${R_HOME}/bin/Rcmd" "${@}" ;;

between "configure" and "make".

Probably the ideal solution is:

exec sh "${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD "${@}" ;;

Otherwise, sh tries to interpret the first argument as a pathname (i.e. 
looking for "R CMD" in that directory, rather than treating the space as 
an argument separator).

Message-ID: <46192C86-6504-11D8-BB91-000A95A67E82@stat.ucla.edu>

I have made a regular R install, so that  
/Library/Frameworks/R.frameworks/Resources/bin/R.bin
is now a Carbon APPL, using Rez in the way described before. We now  
have basically
two R's -- one from Terminal.app and one from R.app. The first one  
works fine, except
for the small glitch of not starting the default device properly. The  
second one does not
work properly with Aqua Tcl/Tk, while the first one does. Both work  
with the quartz device.
Also the first R works fine from the Carbon Emacs using ESS (while the  
standard build
cannot use the quartz device from Emacs).

This means that people who (a)  prefer to run their R from the Terminal  
or from Emacs,
and (b) who prefer Aqua to X11, should use the first R. Since I am one  
of these people,
the next release of R on gifi will have no X11 and no R.app.

There was no problem with version 1.68, and I believe this was an error
(as otherwise the call would be infinitely recursive, R CMD calling R 
CMD).

I have reverted the change (in R.sh.in) to 1.68.

There's not enough memory available for R to perform the requested
operations.
See ?Memory and the "R for Windows FAQ" how to overcome the problem.

Please note that it is *not* a bug in R that it needs some memory to
perform calculations ...

That's the aim, but it's probably not quite true yet.  There are still
a few differences (see the Invoking R appendix of the R-intro manual
for the ones I know about).  You may also need to define an alias for
R.exe:  Brian Ripley has told me that the tcsh shell he uses maps
executable filenames to lowercase.

That's not currently possible, but it would be an easy change.  I
wouldn't use the name "windows" for the gui:  I'd want a name that
distinguishes it from other GUIs on the Windows platform (though there
are currently none shipping with R).  

Thinking about this, I thought of using "Rgui" as the name, but that
means you'd type

R --gui=Rgui

instead of 

Rgui

and it just didn't seem worth the effort.  g

Sorry about that error, and thanks for the fix.  That file isn't used
in Windows, and I shouldn't have touched it.

I think I found something better (essentially, using slashes as usual,
but quoting them in the replacement string).  Can you pls try a current
version of r-devel?

Full_Name: Federico Gherardini

OS: Gentoo linux
Submission from: (NULL) (81.208.36.89)


When I use fix() to edit a matrix R immediately quits with a segmentation fault
if I use the copy button in the graphical device window. Clicking on the name of
the variables completely  messes up the screen too. In this case you have to
close the grahpic device and call fix() again.
I've compiled R from sources on a pentium4 with these falgs:
CFLAGS="-march=pentium4 -O2 -pipe -msse -msse2 -mmmx"
CXXFLAGS=CFLAGS
and on a Celeron (Mendocino) with these:
CFLAGS="-march=i686 -O2 -pipe -mmmx"
CXXFLAGS=CFLAGS
and I've also tried to use both nano and vim as editors. In each case I always
get the same error on both computers

Subject: [Rd] unexpected postscript output with par(mfg)
Message-ID: <403A27F5.7020209@jhsph.edu>

[I posted this earlier but am not sure if it ever made it to the list. 
  It appears to be in the archives, but I never received a copy sent 
back to me.]

Hi, a colleague of mine encountered some unexpected behavior regarding
the postscript output from R.  It's difficult for me to tell whether
or not this is an R problem or a ghostview/gv/interpreter problem.
Just to note, I think it's exactly the same situation reported here:

http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02/archive/25436.html

The following code produces a working plot (no problems, as far as I
can see):

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot.new()
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
dev.copy2eps(file = "plot1.eps")

However, the following code, which appears on the screen to be
identical to the above plot, generates an EPS file which ghostview/gv
displays as blank.

par(mfrow = c(2,2), mfg = c(1,2))
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
plot(1:10, 1:10, xlab = "", ylab = "")
dev.copy2eps(file = "plot2.eps")

If I use postcript() directly instead of dev.copy2eps(), plot1 is
again fine, and plot2 appears fine when viewed in gv.  However, when
plot2 is included into a LaTeX file (via \includegraphics), it is
upside-down and backwards and resized.

Has anyone encountered such behavior before?  When I run a diff on
plot1.eps and plot2.eps (generated by dev.copy2eps) it looks like
there is an entire chunk of code in plot1.eps that doesn't exist in
plot2.eps.

The problem was originally identified on Windows but it happens on
Linux too.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

The SearchEngine, accessible through generated documentation by help.start()
like:

file:/tmp/Rtmp2085/.R/doc/html/search/SearchEngine.html

or on WWW:

http://www.stat.ucl.ac.be/ISdidactique/Rhelp/doc/html/search/SearchEngine.html

works only in Netscape 4.7x. It fails e.g. with Mozilla 1.3, 1.6 and IE 6.0.

I solved the problem by installing Netscape 4.76 and invoking help by 

    > help.start(browser="netscape4")

where netscape4 is the executable of Netscape 4.76, included in $PATH.

I am sorry, but this is just not true.  Please search the R-help archives
for lots of comments about people having problems and others reporting
success with e.g. Mozilla 1.3 and 1.6.  The problems are not to do with R
but to do with the Java or JavaScript installation or settings.  (I am
currently only able to get this to work with the latest-but-one version of
Sun's JVM on RH8.0/9/FC1.)

I am puzzled by your reference to IE 6.0: does that run under RH9 (there is
no 9.0, as far as we know), and if so where did you get it from?  The
search engine runs in IE 6.0 under Windows if a JVM is installed.

There is no `built-in Java engine' in Mozilla/Netscape (>=6).  You have to
install it and configure it correctly and there are lots of Linux distros
with this not done correctly, as well as version incompatibilities.

So the likely story is that some Linux machines don't have Java installed
or configured.

Thank you, Marc, for finding this, and doing all the detective

I've corrected the lapsus (which is my fault, as author of axTicks()).

Martin,

Thanks for your follow up on this and the confirmation.

Most of all, thanks for axTicks()!  

Besides  being of substantial help day-to-day, it helped me solve a
major problem in barplot2() in the gregmisc package as part of
supporting log scaling on the axes.

Without axTicks(), I had to contrive some workarounds in the early
versions of barplot2() to generate some decent looking default axis
annotation. axTicks made the axis behavior in this situation more
consistent with other functions.

Best regards,

Marc

Confirmed on r-devel/Opteron and 1.8.0/K6, so it has likely been with
us for a while. Goes to show how much people actually use that
interface...

(You didn't quite give reproducibility instructions, but 

data(women); fix(women)

and then press Copy etc. will do it.)

BTW, the messed-up screen can be worked around by minimizing and
unminimizing the window.

This is already corrected in the current R-devel sources.

Note that this is an incorrect use of as.POSIXct: do read the 
description of the allowed formats:

     They can also
     convert character strings of the formats '"2001-02-03"' and
     '"2001/02/03"' optionally followed by white space and a time in
     the format '"14:52"' or '"14:52:03"'.  (Formats such as
     '"01/02/03"' are ambiguous but can be converted via a format
     specification by 'strptime'.)

and you are not getting the result I think you expected.

Finally, the result is not of class "POSIXct", which looks like an 
infelicity in ifelse.

aa <- as.POSIXct(c('1980/1/1','1980/1/2',''))
aaa <- aa
aaa[is.na(aa)] <-  as.POSIXct('1980/1/3') 

is probably what you wanted here.

Subject: [Rd] Script editor for Windows GUI
Message-ID: <403C9EB0.6030601@imperial.ac.uk>

Dear R users / devs,

There's been requests in the past for a text editor built into the Rgui 
for Windows, from which code can be submitted to the R console.  
Something along the lines of the script editor in S-Plus.  Currently 
Rgui can only display a file read-only in a pager.  As far as I can tell 
there's been little motivation to implement an editor, as most 
developers use (the excellent) ESS, or don't use Windows.  I also use 
ESS, but the students here are taught S-Plus and learn to use the .ssc 
editor.   I think it would be a good selling point if the equivalent 
existed for R, without the need to use an external editor (or a hack in 
Tcl/Tk).

So I'd like to write one and contribute it.  I've had a quick mess with 
the code, and I've now got a partially usable editor working.   Before I 
go any further and implement it fully,  I just wanted to ask whether 
this is a desirable thing for R.  In case there are long-term plans to 
scrap and rewrite the whole Rgui code base...   Any gotchas, dos or 
don'ts for writing this?   I suppose we'd want something like a new R 
function file.edit to open the file for editing, analogously to 
file.show which opens a text file read-only.  Currently edit() can be 
used to invoke an editor, but that seems to be designed to work on 
objects rather than files.

Chris

The "graphapp" user interface library that Rgui currently uses is
likely to disappear as soon as someone has the energy to replace it --
but this might not be soon.  If you can write your editor in a way
that it could avoid graphapp, or narrowly compartmentalize your calls
to it (so that they could be replaced by calls to a different library
relatively painlessly), that would be a very good thing.

The other thing that may change sometime in the future is the whole
event loop structure, but there will have to be an event loop of some
sort, so we can hope that shouldn't affect you too much.

I'll be happy to help you with any questions that come up.

Why is that a "hack"? I really must object. 

Tcl/Tk is a GUI framework with a text editing widget which can be
trivially used for this kind of purpose (the same is likely true for
other GUI frameworks like GTk).

or  par(col = "white"),
as Marc has suggested.

legend()'s source code makes it very straightforward to add an
argument 'text.col' for this purpose, and I have already done so
in my development version.
The question is really if the default should be
   text.col = par("col")
or text.col = par("fg")

I'd currently tend for  par("col") , but the tendency is weak.

I agree, I would expect the lines around the legend's box in par("fg"), 
but the font in par("col"). And indeed, that's already the case if both 
values have been set in par().

Sorry, wrong choice of word - no disrespect meant to the work you've 
done with R-Tcl/Tk.  I think I meant more "grafted-on".   Rgui itself is 
not written in Tcl/Tk - so to require installing a whole new GUI 
framework for such a fundamental task as editing R code seems a somewhat 
over-the-top solution.  Rather the strength of  Tcl/Tk seems more for 
building your own customised GUIs.    R for Gnome, on the other hand, is 
written in gtk, but I've never used this so I don't know about its 
editing capability.

you would be right iff ....

- AFAIK you can't easily have a newer version of R for windows
  without tcltk -- hence it's there anyway
- the Bioconductor project (and others as well, notably John
  Fox' R Cmdr) have extended on the basic tcltk functionality
  for many GUI tasks. 
  
tcltk (or Gtk !) have the big advantage of working cross-platform.
This is a very important point since it eases maintainability,
documentation, teaching, .... and development considerably.

That hasn't been decided.  wxWidgets (formerly known as wxWindows) has
been one suggestion.

Martin,

Thanks for taking this on. 

I'll throw in my vote and support the text.col = par("col") approach.

Not so: the mini installation has no Tcl/Tk support.

But it does not work naturally for Windows users.  It does make sense to 
me to use a Windows editor widget for script windows under Windows, which 
is where people seem to want them.  There are also event-loop issues which 
mean I would have little confidence that a Tcl/Tk-based editor would work 
smoothly under Windows.

It has none, not even a version of the data editor.


Let's not discourage Chris from doing this: it would satisfy a lot of 
Windows users, I believe.

summary() should take keywords for the statistics desired.

summary(dataset, method="mean,median");

or something like it.  I would also add an option to have column related
outputs,

var n NA mean sdv min q1 med q3 max
x1  ...
x2  ...
x3  ...

I know one can write this, but it would be nice to have this standard.  summary
is such a basic function that it should be all set in every version of R.

It may be of interest that our group is working on a GUI for R written 
in Java, i.e. it should be platform independent (at least we plan to 
support Windows, Mac and Linux). Among many other features this GUI 
includes such an script editor as described above. Data set editor 
mentioned in other posts in this thread is included, too. We are of 
course open for any further ideas or wishes. The official release is 
planned for the useR! 2004 conference in Vienna.

Simon,

That's very interesting, but as you know Java installation can be quite 
problematic.  (It looks like the current Sun JVM 1.4.2_03 has several

mozilla.org about its Windows plugin.)

We bundled a version of Tcl/Tk with the R Windows binary to try to avoid 
compatibility issues, and even then I would prefer a native Windows 
solution for this one.

Would it be enough for 'help.search("delete row")' to go to the
help('[') page?  That could be very easily done.  That man page could
include a reference to the appropriate sections of the R-intro manual
for a more tutorial approach.

The problem with adding functions is that they would be limited in
their range of application, and it would be hard for beginners to
discover them anyway.

For example, the obvious definition of delete.column would be 

 delete.column <- function(x, col) x[,-col]

which would work for data.frames and matrices, but not for vectors, or
for arrays of higher dimensions.

I think enhancing the data editor to allow it to insert and delete
rows and columns would be a better approach than defining a whole list
of functions.  It can already rename and append rows and columns.

I'm aware of the problems caused by various JVM versions. Although our 
Java code is not directly affected, we plan to supply an optional 
installer (for Windows) which will take care of the JVM and install an 
appropriate private JRE if necessary.

I'm definitely not against a native editor. I don't want to discourage 
Chris, especially if he has already a working prototype. To the 
contrary - one implicit point of my post was that we should stay in 
contact, since we have implemented an editor as well and thought about 
the interface and the features, so we could exchange our experiences.

I also wanted to say that we may want to talk about bigger scope here. 
My concern is that the number of scattered GUIs for various platforms 
is increasing and each GUI has own interfaces, inconsistent with 
others, making it hard to switch between GUIs. If one wants to add 
functionality to the 'preferred' GUI then others don't have any benefit 
from the extension. A platform-independent GUI would solve this 
problem, since an improvement would affect all platforms. Furthermore 
using Java, it is possible to offer the quite powerful Java widget set 
to R users, seamlessly integrated into the GUI, thus allowing users to 
extend the GUI as they please - using R. (Besides, users could even 
integrate their own Java code with R, but that's another story...). By 
now we also have an own, working Java graphics device allowing us to 
achieve really tight integration of all aspects of R. I don't claim 
that this should replace the Windows GUI, but I think it might be an 
interesting, flexible alternative. I know that the project is all but 
easy, nevertheless I believe that we got quite far by now.

I am not sure whether or not this is feasible or even
desirable but one thought, given the apparent substantial
effort you have already undertaken, would be whether you
move in the other direction, namely move the entire R core 
to Java (possibly using an automated converter if such 
exist) opening up R to new platforms not currently supported.

R-Folks -

I have a little, old computer (486 processor, 40M RAM, 500M HD).
Is there a little, old version of R that will run on such a machine?
It currently has Windows 3.1, but I could install a little, old
Linux, if necessary.

Thanks!

Chris,

I don't know what you already did or not, but there is an excellent starting
basis for an editor, and it is independent from graphapp, very powerful, and
very easy to use (and stable!), it is called CodeMax
(http://www.winmain.com). There is both a dll and a COM version (I believe
the dll version is best here). Of course, this is in case a Windows-specific
version is desired for RGui.

I use it intensively for SciViews, and also everywhere I need a code/text
editor in my application.
Best,

Philippe Grosjean

I've been using the graphapp stuff that's already there, which is out of 
date, and not very tidy or flexible, but it does this (simple) job.  

CodeMax sounds nice for code editing, but wouldn't there be a problem 
with using proprietary tools to develop R?  I see they allow you to 
freely redistribute the DLL with an application you develop using it.  
But anyone who wanted to hack on the resulting application would need to 
buy a licence, so I wouldn't see R developers accepting this.

I just have one question.  From my very little (and negative) experience
with the Java GUI for S-PLUS on *nix, one big problem is that it doesn't
work when running S-PLUS remotely, either via X or VNC (unless the display
is 8-bit):  The GUI is running, but on screen I just see one big black
rectangle.  Would this be a problem for R as well?  My impression was that
that is totally the problem with Java.  (BTW, I believe S-PLUS also installs
and uses its private JRE.)

Best,
Andy

I do not see that as a problem; I've had reasonable luck running SJava
visualization code from Orca and ROrca remotely (over 1000bT), and VNC
works as well for that, but you are right, have to pay attention to
screen color depth.

Now whether SJava can be used for a stable system is a completely
separate matter; I have had awful luck with it (i.e. semi-stable
rather than rock-solid), which is why we've moved to C++/OpenGL
instead of extending Orca (and hence Java/Java3d) for our
visualization/virtual reality systems.

Hopefully Simon has or will solve that problem; I have confidence
:-). 

best,
-tony

A personal vote would be to make use of the Eclipse IDE, an IDE originally
written for Java but also now being used for other languages, including C#,
COBOL, and ( unless I am mistaken ) the MacroMedia "MX" product suite.
Although the Eclipse IDE suffers from many of the usual problems in Java, it
is a reasonable compromise.  Over time, as a part of Eclipse,  one is apt to
build in the use of an intemediate layer based upon the use of an abstract
syntax tree or stack machine to which "R" is compiled.  Depending upon one
preference, that layer is apt to be the Java JVM, the new Parrot virtual
machine used in PERL 6, a .NET-type of approach, or ( perhaps best )
whatever Luke Tierney decides on.  So you think of the script editor and IDE
as also linked into the long term evolution of "R" as a language.

Subject: [Rd] Script editor for Windows GUI

Dear R users / devs,

There's been requests in the past for a text editor built into the Rgui for
Windows, from which code can be submitted to the R console.  
Something along the lines of the script editor in S-Plus.  Currently Rgui
can only display a file read-only in a pager.  As far as I can tell there's
been little motivation to implement an editor, as most developers use (the
excellent) ESS, or don't use Windows.  I also use ESS, but the students here
are taught S-Plus and learn to use the .ssc 
editor.   I think it would be a good selling point if the equivalent 
existed for R, without the need to use an external editor (or a hack in
Tcl/Tk).

So I'd like to write one and contribute it.  I've had a quick mess with 
the code, and I've now got a partially usable editor working.   Before I 
go any further and implement it fully,  I just wanted to ask whether this is
a desirable thing for R.  In case there are long-term plans to 
scrap and rewrite the whole Rgui code base...   Any gotchas, dos or 
don'ts for writing this?   I suppose we'd want something like a new R 
function file.edit to open the file for editing, analogously to file.show
which opens a text file read-only.  Currently edit() can be used to invoke
an editor, but that seems to be designed to work on objects rather than
files.

Chris

It seems to depend on the *nix and the JVM, under S-PLUS (and SJava and
...).  Solaris, surprisingly, seems one of the worse Unix hosts for this.

John Chambers once told me that he and Duncan TL had very similar SGI 
systems at Bell Labs and Java display on one was much faster than the 
other.

I hope what Simon is doing does solve it, but I am not confident that even 
he can move the world appreciably.

I like many of the features of eclipse -- we've got all of the nice
ones on my ESS roadmap (i.e. via ECB and the Eric Eide emacs tools
integration).  It's a bit harder than it looks, though (many of the
same problems with that (eclipse) would be similar to the problems
that are holding up ESS development, i.e. parsing (for us, using the
emacs semantic bovinator), and language integration.

Of course, one of the problems is that comparably speaking, Eclipse is
much heavier/slower than the Emacs equivalent (JDEE integrated with
ECB).  Somehow, large software systems seem to increase complexity
relative to the hardware tracking Moore's law, breaking even
speed-wise. 

best,
-tony

There is little consistency to the interpretation of these parameters 
across different functions, but my preference would be to use "col"

Thank you Paul (and Marc and Uwe).

      legend(...., text.col = par("col"))

Subject: [Rd] ATLAS threaded 64 bit (Opteron) - need *.so?
Message-ID: <16445.47460.107721.166477@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Using ATLAS with R is an old topic quite covered in the "R
Administration" manual (and by R's "configure" script
collection).

I still do not easily manage to build R properly on our new AMD
Opteron (2-processor).
I did work with the current Atlas 3.6.0, configured manually
(but "express" version) to build a threaded ATLAS version, and
successfully ran Atlas' own   "make ptsanity_test arch=Linux_HAMMER64SSE2_2"  
sanity check as well.

As it is known, this builds only static (*.a) versions of the
ATLAS libraries.  However, after an R site search for (something
like) "ATLAS shared", I found Peter Dalgaard's message
        http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02/archive/7158.html
where PD confirmed it would work fine to link against the static
ATLAS libraries.
I didn't need (his suggestion of) using an explicit "-L..atlas_place...", 
since these libraries are symbolically linked into
/usr/local/lib/ which is searched by default.

Now, R's configure (R-devel of 2004-02-24) 
finds the ATLAS setup well behaved, reporting

>>   R is now configured for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^

and compilation (of course) goes fine till the crucial linking
stage :

gcc -shared   -o libRlapack.so dlapack0.lo dlapack1.lo dlapack2.lo dlapack3.lo cmplx.lo  -lf77blas -latlas -L/usr/lib64 -L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/x86_64-redhat-linux/3.2.3 -L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/x86_64-redhat-linux/3.2.3/../../../../lib64 -L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/x86_64-redhat-linux/3.2.3/../../.. -L/lib/../lib64 -L/usr/lib/../lib64 -lfrtbegin -lg2c -lm -lgcc_s
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libf77blas.a(xerbla.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/local/lib/libf77blas.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

and I'm stuck to some extent.
Note that the "recompile with -fPIC"  must related to the
contents of ATLAS' libf77blas.a itself (or to "xerbla.o" more
concretely), since all of R's  dlapack[0-3].lo are of course
compile with -fPIC.

I tend to conclude that I do need shared versions of ATLAS'
libraries?  If yes, I think I've seen instructions on how to
build these.  Where?
If these are really needed, I think I should add them to the
corresponding "R administration manual" section, right?

Thanks in advance for your share of experience here.

Uwe's code above

   mapply(function(x, y) assign(y, x, envir=env), df, names(df))

would suggest a simplistic  R level implementation of as.environment.list().
But then, as.environment() is primitive,
and as John Chambers is the author of as.environment() and as he has
been travelling recently, I'm addressing this explicitely for further

I don't think we actually got them written down (thank you for
volunteering...) but it isn't terribly hard. There are just two basic
tricks:

- add -fPIC all over the place during configure.

- after building you'll get a bunch of .a files. These can be
  converted to .so using 

        ld -shared -o libfoo.so --whole-archive libfoo.a

One thing I haven't gotten around to yet is the ATLAS/LAPACK
integration mentioned on
http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#completelp

Simon,

This is very interesting and very much in keeping with the direct I woudl
like to take with my own work. We have several Java components that have a
realtime event-driven data stream and would very much like to integrate
these with R using something like the callback mechanism in SJava and then
build GUI components on top of them. We were considering using tck/tk
widgets for the GUI but it would be much better to use Java.

Is you project based upon the SJava package, because we have had lots of
problems with the callback interface?

Would you consider releasing your work in progress under the GPL? We are
keen to avoid re-inventing things and its a long time until we are all at
UseR! - we could at the very least give some user feedback.

On a slightly different tack, I have recently taken a look at Jython - an
implementation of Python in Java that produces byte code that runs on the
JVM. Combined with this there is a project called xoltar which aims to bring
functional programming to Python. This got me thinking that a R parser could
be written in Java for a core set of functionality allowing code and
packages written in "pure-R" to be compiled as byte code and run on the JVM.
Then one could call  the SJava package from Java to execute anything unusual
in R proper.... any thoughts?

PS in terms of a script editor for R ... take a look at the JEdit project
which already supports R and S+ syntax highlighting. There is a plugin
called Sidekick which provides a framework for high-level language-specific
features, such as a structure tree, and code completion... it's all written
in Java so it could be extended to work with R.

Regards,

John

Oooops! They change the license!!! Indeed, I use a derivation of CodeMax v.
2, which is called CodeSense (http://www.ticz.com/homes/users/nlewis/). The
license of both CodeMax v. 2 and CodeSense state "royalty-free license both
for development and applications" (with CodeSense, it is also explicitly
stated that the code source of the control can be used, modified and
redistributed royalty-free). Here is an extract of the license of CodeSense
2.22 which derives from CodeMax 2:

[...]
CodeMax License Agreement
This is a legal agreement between you, the end user, and WinMain Software.
By using this software, you are agreeing to accept ownership of this product
and to be bound by the terms of this agreement. WinMain Software License for
CodeMax:

Grant of License. WinMain Software grants a limited, non-exclusive license
to use unlimited copies of the custom control called CodeMax for the purpose
of developing applications for the Windows environment.

Runtime Distribution License. WinMain Software grants you a royalty-free
right to distribute copies of the runtime dynamic link libraries for use
with applications you have developed using CodeMax.
[...]

I wonder what happens there. I suppose CodeSense, which still keeps this
royalty-free license would be the way to go... but a discussion with its
developer with certainly be worthwhile. What I know be experience: CodeMax
or CodeSense saves your days, if not weeks of development because it is
neat, efficient and feature-rich.
Best,

Philippe

You do need to add -fPIC to the compile flags.  The same thing happens on 
Solaris 64-bit (under some compilers, anyway).  You don't need a shared 
library, but you do need relocatable code in the static libraries.

You can also try building without xerbla.

I think this is a route that many of us are about to take.  However, I 
would avoid ATLAS and use K. Goto's Opteron BLAS, which is easier to get 
to work (no xerbla) and has instructions in R-devel's R-admin.texi file.

Peter D has a dual Opteron and asked about it a while back, probably on
R-core.  (I have played a bit, but our Opteron cluster is a week or so
away now.)

Have you tried configuring R with Goto's BLAS
                http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kgoto/

I haven't worked with Opteron or Athlon64 computers but I understand
that Goto's BLAS are very effective on those machines.  Furthermore
Goto's BLAS are (only) available as .so libraries so you don't need to
mess with creating the .so version.

I tried it, yes. Somewhat to my surprise, it seemed to be not quite as
fast as the threaded ATLAS, but I wasn't very systematic about the
benchmarking.

(and the Goto items have license issues, which get in the way for
binary distributions.)

They have indicated that future releases may have a LGPL licence.

No, we are not using SJava for obvious reasons. I tried hard to fix it, 
but for some platforms that is impossible w/o complete rewrite, so we 
use our own interface now. The Java GUI approach has the advantage that 
it also circumvents the event loop problems in that context.

I think this is a good idea, especially given the feedback I got since 
the post :P. I'll talk to others in the developer team and maybe we 
could leak a developer preview pre-pre-pre-alpha release in the next 
weeks for those interested.

Good question - due to the amount of packages that use C/Fortran code I 
had the impression that this sounds just too crazy. But I'm really keen 
on getting some feedback on this, because technically, one of the CS 
students here would enjoy doing something like that ...

Does anyone here use JEdit? I had a really quick look at it and it 
looks like a copy of Emacs ... which is a pity, because one could do 
much better with Java ;).
Re auto-completion: auto-completing keywords is ok, but how would one 
include all the functions from all the packages? Especially since this 
is runtime-dependent, because in the editor you don't even know which 
packages are loaded at run-time ...

Simon,

right, building a list of (exported) functions from attached packages 
takes some time (not that dramatic, though).

Just an idea: You can maintain a second list containing information 
whether the first list is up to date by just checking which packages are 
attached, so you won't need to update the first list on each 
"auto-completion event".

I don't think so, though you can guess:  integers are stored in 4
bytes, floats in 8, etc.

One way to solve this problem would be to create a connection that did
nothing except keep track of a file position, then do the save to that
connection.  However, it's not easy to define new connection types.
Might be a nice package to write to allow such a thing.

You could try 

 object.size(obj)

which gives the size of the internal representation.  The external
representation should not be much larger.  If you use compress = TRUE
in the save call then the external representation may well be
considerably smaller than the internal.

Message-ID: <8CBAA121CEB4D5118CB200508BB2BBEF05BF7465@xmx8lonib.lonib.commerzbank.com>

I maintain the Irregular Time Series (its) package on CRAN.  I am currently
testing a release.  Under 1.8.1 I am able to define a S4 generic 'start' as
follows:

if(!isGeneric("start")) {setGeneric("start", useAsDefault=start)}

Under 1.9.0, Rcmd check generates an error, as 'start' is not recognised.
If I use the NAMESPACE directive IMPORT, all is well:

import(stats)

(I recall some past postings about refactoring 'base', and I assume that
'stats' is a part of this)

However, the additional directive leads to problems under 1.8.1, as one
might expect, since 'stats' does not exist under 1.8.1.  How to define my S4
generic and make it transparent so that the base function start() is
unaffected, in such a way that it will function under 1.8.1 and 1.9.0?

Thanks

  I think this would be good if we only needed a rough
estimate, but we need something precise.

  That seems reasonable to me.  I'll look into it; are
there any resources at all for how to define new
connection types?

I don't think it is worth it.  Just use an anonymous file connection and 
seek to the end to measure the length.  (Similar to Luke's use of a pipe, 
but more portable.)

I didn't mean to write a package to count bytes, I meant to write a
package that allowed for user-defined connections.  The various
functions (read, write, seek, etc.) needed by the connection would be
supplied by the user in R code.

Then you'd do something like this for the special case of counting
bytes:

count <- 0

countbytes <- function(num, bytes) {
   count <<- count + num
}

f <- userconnection(write=countbytes)

save(list=ls(all=TRUE),file=f)

cat('Byte count is ',count)

Other possible connections you might want:

Circular connections that cycle through a buffer of bytes again and
again.

Encrypting connections which do something to the bytes on their way to
another connection.

Compressing connections which compress or uncompress another
connection.

Bit-level connections that let you read or write one bit at a time.

Concatenating connections that join two inputs to make them look like
a single stream.

Limiting connections that only show the caller a subset of the stream,
within a certain byte range.

Connections that calculate a checksum or CRC on the bytes as they pass
through.

Many years ago I wrote a Turbo Pascal unit containing all of these
things for "streams", the TP equivalent of connections, and it ended
up being surprisingly useful.

I suggest you don't try: there are already quite a few 1.9.0-specific 
versions of packages on CRAN, and 1.8.x will be history in a couple of 
months.

Why do you need to do that?  You could just define an S4 method which will 
automatically make a generic if needed.

Subject: [Rd] Regular expressions & large strings (PR#6617)
Message-ID: <20040227111915.018731042E@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

A possible regex bug when working with large strings.  The
following code snippet

  t5 <- paste( c( "# === TEST", rep(' ', 2452294) ), collapse='')
  str( sub("^.*TEST", "xyz", t5) )
  str( sub("^.*TEST", "xyz", substr(t5,0,200)) )

doesn't behave right; on one machine, the second and third
lines print different results [the second line, on the long
string, doesn't do the substitution], while on another, the
second line causes a segfault.  Both are running R 1.8.1
with PCRE, under NetBSD (1.6.1 and 1.6 respectively).

Possible related (although perhaps not a bug):

  function(n) {
    line <- paste(as.character(trunc(runif(n)*100)),collapse=" ")
    system.time( rep  <- gsub("[[:space:]]", "-", line) )
  }

gives rather long times rising v sharply for big strings (eg
2.2s at n=2e4, 360s at n=2e5 on AMD 1.2GHz).  Other languages 
aren't so slow on this task (eg n=2e5: 0.4s ruby 1.8.1, and
5.2s python 2).  Doubtless my extremely-quick-hack benchmarks
aren't fair, but the difference still seems rather big.

[Moved to R-devel, as that is where `wishlist' items fit best.]

It is not currently possible.  Furthermore, the R base code is riddled
with uses of partial argument matching (check out the uses of rep(), for
example) and partial list matching, although from time to time I try to 
eradicate a bunch of them.

I don't see why in programatic uses of R you cannot always guarantee exact
matching (which will always win), if necessary by having ... as the first
formal argument to your function.  Can you give us an example of the need
to disable partial matching?

Subject: [Rd] Packages in R & Java
Message-ID: <8CBAA121CEB4D5118CB200508BB2BBEF0317EC84@xmx8lonib.lonib.commerzbank.com>

Yes, lots of packages do use C/Fortran code ... it would be great if there
were more packages that are "pure R" especially since the advent of S4
classes and namespaces.

Is it worth suggesting that we create a designation "pure R" for packages
that have no external source code and encourage more of these? Indeed, now
the number of packages is so big could they be classified to aid potential
users?

Going back to the original question, it strikes me that C/Fortran code is
most often used to interface to other code - there would be a better way of
doing this in a Java environment - or to speed up existing R code - where
loops are usually the cause of the speed problem and the introduction Java
bytecode would presumably be helpful anyway. Surely there could be some sort
of process to generate automated jni bindings?

I don't think a Java implementation of the R parser is as bigger task as it
seems ... much of the work to get an interpreted scripting language working
could be taken from the Jython project?

Regards,

John

I'm not sure I understand the advice here. I have also hit the same problem,
and it seems reasonable to me to aspire to maintain a single package which
works on both 1.8.x and 1.9.x.

I think that explicit Genericisation (?) has virtues from the point of view

Even with those, quite often we have to move code to C/C++/Fortran for
efficiency.

Not sure that would be good (encouragement).  It would compromise
solid design principles for aesthetics.

Argh.  JNI is not a saviour.  It's a royal PITA.

And C/Fortran code is probably just as often used to speed up computations.

See the Omegahat LANGUAGE for a solid start on this.  R-like syntax,
and lots more.  Does anyone still use it?

Thanks a lot, Peter, Brian, Doug, for your feedbacks!
In the mean time, I have three running versions of R(-devel) on
the 64-Opteron
- "plain"
- linked against threaded GOTO
- linked against threaded (static) ATLAS  (using -fPIC for compilation;
					   "large" Rlapack)
and I find that GOTO is faster than ATLAS
consistently (between ~ 5-20%) for several tests
(square matrices; %*% and solve).
ATLAS is still an order of magnitude faster than "plain" for
3000x3000 matrices.

Here are somewhat repeatable "ATLAS for R" build instructions:

 1. get ATLAS source; unpack
 2. make : use defaults and "express" installation
 3. Before "make install ...", edit the  Make.<ARCHITECTURE> file:
    add "-fPIC" to three places, namely  F77FLAGS, CCFLAG0, and MMFLAGS:
    which in case of the "threaded Opteron" architecture, leads to
    the three new lines
       F77FLAGS = -fPIC -fomit-frame-pointer -O -m64

	CCFLAG0 = -fPIC -fomit-frame-pointer -O -mfpmath=387 -m64

	MMFLAGS = -fPIC -fomit-frame-pointer -O -mfpmath=387 -m64
    in the file   Make.Linux_HAMMER64SSE2_2

 4. make install arch=Linux_HAMMER64SSE2_2

 5. Sym.link the ATLAS libraries into /usr/local/lib:

    cd /usr/local/lib
    ln -s <ATLAS_build_dir>/lib/Linux_HAMMER64SSE2_2/lib* .

 6. (needed for runtime!):
    Use environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib


Note that I haven't built *.so (shared) libraries yet.

It is not easily possible if namespaces are involved.  We failed to 
anticpate that we would need version-dependent namespaces until rather 
late and then decided not to set up an elaborate solution when most people 
affected had already made separate versions for 1.9.0.

It's reasonable to aspire to it, just like maintaining a package that
works under S-PLUS and R is reasonable to aspire to.  I think the
recommendation is that it's not worth the effort, given the short period
of time it will be useful.

I'm confused (not for the first time).  I can see that namespaces are an 
additional problem, but I thought the original question was about 
defining an S4 generic "start." This  would conflict (and override?) the 
S3 generic in base, which I don't think is allowed in 1.9.0. Until 
recently I have been overriding the start function in base (and some 
others) with my own S3 generic, and have just gone through a rather 
lengthy exercise to  rename these functions and some objects and other 
methods so that things do work in 1.9.0. (They do also work in 1.8.1.)

Will S3 and S4 generics for start co-exist? What happens to all the S3 
methods for start if the S4 generic is loaded? Won't this break a lot of 
code other than mine?

That's not what the subject line says, and the problem I was addressing is
that the NAMESPACE file needs to be different in 1.8.1 and 1.9.0-to-be.

There should be no problem with an S4 generic, as it calls the actual
existing S3 generic as its default S4 method.  It's done for plot(), for
example.  What will not work is having a different S3 generic of the same
name in a different namespace (including in the residual non-namespace).

Ok. Will two S4 generics co-exist? Perhaps the S4 generics should be 
defined in base just in case someone else wants to to have an S4 start 
method too?  (This would apply to a lot of other S3 generics in addition 
to start.)

Would you be willing to post a brief summary of comparative timings?

I have thought at times that it may be worthwhile collecting
comparative timings for different combinations of
                 processor/OS/memory size and speed/
on "typical" tasks in R.  As with any benchmark the results will
artificial but they can be of some help when considering what hardware
to purchase.  Bioconductor users may find it particularly helpful to
be able to evaluate how much they will need to pay to be able to
analyze large data sets reasonably quickly.

One easily-obtained timing is at the end of
$RSRC/tests/Examples/base-Ex.Rout after 'make;make check'.

Clearly, I disagree in some areas. But you raise an interesting, but perhaps
unintended, question:

Do we think that R is a programming language in its own right where we seek
to develop code and then build on that code for example in a object oriented
way? 

Or, is R a mechanism for combining lots of C/C++/Fortran libraries (written
by suitably qualified experts) at the command line in an easy to use
interpreted fashion in order to crunch the numbers and display them nicely?

Surely, if it's a speed issue we should try to help to make R faster for
these sorts of problems rather than just bailing out into C at the first
opportunity?

Message-ID: <972.1077905746@www28.gmx.net>


Dear Prof. Ripley,

Thank you for reminding me to the possibility to place the dots as first
argument.
If this is the solution against partial argument matching, we e.g. cannot
safely define a plot method which gives a demo plot in case of no object
(because we have to obey the class paramter conventions).

plot.someobject <- function(x=NULL, ...)

# another example would be paramter pairs where the second one is optional
like in 

plot.someobject(xAndOry, yOptional=NULL, ...)  # the standard plot(x,
y=NULL, ...) is a safe exception

# I agree that such examples can be avoided, but I ran into my problem after
6 years experience with S.
# My actual example had the following structure

makeoutput <- function(outchannel=NULL, ...){
	if (is.null(outchannel))
		outchannel <- activechannel
	## for each in ... output to outchannel
}

# as outchannel was usually specified and only occasionally the default
used, 
# it was more 'natural' (and lazy) to call it 
makeoutput(mychannel, ...)

# compared to 
makeoutput(..., outchannel=mychannel)


# standard use is
makeoutput(thischannel, element1name=element1content,
element2name=element2content)

# with an option to send to the active channel as default called like
makeoutput(element1name=element1content, element2name=element2content)

# calling this as
do.call("makeoutput", ll) # where ll <- list(out=outcontent,
whatever=whatevercontent)

# actually generates the nonsense call
makeoutput(outchannel=outcontent, whatever=whatevercontent)


# I still find it difficult to write reliable code in R. 
# I am always afraid to run into something like 

> # simple example for dangerous partial list matching
> 
> increment.counters <- function(..., mycounters){
+ inclist <- list(...)

Essentially, yes they can coexist and there is no need to predefine S4
generics just in case someone wants to write methods.  As I said, cases
like plot() and summary() get used in lots of places (although plot() is
AFAIR defined in methods).

My answer is: "we think that R is a programming language in
its own right where we seek to develop code and then build on that
code".  Whether object orientation is a good approach is a completely
different issue.  (note: I've spent significant amounts of time with
S4 classes on 2 projects, this may color my attitudes in non-obvious
ways).

For the general setting, think Python and SWIG.  Why not both?

Are you volunteering?  I'll never find the time in the near future.

Generalized optimization is very hard (or: high risk for possibly
little gain).   Specific examples/contexts are easy, of course, with
the ease narrowing as the scope of speedup narrows. 

R has improved beyond where I thought it would go back when I first
started using it (8 or 9 years? its been a while), but
across-the-board improvements in performance have always taken time.

That one is I think rather too artificial, as it contains few even
moderately large examples, and is dominated by a few atypical tasks.

I tend to use the sum of the MASS scripts as an informal timing: ch06.R is 
also a pretty good indicator.

I think you will find that BLAS differences are pretty small in real-life 
analyses, or at least I always have.

I think it's doable but a very big task.  Python had a head start
because Python has always been byte compiled to its own set of byte
codes.  This means the semantics evolved in a way that is more
supportive of compilation (things like being able to reliably identify
which variables are local, no lazy evaluation, etc.).  In addition
what seems to constitute the Python C core seems to be smaller than
the R core, the bits in base+nmath, say, by about a factor of 5.
Overall I think it would probably be about an order of magnitude
harder to get R to a state comparable to Jython.  That is before
starting to worry about packages needed to do anything useful.  You
can read about what was involved in creating Jython and do the math
yourself....

Once we get the R byte code compiler fully operational things may
eventually become easier since we may be able to the move some things
now done in C out into R where they are easier to maintain and could
then be automatically handled by an appropriate compiler back end.
Getting to a pure Java or pure .NET/mono setting is still likely to be
a fairly dauting task for a while.

Best,

luke

I was able to confirm the error on RH8.0 Linux and the segfault on 
Windows.

Note that PCRE is not being used, and if you add perl=TRUE to your [g]sub 
calls you get correct results extremely fast.

The segfault is occurring in regexec, that is in the GNU regex code 
included in R.  I am not clear it is worth spending any time on trying to 
find the problem in that code as

- you can use perl=TRUE as an alternative
- we will be replacing the GNU regex code in due course to cope with 
internationalization issues.

Thanks for clarifying that; I hadn't realised.

Sounds fine.  Do you think either of the following are worth
doing in the meantime?

  - Add an strsplit() variant with PCRE (perhaps this
    problem is be related to PR#6601; and the speed might be
    nice anyway).

  - Add options(pcre) so the potentially bad code can be
    avoided without explicitly setting perl=TRUE every time.

Worth considering, as least.

No, as unfortunately the definitions are slightly different and there are
a lot of usages of the POSIX regexps in the base R code (and elsewhere).

I would expect that usages with more than 10000 chars in one string were
rare, and indeed were not supported for most of R's life.  This is yet
another one of those issues where the very limited development resources
come into play.

Subject: [Rd] Line splitting in system() (PR#6624)
Message-ID: <20040228153333.7B94410419@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

According to the manual, system() splits output lines into
8096-char chunks; under UNIX, actually seems to return 8094
chars, and drop the 8095th.  Spot missing digits in:

  x2 <- 
    system("perl -e 'print \"0123456789\"x10000'",
    intern=T)

Looks like a bug in the code to remove newlines at
src/unix/sys-unix.c:218 -- fgets() reads size-1 characters
and adds null, so strlen(buf)<size always true.  Testing for
'\n' explicitly is probably better (deals with 8094 chr + \n
case) -- it turns out the win32 code already does this
anyway.  (IIRC the read>0 condition in the win32 code would
be redundant but I copied it anyway to be safe.)

Anyway, rather trivial diff below.  Both manpages should
probably say 8095 rather than 8096, I think.

Confirmed for R-devel too. Thanks for the fix, will apply in due
course. Notice that the same fix handles the case where the final line
is not \n-terminated:

> nchar(x2)
 [1] 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 8094 2859
> sum(nchar(x2))
[1] 99987
> length(nchar(x2))
[1] 13

I.e. we're losing a character in every block, including the last,
short, one.

Subject: [Rd] digamma with negative arguments (PR#6626)
Message-ID: <20040229211502.EAF3AED90@slim.kubism.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Chanseok Park
Version: 1.8.1
OS: linux-gnu
Submission from: (NULL) (130.127.112.183)


digamma with any negative value does not give a right answer.
It gives -1.797693e+308 for any negative arguments.

For example, digamma(-1.1) gives  -1.797693e+308.

The right answer should be 10.15416

This bug can be easily fixed by using the following digamma identity.

digamma(x) = digamma(1-x) - pi/tan(pi*x) ## if x is negative

> digamma(-1)
[1] -1.797693e+308

## if we use the above math identity, we have the right answer 
##     for any negative arguments.
> 
> x= -1.1
>  digamma(1-x) - pi/tan(pi*x) ## if x is negative

Subject: [Rd] Schedule for R 1.9.0
Message-ID: <x2vflpd1cj.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


The process leading up to the release of 1.9.0 is detailed below.
Package maintainers may want to take notice of important dates and
make sure that their packages still work with the alpha/beta releases
or work on making a 1.9.x comaptible version.

As usual, everybody is encouraged to try out the preliminary releases
and report back so that we can get the last wrinkles ironed out before
release.

Mar 7:

    Declare start of release process. The build process is assumed to
    be essentially in place at this time.

    There is a "grand feature" freeze (minor tweaks can be applied,
    but no wholesale restructuring or API changes). Notice that
    wrapping a package in a namespace is a grand feature, and so is
    meddling with the event loop.

    Package maintainers should start adapting to any changes in base.

    Start making R-1.9.0alpha.tgz packages automatically available.

Mar 21:

    Feature freeze, simultaneously on base and recommended packages.
    It is assumed that all recommended packages pass their checks at
    this point. The API should not be touched.

    Start making R-1.9.0beta.tgz packages automatically available.


Mar 28:

    Code freeze. Only critical and/or trivial bugs fixed from this
    time onwards. Configure/make should only be touched in
    emergencies.

Apr 4:

    Release.
