Is this a temporary bug or something we should try to work around in the
configure code?

...and said maintainer (TL) could probably be excused for prioritizing
maintenance base R and recommended packages up to the release of
1.7.1. 

The report is #2386, I assume? 

Notice that one of your (FEH's) fixes is only easy if the statement
"whereas I believe that the ace algorithm does allow for categorical
response variables" is taken at face value. Checking that it is
actually correct could take a bit longer...

Hi,

I hope I haven't got this wrong, but I don't think one needs Perl 
installed if they install the "precompiled" packages for Windows right?

I'm just wondering if the first sentence in the "R Installation and 
Administration" can be re-worded a bit so newbies won't get confused....

Ah I see the confusion.  I am taking it you are reading the "R 
Installation and Administration", Section 5.1.  It says "Installing source 
packages requires that Perl 5.004 or later be installed."  Note the 
keywords "source packages".  It means if you want to download the "source 
codes" of the package(s), i.e. a tarball file, and compile the package 
yourself, then you will need Perl.

Most, if not all, packages on CRAN have a "pre-compiled" windows version, 
i.e. a ZIP file.  That is why the easiest way is to install under Rgui, as 
the default URL setting in Rgui is to look under the appropriate directory 
in which pre-compiled package files located.

An alternative is to download the precompiled zip file and unzip them into 
your R library folder.

Right.

I've rewritten it from this:

> "Installing source 
>packages requires that Perl 5.004 or later be installed."  

to this:

"Packages may be distributed in source form or compiled binary form.
Installing source packages requires that compilers and tools
(including Perl 5.004 or later) be installed. Binary packages are
platform specific and generally need no special tools to install, but
see the documentation for your platform for details."

I hope that's clearer, but I'm not sure...

The following verifies that my local version of ace (see below) with the fixes works when y is categorical.

Message-ID: <20030602035734.GC963412@genome.cbs.dtu.dk>

Hi,

I have quite some trouble with the package methods.
"Environments" in R are a convenient way to emulate
pointers (and avoid copies of large objects, or of
large collections of objects). So far, so good,
but the package methods is becoming more (and more)
problematic to work with. Up to version R-1.7.0,
slots that were environments were still references
to an environment, but I discovered in a recent 
R-patched that this is not the case any longer:
environments as slots are now copied (increasing
the memory consumption by more than three fold in my case).
The (excessive) duplication (as a simple example
shown below demonstrates it) is now enforced
(as environments are copied too) !!!

I am not at all sure it is clearer.  There are only binary packages in
common use for Windows (given that MacOS < X is only bug-fixed for 
1.7.x, and in any case excluded from that section).

Newcomers do need to learn some of the R terminology, and avoiding this 
one will only defer the problem a step or so.  Things like learning that
there are other OSes in the world than the one they use are necessary to 
make sense of R's docs.

Subject: [Rd] wishlist: add get_seed() function to standalone R library
	(PR#3160)
Message-ID: <200306020736.h527aX2b001447@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Hsiu-Khuern Tang
Version: 1.7.0
OS: Debian GNU/Linux unstable
Submission from: (NULL) (66.32.185.71)


Hi all,

   This report is about the use of R as a standalone library, for linking with a
C program, for example.

   I have found it useful to be able to save the seeds of a random number
generator and restore it in a subsequent invocation of that program.  This
ensures continuity from one invocation to the next.  The file
src/nmath/standalone/sunif.c contains the function set_seed() for setting the
seeds of the Marsaglia-multicarry RNG; it would be nice to have get_seed()
defined simply as follows:

void get_seed(unsigned int *i1, unsigned int *i2)
{
    *i1 = I1; *i2 = I2;
}

Also, Rmath.h will have to contain the function prototype declaration for
get_seed.

Thanks a lot!

Best,
Hsiu-Khuern Tang.

My aim was to introduce the terminology here.  The section didn't
mention the distinction between source and binary, and it should do
that.  "Source" means something very specific to a developer, but it
has a more generalized meaning too, and we shouldn't assume that
people installing packages are developers.

I don't see how the original is as good in this regard as the
replacement, but I'd have no objection if you rewrote it to make it
clearer, as long as the source/binary distinction is in there
somewhere.

The memory growth seems real, but its connection to "environments as
slots" is unclear.

The only recent change that sounds relevant is the modification to
ensure that methods are evaluated in an environment that reflects the
lexical scope of the method's definition.  That does create a new
environment for each call to a generic function, but has nothing to do
with slots being environments.

It's possible there is some sort of "memory leak" or extra copying
there, but I'm not familiar enough with the details of that code to say
for sure.

Notice that the following workaround has no bad effects on memory
(suggesting that the extra environment in evaluating generics may in
fact be relevant):

R> setClass("A", representation(a="matrix"))
[1] "A"
R> aa <- matrix(600^2, 50)
R> a1 <- new("A")
R> a1@a <- aa
R> gc()
         used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb)
Ncells 370247  9.9     531268 14.2
Vcells  87522  0.7     786432  6.0



The general solution for dealing with large objects is likely to involve
some extensions to R to allow "reference" objects, for which the
programmer is responsible for any copying.

Environments themselves are not quite adequate for this purpose, since
different "references" to the same environment cannot have different
attributes.

That was (just) prior to 1.7.0.

You have managed to store Laurant's 140MB matrix in less than 1MB!:-)

If you use matrix(0, 600^2, 50) you get essentially the same pattern
as Laurant did.

Wrapping them in lists is the easiest way to deal this this.

Subject: [Rd] mva:princomp.default not set correctly (PR#3168)
Message-ID: <200306021517.h52FHO2b009165@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Andrew Irwin
Version: 1.7.0
OS: Win98
Submission from: (NULL) (165.230.175.97)



It is impossible to set both xlim and ylim in princomp or princomp.default.

For example
  data(USArrests)
  biplot(princomp(USArrests))
works fine, but
  biplot(princomp(USArrests), xlim=c(-0.4, 0.4), ylim=c(-0.5,0.4) )
does not do what I would expect -- the ylim gets ignored.

The offending bit of code from mva:princomp.default seems to be

    if (missing(xlim) && missing(ylim)) 
        xlim <- ylim <- rangx1 <- rangx2 <- range(rangx1, rangx2)
    else if (missing(xlim)) 
        xlim <- rangx1
    else ylim <- rangx2


This if .. else if .. else clause is not written the way I think it should be
written.  The else clause should only be executed if ylim is missing, but it
will be executed if xlim and ylim are both present.

Suggested rewrite:

    if (missing(xlim) && missing(ylim)) 
        xlim <- ylim <- rangx1 <- rangx2 <- range(rangx1, rangx2)
    else if (missing(xlim)) 
        xlim <- rangx1
    else if (missing(ylim))
        ylim <- rangx2

ifelse clause might be better, but less readable.

Cheers,

Andrew

Yes, wrap them up in a list is good. You can not use environments
directly for different reasons. Try to do it, then quit R and save the
workspace and then restart R to reload the workspace and you will see
the problem (at least this was the case for R v1.6.2).

Another comment: A while ago I compared storing environments in lists,
i.e. ref$.env or ref[[".env"]], with storing them as attributes, i.e.
attr(ref, ".env"),  and found that it is faster to retrieve an
environment variable if it is stored as an attribute. This might the
useful to know if your going access your "referenced" data many times.

This is not about princomp.default at all!  That snippet of code does not
appear there.

Please do check against the S-PLUS original of biplot.default: this is in
biplot.default.  I very much doubt if you understand the intentions
(not that I do either).

Since when were your expectations the determinant of a bug?

Sorry, Brian, but: Pot, kettle....

As far as I can see, this is not equivalent to S-PLUS's logic. For
that, the 3rd line should read

        if (!missing(ylim))

So in S-PLUS, xlim gets ignored if ylim is specified, whereas in R it
is vice versa. I suspect that neither case is desirable?

Correct.  Oh, well.  Here's the less optimistic version:

R> setClass("A", representation(a="matrix"))
[1] "A"
R> aa = new("A")
R> aa@a <-  matrix(0, 600^2, 50)
R> gc()
           used  (Mb) gc trigger  (Mb)
Ncells   368189   9.9     667722  17.9
Vcells 36086939 275.4   54357610 414.8


A little exploration in gdb didn't show much that was surprising.  Yes,
the code copies the matrix to assign it as a slot, but nothing showed up
that was obviously much different from a similar computation that didn't
use classes & methods.

For example, a "stripped-down" analogue to assigning a slot is to assign
an attribute.  To compare with the above (both from a new R session):

R> tt = list(a=1,b=2)
R> attr(tt, "a") <- matrix(0, 600^2, 50)
R> gc()
           used  (Mb) gc trigger  (Mb)
Ncells   367539   9.9     667722  17.9
Vcells 36086917 275.4   54357588 414.8

The indication is that the two compuations are roughly identical, as one
would hope.  In either case, the behavior seems to be somewhere in
between that of the minimalist assignment of the matrix and the
computations for new("A",...).  Which is what one would expect, if there
is some additional copying going on somewhere in dispatching or
evaluating the method for initialize().

But this hardly seems to justify a diatribe, and it doesn't point to a
likely high-leverage fix.

Without some more specific guidance or ideas, a lot of time could be
spent on this without much chance of profit.

Yes, that's what the current OOP package in Omegahat does.  But it's not
a long-term solution, because now you have a list object, which is not
what you intended.

There seem to be no instances of the actual virus-laden message in
either the r-devel or r-help archives.

This is a new variant (SoBig.C) of the SoBig virus which started
going the rounds a few weeks ago. That one was always "from"
support@microsoft.com, and it picked random "To:" address from
the user's [Windows] system. The new one does much the same, but
this time it also picks a random address to mail "from".

Hence those of you out there who subscribe to r-help or r-devel
and have been infected will from time to time send a virus attachment
as if "from" r-help or r-devel. When this hits a site that spots the
virus and bounces back an error message, the latter will be sent to the
apparent sender and so we will all get it -- without the attachment if
the site has done its job.

This new variant has been out since 31 May, and is not picked up by
virus-screening software capable of detecting the earlier version.
Only signature files updated since 31 May can do this, so you have
to update your virus signature files.

(Or migrate to Linux).

Best wishes to all,
Ted.
[PS the word is that this latest variant will expire on 8 June]

Hola!

I downloaded latest of 1.7.1 today, and are compiling under windows

The file /src/gnuwin32/INSTALL
says that one can run make check immediately after make.

This fails, because testing the base package uses Orthodont 
from package nlme, and so make check fails if run before
make recommended. This should maybe be changed in this file INSTALL.

What makes you think that is a bug?

?"if" and help("if") work

`An Introduction to R' says

For a feature specified by special characters, the argument must be
enclosed in double or single quotes, making it a ``character string'':

and that is true for a few other examples, as all good books (e.g. 
MASS) point out.

To be precise, we should probably insert "or a reserved word"
in that sentence. 

The point is that parsing occurs prior to the logic that runs help on
the (deparsed) argument, so it's technically no different from "-if"
or "!for" which are also syntactically invalid. The question mark is
just another operator at this stage.

Subject: [Rd] standard errors from glm (PR#3180)
Message-ID: <200306032250.h53MoG2b024417@pubhealth.ku.dk>


In the iterative weighted least squares loop of the glm.fit function,
a QR decomposition of the matrix X*sqrt(w) is obtained at each iteration,
using fitted values of the mean response mu from the previous interation. 
Here "X" is the design matrix, w = wt*(d(mu)/d(eta))/variance(mu), 
"wt" is the vector of weights, and "d(mu)/d(eta)" is the derivative 
of mu wrt the linear predictor eta.  Upon convergence, the most recent 
QR decomposition of X*sqrt(w) is returned and this is later used by 
the function summary.glm to compute standard errors.

The QR decomposition being returned by glm.fit uses the fitted values from 
parameter estimates at the (final-1)st iteration. But don't we want 
fitted values from parameter estimates at the final iteration?  
I tried inserting the following lines upon completion of the iterative 
weighted least squares loop:

    mu.eta.val <- mu.eta(eta)
    w <- sqrt((weights[good] * mu.eta.val[good]^2)/variance(mu)[good])
    newQR<-qr(x[good, ] * w)

My standard errors based on newQR$qr agree with the standard
errors I had computed manually from the final fits.
Has anyone else encountered this issue? Thanks in advance 
for any clarifications.

Brad

Well, yes, perhaps.  OTOH it's a whole lot easier just to tighten the
tolerance for convergence, which has been done for 1.7.1

For 1.8.0, in fact.

Hmm. Would we want that for 1.7.1 too? There is some use in having
output unchanged in the patch series, but not if it is (too)
inaccurate, I suppose?

BTW, are we sure that tightening convergence criteria also works in
the divergent case? Probably not. If the parameter estimate doubles on
each iteration, the SEs could be seriously out of whack if they refer
to the parameters from last time around (Hauck-Donner effect
notwithstanding).

This is clearly stated to be a connection problem. If it ever works it is
not an R problem, and that is the case (as you say and we find).

Please don't abuse R-bugs, which is for bugs in R, not bugs in your
internet connectivity nor even for bugs in contributed packages such as
tseries.

It `works' here, but there seems to be a problem in tseries:

>      x <- get.hist.quote(instrument = "^spc", start = "1998-01-01",

time series starts 1998-01-02
Error in Ops.difftime((end - start) * frequency, 1.01) :

because get.hist.quote passes classed objects as start and end to ts().

You have a spelling problem and a new-line problem in your code!

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.20.0306041415200.2329-100000@santiam.dfci.harvard.edu>

Hello ...

I've noticed that some of our Bioconductor code was running drastically
slower under current R-devel vs. current R-patched - one example is below
using a ttest.  I have the following snippet of code that demonstrates the
problem while avoiding "real" code that takes an extremely long time to
finish on R-devel:

library(genefilter)
data(eset)
eset$cov1
z <- ttest(eset$cov1, p=0.01)
gf <- filterfun(z)
system.time(genefilter(eset, gf))

(this requires the genefilter & Biobase packages from Bioconductor)

Using R-1.7.0p I had the following output:
> data(eset)
> eset$cov1
 [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
> z <- ttest(eset$cov1, p=0.01)
> gf <- filterfun(z)
> system.time(genefilter(eset, gf))
[1] 41.73  2.04 44.45  0.00  0.00

And using R-devel, I have:
> data(eset)
> eset$cov1
 [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

> gf <- filterfun(z)
> system.time(genefilter(eset, gf))
[1] 80.56  4.20 85.12  0.00  0.00

Any ideas what might be causing this?

Thanks

Are you making use of S4 classes?  If so see the threads on slowness in 
R-patched in the last 48 hours: R-devel will be similar to R-patched was
the last time a branch update was done.

What is that?  We do have 1.7.1 beta now.

There was a bug leading to non-caching of methods, in the r-patched code
from a few days ago.

A branch update would have put the changes into R-devel also.

The problem has been partly fixed in the current code committed to
R-patched (and some further fixes are in the works).

(Sorry, this was discussed on r-core, so didn't yet get to the r-devel
list.)

Please check the email headers on that message: R-bugs almost certainly
did not send you an email.

However, *you* have spammed a list with your reply.  We understand your 
annoyance: please do be aware that there is a lot of email spoofing going 
on, but I am getting far more messages such as yours in `reply' to 
messages that were spoofed than real spoofed messages.

Let's hope for your sake that a few hundred people don't complain to you
about your spamming them.

Actually, I realized that the particular R-pached I was using was from May
23.  I used my June 4th version of R-patched (aka R-1.7.1 beta) and it
matches my June 4th version of R-devel, more or less:
> system.time(genefilter(eset, gf))
[1] 79.27  3.98 85.24  0.00  0.00

But, my 2003-05-23 version of r-patched produces a value that is roughly
half of that.

Not sure if that helps out at all, but the current r-patched and r-devel
is definitely slower in this then it was about a week and a half ago.

Right.  The fix committed earlier today caught some of the non-caching,
but there are still some cases that are slipping through.  So it matters
"when" on June 4 the code was sampled.  But either way, not all the
problems are yet caught.

Fortunately, this has finally got me to instrument some checks that
method selection stays in the C code on the second time through an
expression.

By tomorrow morning, there should be a committed version that has no
unneccessary S-level method selection (at least on my tests, using Doug
& Saikat's lme4 code).  It would be very helpful if you could check
again after I send some mail around.

Note, the R-admin manual tells you *not* to use that version of gcc.

Now you know why the INSTALL file says

  The main source of information on installation is the `R Installation
  and Administration Manual', an HTML copy of which is available as file
  `doc/html/R-admin.html'.  Please read that before installing R.  But
  if you are impatient, read on but please refer to the manual to
  resolve any problems.

So, why not follow that advice?  Preferably, *before* sending a bug 
report!

FYI, the gcc Sparc Solaris bug is fixed in 3.2.3 and 3.3.

Some revisions were committed this morning to R-patched that appear to
fix the problems with caching methods, which apparently were the cause
of the slow-downs.

The test I've been using for caching runs Doug & Saikat's lme example
from lme4.  See attached file.  The same style test could be used for
any particular expression.  There are still a couple of peculiarities --
for some reason it takes 3 executions of some expressions involving
callNextMethod to cache everything.  And, of course, other tests may
raise new issues.  But Doug and Saikat have done a good job of using
lots of features!  Many thanks.

The current code passes check-all here.  Please let me know of any
problems.  I'll be away the rest of today, but back tomorrow.

Running the test tha I had been doing shows amazing speed gains.  It is
about 5-6 times faster then my May 23 version of R-patched and thus
obviously much faster then the one from yesterday.

I also ran our tests and found that the new version is faster than
1.7.0 on those tests.  Thanks very much for your work on overcoming
that problem John.

Hi, 

I tried your example from the website (http://www.r-project.org/) and I get the
following error message:

> f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b"))
> split(affybatch.example, f)

Same with split.AffyBatch:

ncol, nrow, cdfName

What can I do?

Sincerely,

At a guess it is one of the BioConductor packages, for which that is not 
the master URL.

Not the current version of R, might well be the problem.

Well, I guess I got confused with all the frames on your website.  Here's the
URL: http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/affy/html/AffyBatch-class.html.  I
used your search engine and got directly to that page assuming that I was still
on the R website and not on some unspecified contributed website.

Message-ID: <8CBAA121CEB4D5118CB200508BB2BBEF540368@xmx8lonib.lonib.commerzbank.com>

I make quite a lot of use of irregular time-series, and had already spent a
bit of time writing an 'its' class when the 'irts' class was released via
the package 'tseries'.

I have experimented with the 'irts' class, and have some practical issues
with its use.  In some applications of irregular time-series (in my case
these are financial and econometric) there are many instances where it is
useful to consider them as an extension (subclass) of the class 'matrix',
using S4 class inheritance.  This is also useful in printing. 

The 'its' class I have written is an S4 extension of the matrix class, using
a single slot for a POSIX  dates vector, which time-indexes the rows.  The
practical advantage of this, compared to the 'irts' class, is that the
matrix methods are inherited.

In addition to file operations and some simple functions, I have also
written a number of method extensions for this 'its' class, including [.its,
[[.its, intersect, union, diff, lag.

Is there value in such a package, given the resemblance of 'its' to the
existing 'irts' class?  I would be happy to contribute it, and provide some
maintenance.

Subject: [Rd] stuck tcltk scrollbars under Windows XP
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030606072039.01ed78a0@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R-devel list members,

I've encountered a problem with my Rcmdr package under Windows XP and could 
use some advice:

The Rcmdr package uses the tcltk package to create menus and dialog boxes. 
My standard procedure when a dialog is created is to grab the focus -- e.g., by

     tkfocus(top)
     tkgrab(top)

(Here, top is a top-level window -- say, containing one or more 
scrollbars.) When the window is closed, I release the focus, destroy the 
window, and return the focus to another window -- e.g.,

     tkgrab.release(top)
     tkdestroy(top)
     . . .
     tkfocus(.commander)

(Here .commander is a top-level window residing in the global environment.)

This procedure works fine under Windows 2000 -- where I've done most of the 
testing of the Rcmdr package under Windows -- but I received a report of a 
problem from a Windows XP user, who noted that scrollbars tend to get 
stuck. I was able to reproduce the problem intermittently on an XP system, 
and found that the problem appears to go away when I remove the calls to 
tkgrab() and tkgrab.release().

You can test for the problem with the following code:

     window1 <- tktoplevel()
     window2 <- tktoplevel()
     xFrame <- tkframe(window2)
     xScroll <- tkscrollbar(xFrame, repeatinterval=5, command=function(...) 
tkyview(xBox, ...))
     xBox <- tklistbox(xFrame, height=4,
         selectmode="single", background="white", exportselection="FALSE",
         yscrollcommand=function(...) tkset(xScroll, ...))
     for (x in letters) tkinsert(xBox, "end", x)
     onOK <- function() {
         tkgrab.release(window2)
         tkfocus(window1)
         tkdestroy(window2)
         }
     OKbutton <- tkbutton(window2, text="OK", width="12", command=onOK, 
default="active")
     tkgrid(xBox, xScroll, sticky="nw")
     tkgrid.configure(xScroll, sticky="ns")
     tkgrid(xFrame, sticky="w")
     tkgrid(OKbutton, sticky="w")
     tkselection.set(xBox, 0)
     tkbind(window2, "<Return>", onOK)
     tkfocus(window2)
     tkgrab(window2)

I find that I can make the scrollbar stick under Windows XP by repeatedly 
and rapidly pressing the scroll-down button. As mentioned, removing the 
calls to tkgrab() and tkgrab.release() seems to eliminate the problem.

I wonder whether anyone else has encountered this problem or has any 
insight into its source. Am I doing something wrong here? I could simply 
remove the calls to tkgrab() and tkgrab.release() throughout the package, 
or make them optional, perhaps checking for Windows XP via shell("ver", 
intern=TRUE)[2], but I'd rather solve the problem.

I've also had a report of tk windows failing to stay on top of the R-GUI 
SDI Console in Windows XP, but I haven't been able to duplicate this 
problem, and it has never occurred in my testing under Windows 2000 and 
Linux. Has anyone else experienced this behaviour?


Thanks,
  John

Yes, please! Either inside tseries, assuming Adrian is happy with that, or
outside. 

I use the 'padding irregular series with NAs' trick quite a bit and would
love to have its support.

I don't know TCL/TK well enough to know what tkgrab does in Windows
terms, but the general symptoms look as though events are being
missed.  When you click on something messages are generated for
mouse-down and mouse-up events; it looks as though some mouse-up
messages are being lost.

TK gets lost behind the MDI main window, but I haven't seen this yet
with SDI.  I haven't done a lot of testing, though...

We have an old issue on Windows which I haven't had the stamina to dig
into: On Unix, all Tcl event handling is keyed to the keyboard loop.
On Windows, we run a check for Tcl events "every once in a while".

I think it was Brian that implemented the Windows version and it
seemed like a good idea at the time. However, it breaks some things
where Tcl/Tk tends to assume atomic processing. E.g., this is behind
the code in the tkfaq demo (and elsewhere):

    txt <- tktext(tt, bg="white", font="courier")
    scr <- tkscrollbar(tt, repeatinterval=5,
                       command=function(...)tkyview(txt,...))
    ## Safest to make sure scr exists before setting yscrollcommand
    tkconfigure(txt, yscrollcommand=function(...)tkset(scr,...))

Where the point is that the text widget will otherwise generate an
event which results in a  call to tkset(scr,...), possibly before scr
exists.

In a Tcl script, there is no problem with this and the preferred idiom
is actually

text      .tt.txt -command {set .tt.scr} 
scrollbar .tt.scr -command {yview .tt.txt}

(although you can't run them like that individually on the wish
command line for the same reason as above).

I.e. Tcl scripts generally expect to run to completion before event
processing takes place. You could be bumping into something similar in
the function that calls tkgrab.

Professor Fox,

I can duplicate the scroll bar problem on WinXP Pro using R 1.7.1
Beta.

Try modifying the final lines in your code to the following and see if
it works under Win2k:

...
tkbind(window2, "<Return>", onOK)

# Here is the change
tkwm.deiconify(window2)
tkgrab.set(window2)
tkfocus(xBox)
tkwait.window(window2)

Using the above code, I seem to have eliminated the scroll bar
problem. This is the approach that I took with the tkSelectList()
function which I sent to you during our offline exchange.

Note that I have tkfocus() set to the scrollbar xBox and not to
window2, which results in the mouse scroll wheel working, whereas it
does not when the focus is set to window2.

Lastly, by using the tkwm.deiconify(...) function window2 is raised to
obtain focus.  That was a quirk that I found by experimentation.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Quick correction:

The sentence in the paragraph above should read:

"Note that I have tkfocus() set to the **ListBox** xBox..."

Sorry for any confusion.

Yes, I think so. There seem to be different ways to do these things and 
some work better than others, often for reasons that are not obvious in 
the beginning.

Dear Duncan,

Thanks for the confirmation. I assume that the scrollbar problem went away 
when the calls to tkgrab() and tkgrab.release() were removed. Is that right?

Regards,
  John

I've habitually defined scrollbars before the corresponding text boxes, but 
I suppose that the reverse problem (the scrollbar referring to the box 
before it exists) could occur. I don't seem to have encountered that 
problem, however.

Why should this problem arise with tkgrab? I don't issue the call to tkgrab 
until the whole window is defined. As well, I find it curious that the 
problem only seems to surface in Windows XP.

I wish that we could all forget about trying to get everything to work 
under Windows, except that nearly 100% of the people I deal with use it. If 
no better solution materializes, I'll set an option to suppress the calls 
to tkgrab and tkrelease. Does that seem reasonable?

By the way, thank you again for the wonderful tcltk package.

Regards,
  John

Dear Marc,

Thank you for the suggestions -- I'll try them out. I'd prefer to 
understand why things work as they do, for fear of introducing other 
problems. Focusing on the list box won't work for me, I think, since many 
of the Rcmdr dialogs have more than one list box.

Thanks again,
  John

Just tried that.  Things are better, but they aren't completely
solved.  If I click very quickly, then some of the mouse-up events are
missed.  Without the tkgrab, this doesn't cause a crash, but it does
leave the button stuck down, so the window starts scrolling
continuously.

Prof. Fox,

Glad to be of help, if indeed the above is of help. I am certainly in
agreement that I prefer to understand why things do what they do.

The resultant approach that I took in the tkSelectList() function I
wrote was through some trial and error using Peter's article from R
News (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf), Practical
Programming in Tcl and Tk by Welch and Effective Tcl/Tk Programming by
Harrison and McLennan.

What I found was perhaps biased by some quirks and perhaps differences
in the way in which the various window managers seem to work (ie.
between WinXP and RH 8.0/9).

I believe that the above modifications work in this situation given
the following considerations:

1. The use of tkwm.deiconify(window2) makes the window immediately
available ("raises it") for interaction once the grab/focus is set.
Lacking this command (even with the grab set) required me to actually
click on the ListBox window in order for it to respond to events. This
occurred even though it was already visually "on top" of all other
windows on the screen. 

2. The use of tkfocus(xBox) instead of tkfocus(window2) is simply a
choice in this case, since the initial object being interacted with is
the ListBox. If you have more than one bound object in a window (ie.
several ListBoxes, buttons, etc.), you can toggle/cycle between them
with the TAB key. In that case, each object in sequence gains focus
and the default bindings for the object are enabled.

3. The use of tkwait.window(window2) seems to provide an enhanced
level of priority in the processing of event signals.  Presuming that
you are waiting for the user to either make a selection or clear/close
the ListBox window, this seems a reasonable approach.  You would not
likely want to use this function in the case of a window that is to be
retained, since this call waits for the window to be destroyed before
continuing processing.


Not sure if that provides sufficient justification for the approach
that I took, but it does seem to work under two different OS's and two
different window managers, the latter of which seems to introduce a
level of variability in behavior.

Best regards,

Marc

Dear Mark,

After some experimentation, I found that the crucial change appears to be 
the call to tkwait.window. When I include this, the problem of sticking 
scrollbars in Windows XP seems to go away. Since the dialogs with 
scrollbars are always waiting for the user to press the OK or Cancel button 
to dismiss the dialog, using tkwait.window seems fine.

The call to tkwm.deiconify also appears to raise the dialog window more 
reliably, as you suggest.

In the absence of another solution, I'll bite the bullet and modify all of 
the dialogs in Rcmdr along these lines.

Thanks for your help,
  John

=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Subject: [Rd] R CMD check: is it error to setMethod for class not currently
 defined?
Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.1.20030607220218.00acc830@imaphost.wehi.edu.au>

Should R CMD check consider it an error to define a new method using 
setMethod for a class which is not currently defined? It seems to me that 
it would be best not to consider this an error.

What currently happens in that setMethod issues a warning, quite correctly. 
This warning produces an object 'last.warning'. Then R CMD check issues a 
WARNING that 'last.warning' is an undocumented code object.

Would it be a good idea to make R CMD check disregard the object 
'last.warning' when checking for undocumented code objects? If people 
agree, I could try to make a patch for the R CMD check code.

No I'm the one who was missed something. As the strsplit example shows, I 
could have got "*\\.txt" as I wanted in the help file by putting four 
backlashes, "*\\\\.txt", in the .Rd file.

There are still aspects though to the substitution of backlashes when going 
from the help file to running examples which seem unexpected to me. I tried 
out the following example.

In the example in the .Rd file:

c("\\\\","\\\","\\\\#","\\#","\#")
c("\\+","\\?","\\.","\\*","\\^","\\$","\\(","\\)","\\[","\\]","\\{","\\}","\\|","\\_")
c("\+","\?","\.","\*","\^","\$","\(","\)","\[","\]","\{","\}","\|","\_")
c("\\w","\\W","\\s","\\S","\\d","\\D","\\A","\\Z","\\b","\\B","\\G","\\n","\\r","\\f","\\t")
c("\w","\W","\s","\S","\d","\D","\A","\Z","\b","\B","\G","\n","\r","\f","\t")

This results in the help file:

c("\\","\\","\\#","\#","\#")
c("\+","\?","\.","\*","\^","\$","\(","\)","\[","\]","\{","\}","\|","\_")
c("\+","\?","\.","\*","\^","\$","\(","\)","\[","\]","{","}","\|","\_")
c("\w","\W","\s","\S","\d","\D","\A","\Z","\b","\B","\G","\n","\r","\f","\t")
c("\w","\W","\s","\S","\d","\D","\A","\Z","\b","\B","\G","\n","\r","\f","\t")

Executed by example():

c("\\", "\\", "\\#", "#", "#")
c("+", "?", ".", "*", "^", "$", "(", ")", "[", "]", "{", "}", "|", "_")
c("+", "?", ".", "*", "^", "$", "(", ")", "[", "]", "{", "}", "|", "_")
c("w", "W", "s", "S", "d", "D", "A", "Z", "\b", "B", "G", "\n", "\r", "\f", 
"    ")
c("w", "W", "s", "S", "d", "D", "A", "Z", "\b", "B", "G", "\n", "\r", "\f", 
"    ")

When going from the .Rd file to the help file, single backslashes are left 
as-is but double backslashes are converted to singles. So to get a double 
backslash one has to start with four backslashes. This is fine.

When going from the help file to rendered code, double backlashes are now 
left as-is. Single backslashes are removed, *except* for "\b", "\n", "\r" 
and "\f". Escaped t's, "\t" are converted to actual tabs.

Is this all as it is supposed to be? The conversion of \t to <tab> does 
seem a potential problem.

The conversion of \t to <tab> occurs in other examples of rendering code 
also, for example:

 > myfun <- function(x,pattern="\t") "hello"
 > args(myfun)
function (x, pattern = "        ")

Subject: [Rd] table( , exclude=NULL) for factor objects
Message-ID: <3EE1C869.25610.18BC94@localhost>

The NEWS file for R-1.7.0 says:

	table() now allows exclude= with factor arguments (requested by
	Michael Friendly).

But in a recent R-1.7.1beta:

> test <- c(1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,NA,NA,1,2,3,4,5)
> table(test)
test
1 2 3 4 5 
3 3 3 3 3 
> table(test, exclude=NULL)
test
   1    2    3    4    5 <NA> 
   3    3    3    3    3    2 
> table( as.factor(test), exclude=NULL)

1 2 3 4 5 
3 3 3 3 3 


so this seems not to work?

What is strange is that this seems to work in 
example(table).

Many thanks for your helpful comments.

To over-simplify the previous discussion a bit, you are emphasising that 
all the aliases written by promptMethods will be needed by future versions 
of the help system, so it is important that they be included in .Rd files 
documenting methods. I was saying that these aliases are very verbose.

I am not the only one having trouble with the aliases. I have looked 
through all the R packages that I know of that use S4 methods and can't 
find even one example of a documented method which preserves all the 
promptMethod style aliases. This may be partly because package authors 
aren't sure what they should be doing, but I think it has to be taken as a 
pretty strong statement from authors that the aliases don't produce a 
workable result with the online help system as it currently stands. The 
trouble I think is with the html package contents page, which very quickly 
becomes too long and cluttered to be useful if all the aliases are included.

Could we satisfy both needs, (i) to have a unique help alias associated 
with each method and (ii) to have a package contents page which is 
readable, by giving authors control over which aliases are included on the 
contents page? Could we have a new command \aliasonly{} for the .Rd files 
for aliases which are to be available to the help system but not listed on 
the contents page? Authors could use \alias{} for aliases which are to be 
listed and \aliasonly{} for aliases which aren't.

It might also be helpful to have an optional argument, as in 
\alias[optional.text]{}, to choose the text which is listed on the package 
contents page.

Some other comments on generic functions are interpolated below.

The need for extra arguments seems to increase with the complexity of the 
task which the generic function does. In R base most use of generic 
functions are for language-type functions like 'print' or 'summary', 
although there are also data analysis functions like 'anova', 'residuals' 
and 'coefficients'. In Bioconductor we are tying to use S4 generic 
functions to undertake some quite complex data analysis talks, for example 
the 'normalization' of a mult-array microarray experiment. Normalization 
means to adjust the data for unwanted systematic trends due to 
technological sources other than the genes and the treatments of interest. 
The generic function 'normalize' encapsulates a single unifying concept, 
but the implementation may differ considerably depending on the type of 
microarrays being used and the factors will seem important to adjust for.

We can and probably should consider using parameter-setting functions. But 
if we end up with a separate parameter-setting function for every class, 
and most users need to read the documentation for these functions, then we 
haven't really achieved a simplification.

Another consideration which seems to increase the importance of the methods 
relative to the generic function itself is the modular package style of 
development being used in R. If I am the first author to use the function 
name 'normalize', do I have the right to specify all the arguments I need 
for this function as part of the generic definition, or should I minimize 
the specified arguments to give other authors as much flexibility as possible?

One example of document which I have been using as a model is the 
documentation in R base for the S3 generic function 'residuals'. The 
?residuals document explains the concept in generic terms and limits the 
argument list to 'object' and '...'. One can then read the separate 
method-documents ?residuals.lm or ?residuals.glm for other arguments. I 
would be happy if we could do similar with S4 functions and methods.

It's actually not strange, but all consistent and according to help(table):

1) table() does show NA's only when they are factor levels, not
   when they are missing since that's what it's description says:
   it counts factor *levels*:

2) The `exclude' argument in table() is only used when table()'s
   arguments are not yet factors, i.e., not in this case.

Actually, there are several issues.

If two packages had a 'foo-methods' alias entry, we can still find them
(and in fact, the code in help() does so).  However, for multiple help
topic matches, we typically only display the first one, rather than
offering a selection menu, and I really think we should change this.

Re using 'foo-methods' as an alias, I am not sure whether this is
necessary in the long run.  To find out which methods are available, we
can use showMethod().  We should eventually [see below] be able to do
something like

  method ? f(x="character", y = "numeric")

to access the documentation object for the given signature, and there is
no guarantee that an f-methods Rd object really documents all methods
for the generic f in the package.  So I think eventually we should get
rid of the default foo-methods alias, and just dump the ones
corresponding to available methods.

Right, but perhaps there should still be \usage markup for S4 methods in
case people want to document methods with 'surprising arguments'.  One
idea would be to have

	\S4method{generic}{signaturelist}(arglist)

which could on output render to e.g.

	## Method for signature 'signaturelist':
	generic(arglist)

Why should it?  Packages could have an object called last.warning in
their environment---the last.warning created by warning() seems to end
up in .GlobalEnv ...

What seems to happen is that you have a package installed as a save
image which at save time creates a warning and hence last.warning in
.GlobalEnv.  The way installing as a save image works everything in
.GlobalEnv gets included in the package environment.  If for some reason
this produces something 'unwanted', it can still be removed e.g. from
inside the package load hook(s) (e.g., your .First.lib()).  The QC
tools, when working on installed packages, simply load and attach them,
and perform computations on what is available then.

Ideas along these lines have already been discussed in considerable
detail within R Core ...

In any case, I am confused: by 'the contents page' you mean the
00Index.html files used by the HTML help system, and not the INDEX file
which could be rendered when asking for help on a package?

Afaic, this is primarily an implementation issue of the HTML help
system.  I do not know its internal workings, but it would seems to me
that when going

	Packages => mva

we should get an HTML version of the Rd *index* and not a list of all
the aliases with the titles (note that the index is generated from
name/title pairs).

Note that the HTML help system in its current layout cannot support
dynamic documentation.  It is my understanding that R Core has decided
to move towards the latter, with the obvious consequences for the
former.

Going from help to rendered code means via example()?  What happens
there is that is R-ex file is *sourced*, i.e., parsed and evaluated, so
what we see is what R does.

I cannot reproduce this: if I add

f <- function(x = "\t") "hello"
args(f)

to eda/R-ex/line.R and do example("line", "eda") I get

line> f <- function(x = "\t") "hello"

line> args(f)
function (x = "\t") 
NULL

without the tab being expanded ...

Fair enough. What was confusing me was that what is echoed by example() is 
not exactly the same as what is in the R-ex file. I guess what happens is 
that the commands are cleaned up by removing extraneous backlashes. So what 
is executed by 'example()' is not necessarily identical as a string of 
characters to what is in the R-ex file but is functionally equivalent to it 
as an R expression.

There seems to be a separate issue with tabs in Windows, see below.

The expansion of \t to tab may be specific to Windows. The above examples 
reproduce for me in
Windows (R 1.7.0 patched or R 1.6.2) but don't reproduce in linux (R 
1.7.0). The simplest example of expansion in R for Windows (R 1.7.0 patched 
or R 1.6.2) is to type

"\t"

at the R prompt. This produces the printout

[1] "   "

which contains an actual tab. In R 1.7.0 for linux typing

"\t"

at the R prompt prints as

[1] "\t"

as expected.

I found that if a numeric vector is used to set the line type in
segments(), then any NA values get plotted with a particular pattern,
rather than omitted as usually happens with NAs. Similarly, 

  plot(rnorm(5),type="l",lty=as.numeric(NA))

does plot a line, curiously enough not with the same pattern as

  plot(1:7,2:8)
  segments(1:5,2:6,4:8,3:7,lty=c(NA,1:4))

lty=NA (i.e. logical NA) gives an error.

Thanks for this. Including the code 'rm(last.warning)' in the right place 
solves the problem.

This is not what is intended.  R_ShowMessage should be showing messages
in a suitable way: for console-based systems that should probably be an 
alert box.  By not having R_ConsoleFile set R_WriteConsole is used.
I don't think you can assume that all users of that code will have a 
stderr.

NO!  That also redirects all the R warnings and errors to /dev/null, and
is definitely undesirable.

If you find the warnings (*not* errors) annoying, don't misuse R by
supplying incorrect arguments.  Use e.g. environment variables to pass
your input.

This happens on all OSes (I have access to) with Tcl/Tk 8.4.x: it has been
discussed before and I recall the solution proposed was to remove the code

Hi everyone,

It's a very minor point, but could we ensure that eigen and La.eigen
return a *matrix* for the "vectors" component of the list by including a
"drop = FALSE", as specified in the help file, ie put

    list(values = z$values[ord], vectors = if (!only.values) z$vectors[, 
        ord, drop = FALSE])

Thanks, Jonathan.

We certainly can.  (svd seems to do this already.)

Could you (next time) supply a test example for the regression suite, 
though?

Dear Paul,
Hello R Maintainers,

I'm for the first time here and I hope its the right place to give the

The contributed R-package "dse" fails to be loaded from the menu button(s).
The reason is that it contains 4 sub-packages, dse1, dse2 ..., so the

Try it ... - It is possible to correct this? Many thanks.

Hello,

Sorry a second time again,

Maybe I have to add that I'm running R under Windows 2000/XP, and
that the download works properly under 1.062 but not under 1.070.

Is this on Windows with R 1.7.0 as originally release? There is a know 
problem with bundles in that case (and a work around), although the 
error message you are reporting is not the one I have seen reported before.

All you need to do is to *read* the ReadMe in the CRAN area.  It says

Be aware that the binary versions of the bundles VR and dse
cannot be updated using update.packages() or install.packages()
in R-1.7.0, because of a bug in rw1070: you need to download the
zip files manually from ./rw1070bundles and unzip them (manually) 
in your local rw1070/library.

...although perhaps not for this particular reason, but because
the demo is misleading people to believe that it is a useful method
for finding files. tkgetOpenFile/tkgetSaveFile are much better for
that, tkfilefind is really just a demo of interfacing to nontrivial
Tcl code. So if it doesn't even work, it is a definite candidate for
removal.

The same error was reported on OpenBSD 3.2 with a newer compiler:

but I though to report for 3.3 cdrom release.

glm() seems to converge, even when it shouldn't.  I am trying to fit a model

but they seem to converge in R ...

Maybe the attachment was stripped by mailman. Hopefully the diff (which is now 
attached inline at the end of this message) will clear up all of these 
questions.
Perhaps the web page http://www.r-project.org/mail.html should be changed 
then? It currently says that r-help is for, among other things: "enhancements 
and patches to the source code and documentation of R"

The original code itself makes this assumption. On all non-aqua UNIX systems, 
the code unconditionally sets R_ConsoleFile to stderr. My code simply moves 
up the location of that setting.

Why is it a misuse to pass arguments to an R program? Every modern interpreter 
on UNIX systems allows this functionality. If you have an R program that 
requires 4 input variables, it is quite inconvenient to require the user to 
set them all as environment variables. 

Similarly, all UNIX programs are expected to display unexpected error and 
warning messages to stderr and regular output to stdout, so that users can 
redirect them as desired.

Could you please supply an example?

1) There is nothing we can reproduce here (see the FAQ on BUGS), and

2) we don't take SAS as the gold standard, and

3) R does have glm.control() to control how convergence is determined, and
you do sometimes need to work with it.

There are models/datasets which do not have an MLE within the parameter 
set: for those R does converge to a value near the boundary.  But R
*should* converge then.  There are also situations in which R will 
converge (correctly) but simple IRLS will not.

in R and read the bottom of that page carefully,
and then send a report {with a reproducible example}?

scan() (and so also of course read.table, read.csv etc) crashes right
out of
R (GUI)
if it encounters non-ASCII characters (my particular example was a
superscript 2
which is OK in MS applications (even in Notepad this is OK: BMI*
(kg/m)).

For example

read.csv("d:\\table03.csv",colClasses="character")

generates

"This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down
..."

and the details says

RGUI caused an invalid page fault in
module R.DLL at 0167:004f3b67.

While it wouldn't be the first time there was a bug in glm, it's hard to
tell from your report whether the problem is with R, SAS, or your
expectations.

Can you give an example?

All,

I sincerely apologize for being so vague with my "bugs" query.  Part of this
is that it is not directly related to a specific data analysis, but rather
a part of a bigger project I am working on.  I also apologize if the bugs
forum is not appropriate for this problem.  Thank you Prof Brian Ripley for
your point to the glm.control() command, I will work with this for now and
it will solve my most immediate problems.

Specifically, I am running about 10,000 + permutations through an R program
on a bewoulf cluster of machines, and needed to get a handle on whether the
lines and columns of my report output file are consistant, so I can use this
in debugging the overall program for the parallel processing, as well as 
to keep track of any permutations for which a nonlinear program may not
converge.
In trying to answer the number of columns question I tried to find a problem
which I pretty much know has no reason to converge.  It is totally nonsensical
data (as you
can tell).  It does not converge in SAS or Splus for Windows, it does however
converge in R (version 1.6.1) for Windows and R (version 1.3.1) on linux -
though, of course the  stimates are obviously suspect.  I am enclosing simple R
commands 
for these silly data for your perusal.  Thank you for you time, and again, 
I am sorry for the premature post last night.

Well, others can speak for themselves, but R does for this data exactly 
what I would want a generalized linear model program to do. R finds the 
correct fitted values c(1,1,1,0.5,0,5) to 5 decimal places and the correct 
residual deviance -4*log(0.5) to 4 decimal places. The fitted values for 
the coefficients and theoreticaly infinite, but R does the best that can be 
done by giving large finite values and small t-statistics.

It is true that the fitted coefficients cannot converge for these data, 
because the stationary values are at infinity, but the fitted values and 
residual deviance can and do converge.

... and also OK in R (patched) for non-DOS-based Microsoft Operating 
Systems, like WinNT 4.0, hence difficult to debug
(unless Duncan has still a Win9x machine running?).

I agree with Gordon, and had already mentioned *exactly* this situation in 
my first reply.

If this example does not converge in SAS, do send a bug report to SAS.

However, none of this absolves users of GLMs knowing that they do not 
always have MLEs in the interior of the parameter space or that Wald tests 
can be arbitrarily unreliable or ....   That's why such things are covered 
in MASS4, for example.

OK, after having spent a few minutes I do not have:
The bug is obviously in as.matrix.data.frame() as the error message had
told me (I should have seen this yesterday at once). I cannot really 
suggest anything, since some of the constructs within 
as.matrix.data.frame() seem to be rather strange. For sure, at
least some of those are intended, but unfortunately the code lacks of
comments.

Dear David,
thanks for the report.

The "deeper" reason is

  > hsv(numeric(0),numeric(0),numeric(0))
  Error in hsv(h, s, v, gamma) : invalid argument length

which should return  character(0) instead --- and soon will.

Uwe,

You said you used

testdata <-
    data.frame(date = strptime(c("31121991", "31121991"), "%d%m%Y"),
               nothing = c(NA, NA))

but that's not the same object, and that one does work for me.

> dput(testdata)
structure(list(date = structure(c(694137600, 694137600), class = c("POSIXt",
"POSIXct")), nothing = c(NA, NA)), .Names = c("date", "nothing"
), row.names = c("1", "2"), class = "data.frame")

Has someone been doing something underhand like

testdata <- list(date = strptime(c("31121991", "31121991"), "%d%m%Y"),
          nothing = c(NA, NA))
class(testdata) <- "data.frame"
row.names(testdata) <- 1:2

?  That's the only way I can see to get this.  As it is not a valid data 
frame I think the error message is quite correct.  From ?data.frame

     A data frame is a list of variables of the same length with unique
     row names, given class `"data.frame"'.

and in this example `date' is of length 11.  Also

     If a list or data frame or matrix is passed to `data.frame' it is
     as if each column had been passed as a separate argument, with the
     exception of matrices of class `model.matrix'.

which is not the whole story as there is an as.data.frame.POSIXlt method
and that means that something underhand must have been done.
 
Another underhand approach would be 

testdata$date <- strptime(c("31121991", "31121991"), "%d%m%Y")

(or using [["date"]], but not ["date"]) : list operations on data frames
are not checked.


One could argue that write.table should follow print.data.frame and
call format first: which is why the invalid version of this example 
prints.

I hope that at this point we also implement

 ?f(x,y)

at this point, to give the same result (where x and y are existing
objects of classes "character" and "numeric", respectively).

help on calls was promised at DSC2003, but John wasn't in on that 
discussion.

This sounds like it might be related to the Windows FAQ 2.18, i.e. an
MSVCRT.DLL bug, though I think those were with the keyboard handler,
nothing to do with scan().  I'll be able to take a look next week on a
Win98 machine, but not in time for the 1.7.1 release, unfortunately.

Message-ID: <7D66E323-9D3E-11D7-931A-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>

I've been able to build a very primitive Aqua GUI for Darwin R.

This version as minimum event handler support but at least you can drag 
around the quartz device.

You need to download the RAqua.app.sit archive from 
http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/


You need to unstuff it and put inside your system Applications folder 
(i.e. /Applications)

If you click on the RAqua icon nothing will happen (in reality 
something happens if you have a look at the Console log window).

To run this version of R you should type the following from a term 
window


/Applications/RAqua.app/Contents/MacOS/RAqua


If you want to build this version of R you should download tomorrow 
R-devel tgz as I have just committed the files via CVS.
This version has been configured with

./configure --enable-R-shlib --with-blas='-framework vecLib' 
--with-lapack --with-aqua

if you have aquatcl/tk it should work fine. I'll try it tomorrow as it 
is too late now :)

I made a script RAqua with

#!/bin/sh
exec "/Applications/RAqua.app/Contents/MacOS/RAqua" "$@"

and put it in /usr/local/bin.

Now RAqua starts up the Aqua GUI, as expected, but library(tcltk)
says there is no tcl/tk support (and I do have the frameworks).

Also the menubar is blocked, and output from help() and library()
is written to the Terminal window.

But I guess you already new all this. Very exciting.

In previous builds I used, by the way,

configure  
--with-tcl-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh  
--enable-R-shlib --without-x --with-aqua --with-blas='-framework  
vecLib' --with-lapack TCLTK_LIBS='-framework Tcl -framework Tk'   
TCLTK_CPPFLAGS='-I/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.Framework/Headers  
-I/Library/Frameworks/Tk.Framework/Headers'

to make absolutely sure that AquaTcl/Tk was used.

yes, of course, I've not configured this version of R to use tcltk as I  
was too tired yesterday to reconfigure and rebuild. I'm doing it now  
but I'm sure it will work.

also I did not configure the R pager as "internal" so R prints out to

The aim of doing this is to was just to put some bases in R-devel where  
other Mac devels can experiment.
 From my side, I'm confident I can finish the GUI rather soon, but then  
there will be other delicate things to adjust.
The idea is to switch to Cocoa soon, which can be easily done inside  
Carbon.
The Quartz device will also be soon resizable.

Now that my teching time is over I have more time to work on it.

let's see.

At the url http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/

you can find the latest build of RAqua (which is a preview of what can 
be the Aqua GUI for Darwin R).

Unstuff the archive RAqua.app.sit, drag the RAqua icon into the 
Applications folder of your MacOS X System and double click on its icon 
to launch R. You can use quartz() device.

This version has been built to use AquaTclTk if properly installed.

For further instructions see the above page.

stefano

p.s. I'll not upgrade this version till a more functional gui and a 
finished quartz() device is available. You can try to build daily 
R-devel versions of RAqua on your own following the instruction on the 
cited web page.

Might it be an idea to make "?" a special operator akin to "+" or "[", R
users could then write their own help functions - may be even making "?"
generic? With the proposed xml help system one could imagine quite
sophisticated context sensitive help systems.

PS this has been a very useful debate for those of us enthusiastically using

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10306131053480.4040-100000@Erato.maths.lth.se>

Hello!

I'm trying to compile R-1.7.0 on a host of type alphaev6-dec-osf5.1.
gcc/g++ is version 2.9-gnupro-99r1.
./configure fails with the following last words:

checking for int... yes
checking size of int... 828617:./conftest: /sbin/loader: Error:
libncurses.so.4: symbol "LINES" unresolved
828617:./conftest: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: Load of "./conftest" failed:
Unresolved symbol name
configure: error: cannot compute sizeof (int), 77
See `config.log' for more details.

Is this a problem with the installed version of the compiler or with
the curses-library, both, or something else (if more configure output is
needed to determine this, I will gladly provide it)? Any ideas on what
it is that goes wrong and how to remedy this would be greatly appreciated.

I have seen in nmath directory that (dpqr)f is about F distribution.

The result obtained from these functions give the same result than
The F Fisher-Snedecor in cephes lib (from http://www.moshier.net/).

IIs it the same F (I think) and what's the difference between the two F.

Stefano, thank you for the Darwin-Aqua R-devel.

here are first observations:

1) the application must be named exactly as distributed. Usually I 
would ad a version number, but this leads to

/Applications/RAqua.app/R.bin.app/Contents/MacOS/R: 
/Applications/RAqua.app/R.bin.app/Contents/MacOS/R: No such file or 
directory

2) libdl.0.dylib must be installed, eg. from fink. Else you get
dyld: /Applications/RAqua.app/R.bin.app/Contents/MacOS/R.bin can't 
open library: /usr/lib/libdl.0.dylib  (No such file or directory, 
errno = 2)

3) it seems two processes are lauched, and both show up in the dock:
17562  ??  S      0:00.01 
/Applications/RAqua.app/Contents/MacOS/RAqua -psn_0_6291457 
HOME=/Users/gs SHELL=/bin/tcsh ....
17563  ??  S      0:09.72 
/Applications/RAqua.app/R.bin.app/Contents/MacOS/R.bin --gui-aqua 
PWD=/ R_HOME=/Applications/RAqua.app/R.bin.app/Contents 
R_SESSION_TMPDIR=/tmp/Rtmp17563 ....

4) The menus seem not to work any more.


I hope to try more over the weekend.

(First sorry for the late reply). Yes of course. My suggestion is that you
provide us with its (as a standalone package, or I would be happy to include it
in tseries), and we can all experiment a bit with both classes and maybe merge
them later on?

In fact, "?" already is an infix operator ("grep '?' src/main/gram.y" to
see the grammar part of it).  Quite a bit of work has been done towards
making more general use of "?".  See help("?") for the general ideas. 
Class documentation is available this way:
  class ? numeric
  class ? MethodDefinition

For Version 1.8, there will very likely be some extensions.  These
require a bit of change to the "?" function itself to allow more general
expressions as arguments.  With that in place the current consensus (I
think) is to support expressions of the form:
  method ? f("numeric", "numeric")
to access method documentation for "f" corresponding to signature
c("numeric", "numeric"); and also of the form
  ?f(e1, e2)
for method documentation for the method selected corresponding to
expressions e1 and e2.

Indeed.  There's been some nice work done.  One important question may
be finding the right balance between taking advantage of the nicer model
provided by XML and being compatible with current R documentation.

Yes, I think it's the first step in the right direction - we need a 
native OS X GUI ;). Good job, Stefano.

That should be easy to fix since there is a call to the framework to 
ask where the bundle root is.

A more general question about this: the libdl is really very tiny since 
all it does is it maps the usual "dfcn.h" API to Apple's API. Why not 
to add this statically to the R code? I'm not sure that this really 
needs to be external/dynamic code. Besides each version of the library 
differs (prepending underscores etc.) - so shouldn't we simply supply 
it with R in general (not just with the RAqua) like we do with pcre?

Obviously one is the GUI and the other the "regular" R (by using just 
one integrated bundle this problem should disappear). Funny enough one 
the the two Rs "jumps" in the dock up and down all the time until it's 
tired ;). A rather technical question: How do the two processes 
communicate?

4) The GUI should set the option to make "quartz" the default device 
(so far options(device="quartz") works quite well).

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <72ujevgnr0vt1hop4kbb1v9tfqd3e36a98@4ax.com>

In the little orientation data package I'm working on, the very first
example fails, even though the same code works when used in a regular
session.  In my experience, this usually indicates T or F has been
used instead of TRUE or FALSE, but that's not the case this time.

The error message is

 > x <- eulerzyx(1,0,0)
 Error: Trying to get slot "validity" from an object of a basic class
("NULL") with no slots
 Execution halted

What I think is the relevant source looks like this:

setClass('orientation')
setIs('orientation','vector')

setClass('eulerzyx', representation(x = 'matrix'))
setIs('eulerzyx', 'orientation')

eulerzyx <- function(psi, theta, phi) 
    new('eulerzyx', x = cbind(psi, theta, phi))

Can anyone tell me what that error message means?  Is it something
I've done wrong, or a problem with the methods package or the checks?

The code has a NULL object that was supposed to be a class definition
(and therefore to have a "validity" slot).

I was able to add your source & the one-line example to a small package
and get through R CMD check.

Can you do example(eulerzyx) after attaching the package?

Are you using a saved image (e.g., with an empty install.R file in the
package directory)?  (Though if not, the check would often fail at an
earlier stage.)

It would be nice to be able to get a dump from the R CMD check
evaluation--maybe someone can suggest how.

This is actually in the eulerzyx-class.Rd help file; I should have
said that.

I don't think so...

If you want to take a look, I've put the whole library (in its current
incomplete state) online at
<http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/temp/orientlib_1.0.tar.gz>,
and the log from running the examples here:

If I just cut all the preamble from the Rout file and paste it into
the console, I get the same error.  Here's a traceback(), I'm not sure
what you mean by a dump.

I think the problem is from not using a saved image.  Using your tar
file, if I untar into orientlib/, I get the same error you report.  But
after creating the install.R file:

guinan[RPackages]$ touch orientlib/install.R

the error in this example goes away.  (There is a later error:

> x <- rotvector(matrix(c(1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1)))
Error: ncol(m) == 9 is not TRUE

but I'm guessing this may be more local :-)

Hopefully for 1.8 we will get rid of the differences between saved image
and ordinary loading (except that the latter will still be slower for
packages doing much with classes and methods).

My name is James Hammond.
 
We've worked on previous and current projects. We've been working on a multitude of projects...paying our fees and building our downlines.
 
Have you noticed a big enough return for your efforts? Or, is it more of a scenario where you may see some profit, watch your downline unfold as they realise their downline isn't paying, and then be left paying a fee to another program and trying to rebuild everything.
 
It's happened to me and I'm sure it has happened to you. The only one's who really are making money  are the program owners, it seems.
 
There are a lot of good programs out there, with a lot of good program owners and administrators. It's just very difficult to keep your downlines together long enough to create some real residual wealth.
 
Until Now!!
 
A group of us, who have seen this happen too many times, have banded together to maximze the incredible compensation packages available on the Internet. 

What if  your matrix had no holes? What if the person at the  bottom of your downline had the resources to recruit and build their downlines?
 
We've decided to use the group resources available to us and promote a program as a team rather than compete with our referrals for new signups. Not only that, we are going to help their signups get more signups. 
 
We are going to build depth, to benefit our entire group!!!
 
Does this sound like something you'd be interested in ? If so, we are joining our first program as we speak. It is a program that allows us to build our team for free and then move to the more lucrative levels.
 
When you join, I'll add your name to our team rotator, and  we will start building your downline within 24 hours of signup.
 
Will you accept our invitation and let us help you build your downline?

Join free at:

Subject: [Rd] simple tools for extracting call graph information from Rprof
	output
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0306132120010.24736-100000@itasca2.stat.uiowa.edu>

A preliminary version of a package proftools for examining Rprof
profiling output and, in particular, extracting and viewing call graph
information is available at

    http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/codetools/proftools.tar.gz

Call graph information, including which direct calls where observed
and how much time was spent in these calls, can be very useful in
identifying performance bottlenecks.  The package produces either
printed representations of the call graph, analogous to the ones
produced by the GNU profiler gprof, or can be used to produce
graphical representations using the Graphviz command line tools or the
Rgraphviz package.

The README file in the package contains some documentation that will
eventually be worked into a vignette.

The implementation is extremely crude (a real mess would be more
accurate) and will hopefully be improved over time--at this point it
is more of an existence proof than a final product.

Performance is less than ideal, though using these tools it was
possible to identify some problem points and speed up computing the
profile data by a factor of two (in other words, it may be bad now but
it used to be worse).  More careful design of the data structures and
memoizing calculations that are now repeated is likely to improve
performance substantially.

It's a little tricky, and in any case the better solution is to ensure
that the semantics are the same with or without the saved image.

If it turns out that the time penalty for library(foo) with no saved
image is very large when foo contains class/method code, we could give a
warning at INSTALL time if a saved image is not created.  Or perhaps
make saved images the default?

I do not have /sw on my machine and I was able to build R till  
yesterday. So it should not be a problem related to fink.
But today I get the same error of you

No, but if you do not have dlcompat in /usr/local/lib, you also get
link errors because it cannot find dlopen and friends. So one need
a dlcompat somewhere where the linker can find it.

Not finding environ must be due to some very recent change in the
R code, it seems.

Yes--a bit of overzealous code cleaning by someone who thought code
conditionalized for __APPLE__ was for classic MacOS.  Should be OK
again in cvs.

Yes, __APPLE_CC__ is for Darwin indeed.

R-devel builds again from CVS if LDFLAGS is '-L/sw -lccc_dynamic'.
I can't build RAqua.app, though.

Hi,

the definition of `fsign' in R-exts currently is

double fsign (double x, double y) Function
  Performs "transfer of sign" and is defined as |x| * sign(x)

but should read

double fsign (double x, double y) Function
  Performs "transfer of sign" and is defined as |x| * sign(y)
                                                      ^^^^^^^

Pretty soon, hopefully, the RAqua version will make the Darwin/X11
version unnecessary. In the meantime, for convergence, I'll modify the  
Gifi
version in various ways.

-- It's 1.7.1
-- It no longer supports gnome
-- It still uses Tcl/Tk for X11 (using 8.5 from CVS)
!!  It no longer uses anything from fink (readline and dlcompat
     as on Stefano's site, jpeg and png and teTeX from Gerben Wierda's
     i-installer, Tcl/Tk from cvs, X11 from Apple)
-- the package installer will put everything in /usr/local

This means that all references to /sw in configure.ac can go. This
next distribution will appear probably on wednesday. Undoubtedly
some packages will break, because they still use stuff from /sw,
but I'll fix those as we go along.

Is the user expected to have separately installed any or all of these 
various libraries, or are they included in the R distribution and 
installed by the R installer? Or what?

Specifically for X11, does it assume the user has separately 
installed Apple's X11 and QuartzWM, and if so, is it in any way 
dependent on anything unique to Apple's X11? That is, will it work if 
the user is using XFree86/XDarwin and some (any) other window manager?

>-- the package installer will put everything in /usr/local

Do you mean that at some point in the future you intend that the 
configure.ac in the source distribution will remove all references to 
/sw? I'm not sure this is a good idea; I think I would prefer to have 
the option of building from sources using fink for those other things 
(readline, jpeg, png, tetex, etc) if I want to. Otherwise I have to 
learn how to get them from several other sites, increasing my system 
maintenance load and making it harder to keep them up to date.

Can you give specific and substantive reasons why fink should be avoided?

I get the impression that R for OS X is being moved away from being 
another unix R variant (in the sense that Solaris, various Linuxes, 
SGI, etc. are unix variants), and moved toward being a specialized 
platform-specific version. Assuming my impression is more or less 
correct, I'd like to understand the pros and cons of this move.

on this specific point: Darwin R will remain another unix-like build of 
R as it is now but with an additional GUI (the aqua module) and device 
(quartz). You can still build R-devel using fink.
RAqua is just a doubleclicking version of Darwin R.
Nothing will change for the developer I guess, but it will simplify the 
life to MacOS X end users.

I don't think there is the need to remove /sw from the search path at 
configure time.


The motivation of making an Aqua version of R is that I knew about 
several (lots of) people using OS X and Carbon R instead of Darwin/X11 
which is bad as Carbon R is becoming too limited (and for this reason 
no more supported starting with 1.8.0)

It seems to say the right thing.  1) 'orientation' is a virtual class;
2) it extends 'vector', with no implication about the contents of either
class and, since 'vector' is also virtual, no need to supply functions
to coerce one to the other.


> Do I need to say that?  Should I say that?

Yes to the second question.  To be honest, it probably doesn't make much
practical difference now, but it's the "right thing" to do, as I
understand your example.

The assertion is that for all 'orientation' objects, the vector
computations ( principally "[", "[[", and length) are meaningful & so 
'orientation' objects should inherit methods written for class "vector"
in terms of such computations.

In practice, there aren't many such methods, but there may be more
sometime.  Furthermore, there are many computations that are currently
not methods but that should conceptually be methods for "vector".  The
function rev, e.g.:

R> rev
function (x) 
if (length(x) > 0) x[length(x):1] else x
<environment: namespace:base>

This should really not be applied to non-vectors, and the definition is
in terms of vector computations.

A related point is that "[", etc. currently apply to objects for which
they are not conceptually meaningful.  Objects representing calls to
functions, for example.   (Both R and S-Plus allow it. R gets credit for
not allowing subsets of function objects, though, which S-Plus does
allow.)

R> ttt = quote(plot(x^2, y, pch ="+"))
R> ttt[2:3]
x^2(y)
R> rev(ttt)
"+"(y, x^2, plot)

!!


The behavior of [ is perhaps unlikely to be changed in base.  But if one
could optionally attach a more strict method-based package, I think it
would make sense to restrict "[" to classes that extend "vector" (which
includes, of course, the basic vector datatypes).

No, you don't need or want such a method.  In fact, it would be nice to
require that non-virtual classes extending 'orientation' DO have methods
for "[" (and, presumably, length()?  what about "[["?)

There is a simple technique considered for the Omegahat OOP package that
might be a useful addition in S4 methods as well.  We would introduce a
function, requireMethod, to force methods to be defined:

  requireMethod("[", "orientation")

The function is just like setMethod, except without a method definition,
and its effect is to generate an error for an object that dispatches
this combination of function and signature.  (Under the hood, it can
just call setMethod with a method that produces an appropriate error
message.)

The idea seems to convey what we want for virtual classes such as
'orientation'.  For example, by defining your method below for
"rotmatrix", you satisfy the requirement, and block dispatch of the
error method.

I think the move is to stop *assuming* fink, not to forbid it.

There are at least two goals

1. To produce a binary OS X distribution for people who don't want to
learn Unix, including an (optional) GUI and an (optional) quartz() device
driver.  If you want to stick with a command line and x11(), you're
welcome to. If you want to compile from sources yourself you can competely
ignore the binary distribution. This binary can't install
anything in /sw (because that would clobber fink) and doesn't want to
assume that anything is already there.


2. To produce a simple minimal set of instructions and dependencies for
compiling R on Mac OS X. A set of instructions that includes installing
fink is (I fervently hope) not minimal.  Of course, if you already have
fink installed you can easily use it to get all the necessary software.

You might in future have to specify a configure option to get configure to
look in /sw for system libraries, but this makes it more similar to other
Unices, not less similar.

Standard Apple stuff (such as anything in /usr, including X11) will
not be included in the installer package, but everything needed in  
/usr/local
will

I assume it will work with XFree86/XDarwin and with OroborosX, but
I am not going to test it with those, because I don't use them anymore.

I am sure that if more people want /sw, then it will just stay in. I am
just saying that as far as my distribution (and Stefano's) are concerned
it is not needed any more.

Of course you can always use it if you want to by setting LDFLAGS.

I try to avoid fink because it is a maze of nasty dependencies between
packages, which we do not need for R. It is also very inconvenient
and potentially disastrous to have duplicates of binaries and dynamic
libs in /sw and /usr/local and /usr. For instance, when Apple added
ncurses, many things went wrong. Fink is getting more and more
system-foo packages to deal with cases in which there are alternative
installs, and this will obviously become worse over time as more and
more gets added to Darwin. So (a) from the point of view of R
fink is overkill, and (b) fink has been great to have around for three
years but it is reaching the end of its usefulness period. Only my
opinion, of course.

Your impression that R is moved away from "just another Unix
variant" is correct only insofar as RAqua is being added as another
GUI. All the other GUIs (Terminal, Tcl/Tk, XTerm) remain available,
and for those savvy enough to build R fink and gnome can still be
used. There will just be no binaries.

The really native version doesn't really need to depend on X11 anymore 
since the use of X11 on Mac OS X was meant for applications that are 
not properly ported to OS X yet. Once Quartz and RAqua are complete 
there is no need for X11.

Jan already listed the main technical reasons why it is indeed a very 
good idea. Apart from that, fink is not an official package and was 
only meant as a temporary solution for people who need a (no matter how 
ugly) way to run existing unix programs on OS X. Hardly any real OS X 
user has installed fink (especially since Jaguar is out). Fink was 
great during the first couple of months when native OS X ports were 
hardly existent, but is now obsolete for mainstream OS X use.

It is not a "move" of R. Mac OS X is simply not "another unix variant". 
Darwin is indeed, but Mac OS X is not. You can compile X11 for Darwin 
and use it exactly the way you can use Linux on a PPC hardware. But Mac 
OS X has many very nice (often proprietary) layers that are important 
to the Mac users, but that part of OS X is not "unix". The goal here is 
to release R which fits in the philosophy of the system - ease of use, 
good integration with the existing frameworks, appealing design. These 
are not properties of unix, but of OS X. So what we need is in fact 
Mac-OS-X-like look and feel. The fact that OS X is unix-based helps 
with respect to the R engine itself - we need no special ports of 
packages anymore, but it has a totally different GUI.

Fortunately R makes a distinction between GUI and the engine, therefore 
we can create a real OS X GUI without affecting other platforms - 
including Darwin ;). "Unix" users are used to compile their own 
software, therefore moving fink support to the category 'optional' is 
only logical, since you can still easily enable it with configure 
parameters and/or environment settings. Real Mac OS X users are used to 
nice, binary distributions, therefore we cannot assume fink and we need 
Quartz device and RAqua. It will be a big help for most OS X users. 
(BTW: no Mac users I know (non-developers) have installed X11.)

Therefore the recent changes are IMHO really important from Mac OS X 
user's view - so far most binaries were rather experimental and assumed 
some unix knowledge (note: there was is no official OS X binary!). It 
was ok to use fink for those as a temporary solution, but the official 
binary cannot rely on unsupported non-Apple packages. The only thing 
external part we really need is libdl and I'm sure we can supply it 
simply with R - such as pcre etc., all other libraries are optional.

Simon

I completely agree with Simon, Jan, Thomas etc.
About libdl: in fact there is no need to link against it and I'll try 
to integrate it in the R sources.

I think completely agree with Simon here.  MacOSX is great for folks
that like the good things in life, but for chumps who just want a Unix
variant, run a PPC Unix (linux or *bsd or the like).  There are just
enough differences to create user-interface stress, depending on the
particular system configuration...

(of course, I'm one of those who has been using a unix variant for
almost 20 years now, and with the onset of senility, that isn't going
to change).

Do you have one of the environment variables TMP, TEMP, or R_USER
defined? (To find out, go into a DOS window and type "set", or "set |
more" if the list is too long to read all at once.) 

R tries to create a temporary subdirectory under the directory named
by those, in that order.  If the first one found gives the name of a
non-existent directory, you would see that error.

I appreciate the extra explanations from Simon, Jan, Thomas, and

things that I found potentially alarming in Jan's message yesterday 
are not so alarming anymore.

Except for one major flaw in Aqua--the absence of "focus follows 
mouse", as it is sometimes called in an X Windows context. I consider 
the absence a flaw because I find it incredibly useful to be able to 
type R commands into a window that is partially covered by another 
(usually graphics device) window. This is, of course, a (strongly 
held) personal preference, and I'm well aware that many do not 
consider this to be an issue. The Mac OS has always had this 
limitation, and probably always will, so there's nothing to be done 
about it.

More generally, having RAqua, a version of R that is as "Mac-like" as 
possible, is a good thing; I have co-workers who are more likely to 
use such a version of R. As someone who likes OS X a lot, I like 
anything that promotes it, and a good R gui will do that around here.

Jan cited "Gerben Wierda's i-installer" as a source for jpeg, png, 
and teTex. This source is somehow more "official" than fink? But, 
considering what Jan says, i.e. "everything needed in /usr/local 
will" be included with the installer package, it doesn't matter to 
the end user.

I'm glad to hear that, but when Jan says "all references to /sw in 
configure.ac can go" I do tend to wonder whether that is actually the 
case.

I subscribe to Apples "scitech" mailing list, for people interested 
in using the Mac in scientific applications. I'd say X windows is 
pretty common among those folks. Don't know how many of them would 
consider themselves "developers."

Hi Folks,

Fernando Tussell and I have been working on an R package of Shafer's
CAT software for S-plus, for multiple imputation of categorical data.

A very first version of this ("0.0-1") now seems to work, in that blatant
bugs and segfaults seem to have been worked around.

It now needs some testing in the wild, so if anyone would like to have
a copy of cat_0.0-1.tar.gz to try out (16062 bytes) please let me know
and I will send it.

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Yes, this is indeed a very nice feature (I've been using it on unix all 
time), but it can be disastrous at the same time. MS Windows has an 
undocumented registry key which allows you to enable this, but once you 
do that you'll realize that a lot of applications assume 
'topmost-has-focus' state and are almost unusable if the 
'focus-follows-mouse' is enabled (example: if you have a mouse over a 
toolbar your document window is inactive - most applications can't deal 
with that). I'm not sure about this in OS X (since we can't really test 
it ;P), but something similar might happen.

Exactly, that's the point :) We don't want to assume things that are 
non-standard. We should provide them if necessary.

There is still one issue to consider in this context: source packages. 
A really 'plain' Mac OS X can't be used to install source packages 
as-is, basically because there are three missing things: Dev Tools, g77 
and latex. The first one is official, so we could require that (and 
probably have to). G77 is really just a few files, so the installer 
could add it if necessary, but I'm not sure about latex. Is building 
packages w/o latex documentation an option? The direct use of source 
packages seems to me as the greatest benefit of OSX being unix-based, 
therefore i wouldn't like to miss it, even if I was pure Mac user...

Cheers,
Simon

We (R-core) have planned to make an automated procedure in order to 
provide prebuilt packages on CRAN for Darwin, so that 
install.packages() can eventually behave like on Windows (at least for 
RAqua).
Btw, I guess g77 will be included in the next release of DevTools.

It's a documented part of TweakUI, and I find it very usable.  After all, 
it I have my mouse over something on the toolbar, I have deliberately
moved focus there (just as in CDE), and it is very natural to someone
used to this from a good Unix windows manager.  Only a very few 
applications cause me problems (most notably the Visual Basic IDE).

It could be.  Checking them is not, though.

At DSC we seemed to decide that we would need a binary packages mechanism 
for the GUI MacOS X port.  I suspect you underestimate the difficulties 
(or overestimate the abilities of the users concerned): the Windows
experience is that is hard to overestimate the ability of the users to 
make stupid errors and not realize what.


As for this being `just another unix version': if only!  Simple things on
any other unix-alike like making a Rlapack dynamic library became major
headaches on darwin, only, and that is still not fully resolved.

For an OS X user with no unix background, I would think that pdf is 
the preferred format, and sufficient.

PDF is produced via latex in R.  Would that really be preferred to HTML?
Nothing in R is setup to produce PDF help, and especially not PDF 
hyperlinked between different documents (which is a problem in a dynamic 
framework).

BTW, could this sort of discussion go on in R-SIG-Mac or R-devel but not 
both since R-SIG-Mac is a closed list.

I think we have to distinguish what is distributed as binary and the 
building process of R.
If we distribute prebuilt packages for OSX we can provide both html and 
pdf files and leave out latex help.

I didn't know that. Does it require a full latex installation, or 
could one get by with just a subset, perhaps just pdflatex? It's 
probably a bad idea to complicate matters that way, though.

Speaking for myself, yes.

Speaking of which, this is another area where OS X is not like other 
versions of unix; the "native OS X" way to start a browser on the 
command line is with the "open" command, i.e., "open filename.html". 
OS X needs, for example,
     browseURL('somefile.html',browser='open')

pdflatex is just a symbolic link!  You do need a pretty full latex 
installation.

again you will be free to use browser="open" in browseURL but there are 
nice APIs to show HTML and PDF pages without the need external browsers.

To be more explicit: the RAqua I have built it is built to run under 
X11 as well, just execute it in an xterm window without specifying 
--gui-aqua. Nothing has changed!

Well, what happens if you say library(tcltk) and demo(tkdensity) in
the R running in Xterm ?

well, you already know the answer. This version of RAqua is built  
against AquaTclTk, so it won't work. But the x11() device will work  
fine. In this case two different versions of tcltk are competing X11  
and AquaTclTk.

But what I meant is that the X11 (itself) part works fine. One can  
still configure Darwin R to use X11/TclTk.

I need to stress the fact that we are talking about two different  
aspects: distributed binaries and building options.

1. If the user downloads and installs RAqua is not because he wants to  
use X11 stuff inside RAqua! He probably doesn't know what X11 standa  
for!
2. If you, me, Don etc, want to use all the X11 stuff, using fink  
instead of other sources of prebuilt dlls, this is still possible...and  
surely none of us will try to mix things (aqua/x11)

What I don't understand from this thread is: is Don asking binaries for  
darwin/x11 or just asking for the possibility of continuing building  
Darwin R on his own and configure R in his preferred way? I think he is  
asking for the second alternative: in this case, this is still  
possible. Just don't configure with --with-aqua (who oblige us?) and  
specify X11/TclTk headers at config time, run it in xterm. Moreover,  
RAqua is built using a script inside src/modules/aqua which is not part  
of the make R procedure. So if you execute it is because you do want  
Aqua and not X11.

We can consider the possibility of distribute two versions of binaries:  
"a' la" "RAqua" and "a' la" Jan :)

Subject: [Rd] A 'pretty' function for POSIXt objects
Message-ID: <p05210609bb150ade2c33@[128.115.153.6]>

I have written a set of functions for POSIXt objects that I would 
like to offer for consideration for use in base R. They augment and 
extend existing functions. Briefly,

##   pretty.ct         function(x,specs=pretty.ct.specs)
##   round.ct          function(x, tstr='1 min' )
##   axis.ct           function(side,x,specs=NULL,...)
##   parse.timeint     function(dv)
##   parse.tstr        function(tstr)
##   pretty.ct.specs   default value for the 'specs' argument of pretty.ct()

pretty.ct() is a 'pretty' function for POSIXt objects. It implements 
my idea of what is pretty, which is dependent on the time scale, and 
with the default specs prefers hours in multiples of 3, 6, or 12, and 
days in multiples of 7 or 14.

round.ct() serves the same purpose as round.POSIXt(), but allows 
rounding to multiples of the time unit, i.e., '15 min' , '2 hours', 
and the like.

axis.ct() serves the same purpose as axis.POSIXct() but selects tick 
values and intervals using pretty.ct(). Surprisingly, axis.ct() is 
significantly faster than axis.POSIXct() when passed a long vector.

The two parse functions translate strings like '10 min' or '36 h' to 
other more useable forms. These are based on code found in an early 
version of seq.POSIXct(), written, I believe, by Prof. Ripley.

A few examples are below.

If there is interest, I can send the source code, and will write Rd 
files for them.

It's not so much that I'm asking for a certain version; rather, I 
want to understand what direction things are going.

I do want to be able to build from source code and work in an X 
windows environment.

I do think having a binary distribution for the Aqua environment is a 
very valuable contribution. Even if I don't use it myself, I can use 
it to promote the use of R among my co-workers.

I'm not asking for binaries for darwin/x11.

When I build from source code, I don't mind reducing, or even 
eliminating, dependencies on fink, provided that the alternatives are 
not much more difficult to use. Despite the problems with fink that 
Jan describes, it is still an easy-to-use *single* source for all the 
additional libraries that R needs.

Does that help?

As always, I am very, very, happy that R is available for the Mac, 
and appreciate your work, and Jan's work, and that of everyone else 
who has contributed to bringing R to the Mac.

According to the documention, these should be the same:
  data.frame("a*"=3,check.names=F)
  data.frame(list("a*"=3),check.names=F)
but in the second case, it seems to think check.names=T.
I am using R 1.7.0 with Windows 98.

Yes, we know and it is planned to allow that.  However, R is a volunteer 
project and that looks far from trivial and rather low priority.  Now if 
you have a patch for that we would be pleased to see it.

Where is the bug? 

Please ask on R-help for help installing R, after reading the R-admin
manual to which the INSTALL file refers you.

You need to read tests/Examples/tcltk-Ex.Rout.fail to find out.
My guess is that your Tcl/Tk installation is not complete/compatible with 
your compilers/....  You could build without Tcl/Tk if you don't want it.

> Will R work if I tell it to use Sun's C, C++, and Fortran compilers?
> How do I tell it to do that?

Yes.  This is in the R-admin manual, which the INSTALL file asks you to
read. It discusses Tcl/Tk compatibility issues too, and how to build
without it.

It is not only non-trivial, but there is also a risk of running into
logical inconsistencies in some applications of model formulas. E.g.
in nls() and friends, the RHS is an arbitrary R expression and it
might involve true character strings -- think

y~lsoda(start, "Time since inj.", "myfun", parms=c(a=1,b=2),
        dllname="myfun.dll") 

where "Time since inj." could be a variable name, but the other two
are literals.

I'm rather tempted to suggest an extension to R's syntax involving a
"symbol quote" (the backtick, `like this`, would be available).
Haven't really thought it through though.

I see it too, using the Copy and Paste hotkeys in MDI mode.   I've
submitted it to r-bugs; I'll try to fix it sometime before the next
release (in October).

By the way, another workaround if you're allergic to the keyboard is
to use the right mouse button to bring up the local menu and choose
Paste from there; it also seems immune to the speedbutton (not hotkey,
as I miswrote in my previous message) bug.  That's the normal way I do
cut and paste, since the buttons aren't available in SDI mode.

Which cut and paste buttons / Hotkeys, please? The Menu? CTRL-C and 
friends? Which OS version?
Works for me either with Menu and shortcuts using a self-compiled 
version of R-1.7.1 on WinNT4.0.

Ahhh. Ignore my former message. Now I see.
(I have *never* used those buttons before, though.)

It's `over-zealous removal' of show(RConsole), in menucopy, menupaste,
menucopypaste.  (Also menukill.)

I'll commit a fix to R-patched shortly.

`Allegedly' as they say.  (There might be one earlier.)  In any case,
R-patched will continue to be available for people to compile up.

This looks like the explanation of PR#2798, which never mentioned using the
toolbar buttons and so was not reproducible.

Joaquin,

In case you don't already know, this problem that you and I had  in R-1.7.0
with tseries does not occur in R-1.7.1 .

BTW,  a real stupid question : is there a line command that can change the
file directory ( unix analogue would be "cd") in Rgui.exe ?  I change
directories using the item under the "File" menu right now, but that's a
real pain.

Thanks,

GB Zambre

Message-ID: <200306181638.h5IGcXJH019482@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Peter Gedeck
Version: R1.6.2 and R1.7.0
OS: Windows XP
Submission from: (NULL) (194.191.169.72)


Hello,

I marked the bug report Private, as I don't want my email address on the web
server. The problem that I found is best explained using an example.

index <- 1:6
cluster <- c(1,1,1,2,2,3)
tapply(index,cluster,sample)

gives 

$"1"
[1] 2 1 3
$"2"
[1] 4 5
$"3"
[1] 3 2 4 1 6 5

The result for 1 and 2 is correct, the last line should however be 
$"3"
[1] 6
and not return a sample containing all data. Other functions seem to work
correctly,

> tapply(index,cluster,min)
1 2 3 
1 4 6 
> tapply(index,cluster,max)
1 2 3 
3 5 6 
>  tapply(index,cluster,sum)
1 2 3 
6 9 6 

Another example which maybe gives an indication where the problem lies is 

> index <- 1:3
> cluster <- c(1,2,3)
> tapply(index,cluster,sample)
$"1"
[1] 1
$"2"
[1] 2 1
$"3"
[1] 1 3 2

The results should be 1, 2 and 3.

I tried to identify where the error occurs, but I think the error happens in
.Internal(lapply(X,FUN)) in lapply.

Regards,

Peter

That doesn't actually work. There used to be a checkbox for it but it
was removed a while ago. I see I forgot to remove the text that
explained how it worked (or didn't work: generally very few people got
to see those reports and that's why the feature got removed.) 

I'll fix the web page shortly.

You have already broadcast your address, and it is not reasonable to 
expect help anonymously.

In this case, the bug is in your reading of the help page for sample, 
quite possibly because you didn't read it.

Perhaps this might help your comprehension:

mysample <- function(x,...) {
    print(x)
    sample(x, ...)
}

> tapply(index,cluster,mysample)
[1] 1 2 3
[1] 4 5
[1] 6
$"1"
[1] 1 3 2

$"2"
[1] 5 4

$"3"
[1] 1 3 6 2 5 4

> sample(6)
[1] 5 2 3 4 1 6

Now look up what sample(6) does.

That is exactly what you asked for.  Working as documented is not a bug.

Maybe I() could be used to escape the true character strings?

Subject: [Rd] update.default bugfix (PR#3288)
Message-ID: <200306181714.h5IHEDJH019663@pubhealth.ku.dk>

According to the man page for formula, "a formula object has an associated
environment".  However, update.default doesn't use this environment, which
creates problems like the following:

  make.model <- function(x) { lm(medv~.,x) }
  library(MASS)
  data(Boston)
  fit = make.model(Boston)
  fit = update(fit,".~.-crim")
  # Object "x" not found

Here is a modification of update.default (from R 1.7.0) that fixes the
problem.

Tom

update.default <-
    function (object, formula., ..., evaluate = TRUE)
{
    call <- object$call
    if (is.null(call))
    stop("need an object with call component")
    extras <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$...
    if (!missing(formula.))
    call$formula <- update.formula(formula(object), formula.)
    if(length(extras) > 0) {
    existing <- !is.na(match(names(extras), names(call)))
    ## do these individually to allow NULL to remove entries.
    for (a in names(extras)[existing]) call[[a]] <- extras[[a]]
    if(any(!existing)) {
        call <- c(as.list(call), extras[!existing])
	    call <- as.call(call)
	    }
    }
    if(evaluate) {
      # minka: use environment of formula instead of parent.frame
      # see the man page for formula
      env<-environment(call$formula)
      if (is.null(env)) env<-parent.frame()
      eval(call,env)
    }
    else call
}

Are you *sure* this is a bug, and not just how you would like it to be
to help with a misconception?

I can't see anything (including ?formula) which says that the formula
environment should be used, and I can think of quite a few situations
which this would break.  The idea of update.default is that it should be
the same as evaluating the revised call in the calling frame, and your
version doesn't do that.

Yes, and I think that is correct.  This sort of thing is often done to 
fit against a different x.

Note that you are not even appealing to ?formula correctly. It says

     A formula object has an associated environment, and this
     environment (rather than the parent environment) is used by
     `model.frame' to evaluate variables that are not found in the
     supplied `data' argument.

and x is not such a variable (it is the `data' argument).

Now, had you done

make.form <- function(formula, data)
{
    env <- new.env()
    for(i in names(data)) assign(i, data[[i]], envir=env)
    environment(formula) <- env
    formula
}
form <- make.form(medv~age+black+crim, Boston)
fit <- lm(form)
update(fit, .~.-crim)

you *would* be making good use of the environment of the formula, and it 
does work.  I am pretty sure that is what ?formula is saying can be done.

I think this is a bug, but perhap someone could confirm that it is not just me doing something stupid. (I vaguely recall something like this previously getting fixed in 1.7.0.)

I can can confirm that it's a bug the 1.8 development branch, but not in 
1.7.0. (I don't have a 1.7.1 on this machine at present.)  The problem 
seems to be in the acf.R in the ts library.

1.7.1, 1.8.0 etc. have

<     if(is.matrix(x))
<         return(pacf(as.ts(x), lag.max=lag.max, plot=plot,
<                     na.action=na.action, ...))

while 1.7.0 has.

If I had to guess, I'd say that the call to the generic from a method is 
producing a loop.

It's not the same problem as was fixed for 1.7.0, which was 
namespace-related.  It's clearer if you do

z <- as.ts(matrix(rnorm(100), , 1))
class(z)
pacf(z)

The problem is that you have an n x 1 matrix as a time series. That _is_
somewhat silly, and avoiding that avoids the problem (and it does not 
occur in any of our test suites, unsurprisingly).

I think as.ts/ts ought to drop() such matrices.

The test

    if (is.matrix(x)) 
 
has always been wrong in that case: it should be 

    if (is.matrix(x) && ncol(x) > 1)

The problem has long been there, just the wrong method was called and
coped in the past.

I've put a fix in R-patched.

I am unable to replicate this under RH 9 using either the R 1.7.1 RPM or
from compiled source code after clean installs of both this morning.

You might want to ensure that you have a clean install of R.

I would first remove all copies of R on your system. Check to see what
RPMs are installed by using:

rpm -qa | grep R

to locate the installed R RPM. For 1.7.1 it should only list R-1.7.1-1.
So to remove it, as root, use:

rpm -e R-1.7.1-1


Then use:

whereis R

to locate any remaining R binaries and related files, which will
typically be in one or more of the following:

/usr/bin/R 
/usr/lib/R
/usr/local/lib/R
/usr/local/bin/R

Remove these files and directory trees if they exist.

Once you have completely removed any existing copies of R, then
reinstall the RPM using:

rpm -Uvh R-1.7.1-1.i386.rpm

and re-test.

You might also want to verify the MD5 signature on your downloaded copy
of the RPM with the value that Martyn has on CRAN just to be sure that
there is no corruption of the RPM.

HTH,

Also, I'm a bit confused as to how shift-Return should send anything
different that an ordinary Return to R. Which terminal emulator are we
talking about??

Update isn't going to satisfy everyone because people want it to do
incompatible things.  However, I don't think this is one of the things it
should be able to do.

In general the environment of a formula is used to look up variables in
the formula, not the data= argument.  (It's also used to look up the
weights= and subset= arguments, but that is a horrible wart that we would
like to excise).

Subject: [Rd] date and plot problems
Message-ID: <20030619184619.3F42D4443@sitemail.everyone.net>


Consider the vector of POSIXlt dates:

	t5 <- as.POSIXlt(paste("2003/01",1:5,sep="/")

which gives the result:

	"2003-01-01" "2003-01-02" "2003-01-03" "2003-01-04" "2003-01-05"

Upon using this with plot:

	plot(t5,1:5)   # ***

the points do not appear above the days.  There appears to be two 
problems with this:

1. the POSIXlt datetime class has no concept of timezone but when
its passed to plot it implicitly gets converted to POSIXct which
does.  When that happens, it appears that GMT is used as the 
timezone rather than the current timezone so the dates are not
what you think they are.

2. the end of day is plotted above the x axis label rather
than the beginning of day.

The following workaround fixes both of these:

        plot(as.POSIXct(t5,tz="GMT")+24*60*60-1,1:5) 

The problems cited above are pretty subtle and deserve at least a 
mention and probably some changes.  Potential solutions include:

- adding a plot.POSIXlt method (to avoid unnecessarily introducing 
  time zones)

- adding date classes and methods (not just datetime classes and 
  methods) so plot can know how to proceed

- adding smarts to plot

- or perhaps these problems can be subsumed under generalizations
  to regular and irregular time series in some way

One other item.  The x axes labels for

        plot( t5[1:4], 1:4 )

need improvement.

(I am using R 1.7.1 on Windows 2000 Pro.)

I'm having trouble using lattice and Sweave together.

An example of the trouble is the chunk

<<fig=true, eps=false>>=
library(nlme)
data(Orthodont)
plot(Orthodont)
@

This gives a warning

Warning message:
No Active Device, using default values in: trellis.par.get("add.text")

 and creates a pdf file with no pages.

I think this is related to the fact that a figure chunk is evaluated
twice, once with no device open.  Possibly related anomalies include the
fact that you end up with a theme set for the null device:
> names(lattice.theme)
[1] "null device" "postscript"  "pdf"
which doesn't look right.

The chunk
<<>>=
library(lattice)

 data(airquality)
 windspeed<-equal.count(airquality$Wind, 4)
 temperature<-equal.count(airquality$Temp, 4)

 print(xyplot(Ozone~Solar.R|windspeed*temperature, data=airquality,
col="darkred"))
@

works fine, so I think the problem is related to using trellis.par.get
before setting a trellis device.

I have a big sign next to my monitor saying 

 When using Sweave you _must_ print a lattice plot.

because I have made this mistake so many times.  In my rush to finish
the slides for a short course that I am teaching today and tomorrow I
forgot this and contacted Deepayan, who is travelling in India right
now, in a panic. He calmly told me "you forgot to print".

It will work if you use

 print(plot(Orthodont))

D'oh.  Of course.  And the reason the other lattice plots worked is that I
did print them, because they weren't called as methods for plot().

Please don't!  Functions that return qualitatively different values (e.g., 
different classes or number of dimensions) depending on input data values 
or lengths of dimensions lead to nasty surprises in automated analyses and 
simulations.  This sort of thing might be nice for interactive use, but it 
makes robust programming difficult.

This seems to be deliberate, since paste.c says

	return mkString("");

but it is not documented and it is not what S (even S+3.4) does.

On the other hand, S gives

[1] " "

which looks incorrect to me (and R gives "" which I reckon to be right).

Anyone know the rhyme or reason here?

..Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
..
..There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
..To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
..Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
..cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
..internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
..This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
..mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
..(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
..and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

The best place for questions is probably the r-help list, or possibly
the r-devel list.  See <http://www.r-project.org/mail.html> for the
descriptions, archives, etc. 

Please *don't* send help requests to the r-bugs list; that wastes time
for the developers, because every message there ends up in the bug
repository at <http://bugs.r-project.org/>.

So you are running either /rw1070/bin/Rcmd (is it in your path?) or you 
have set the environment variable RHOME inappropriately, I guess.

This is NOT a bug! Please don't send bug reports when you are not sure 
about it.
For questions there is R-help, and for developer issues the R-devel 
mailing list (after having read the docs).

Hi.  I wanted to add two new columns to a data frame, and ended up

 > temp <- data.frame(a=1:3, b=4:6)
 > temp[[c("d","e")]] <- NA

Process R trace trap at Mon Jun 23 16:32:36 2003

I know the above code isn't very elegent, but it shouldn't crash R.

I managed to add the new columns doing

Subject: [Rd] optim with constraints (PR#3325)
Message-ID: <200306231552.h5NFqwJH026941@pubhealth.ku.dk>



The source code listed below (just before the system information) makes 
"optim" to ignore the bounds on one of the parameters; this is detected 
by the function to be optimized (sn.dev) and the program stops.  On my
computer the numeric optput which I obtain is:

sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3222  0.3738  0.3263 42.1824
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1]  2.092  4.059 -4.039
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1]  -2.2611   0.2060   0.6266 686.3262
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -1208.1 -5719.7  -287.1
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3632  0.3665  0.3394 42.6260
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -27.758   1.067  -4.431
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3279  0.3728  0.3281 42.1705
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -1.976  3.989 -4.090
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3279  0.3667  0.3348 42.1461
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -0.4494 -4.9931 -4.0685
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3280  0.3671  0.3403 42.1219
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -0.5089 -4.4250 -4.0727
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3282  0.3686  0.3623 42.0268
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -0.7684 -2.2082 -4.0932
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3290  0.3748  0.4506 41.6734
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1] -2.128  5.823 -4.226
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1]    -1.3341     0.3927     0.9953 25934.9488
sn.dev.gh: gradient=[1]    219013   -312643 441647332
[1] -1.3546  0.4645  3.1741
Error in fn(par, ...) : cp outside bounds

The code looks somewhat involved.. however, what it does is to set up 
ingredients to run the final statement:

opt<- optim(cp, fn=sn.dev, gr=sn.dev.gh, method="L-BFGS-B",
         lower=c(-rep(Inf,m),1e-10, -0.99527), 
	 upper=c(rep(Inf,m), Inf, 0.99527), 
	 control=list(iter.max=100, abs.tol=1e-5),
	 X=X, y=y, trace=TRUE, hessian=FALSE)

The above sequence stoped because the last component of vector cp
is  3.1741, which exceeds the bound 0.99527.

Notice that the problem occurs "with 0 probability", in the sense 
that
1. if you change some of the data below (in vector monica2), then it is
   most likely to run fine;
2. if you change the starting point, then again it  works;
   specifically I changed
     cp <- c(qr.coef(qrX,y), s, gamma1)
   to 
     cp <- c(-1.322168500,  0.373810085,  0.326283975)
   which differ by [1]  2.666e-10 -3.154e-10 -3.033e-10
   and it worked from the second starting vector;
sn.dev: (cp,dev)=[1] -1.3222  0.3738  0.3263 42.1824

It's erroneous code, and the current development version of R correctly
reports so.

or temp[c("d","e")] <- NA.

Are you sure you know the difference between [] and [[]]?

Why is this a bug?  If you take apply floor to a number that you expect to
be exactly 3, but compute it on a binary computer via logs to base e, you
must expect some rounding error.

BTW, on my Windows XP machine I do get

> floor(log10(1000))
[1] 3

There is no bug in R, but your usage of it is potentially dangerous.

You might want to ensure your R is up-to-date: version 1.7.1 is current.

I have put on http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/ a new version of RAqua 
which has a better GUI and responds to drag and drop, copy and paste 
etc (for more info see the above page).

Most of the menus are not working at the moment but any feedback is 
welcome to design a good GUI for Darwin R.

p.s. as usual  use this R-devel version of R  for beta testing only

Subject: [Rd] Putting an object in a data farme
Message-ID: <1gggfv0aa63o8eqtobj15qt9384gppfpcn@4ax.com>


I'd like to use the modelling functions, in particular  model.frame,
with the S4 orientation objects I'm writing.  However, these use
data.frames, and data.frames object to having my objects put in them.
model.frame checks the mode of the object before it puts it in;
data.frame seems to be trying to coerce my class to data.frame, and
it's failing.

What's necessary to put a nonstandard object into a data.frame?

Subject: [Rd] S4 method setClass prototype definition question
Message-ID: <news2mail-3EF86BE1.4080508@epigenomics.com>


Dear list,

this is not a problem report -- I would like to ask for advise what the 
recommended and safe way to perform the following is or what problems might 
arise in doing it differently.

The question is:  What is the recommended way of providing a default value in a 
prototype statement for a derived class for a slot provided from a parent class?
I have first consulted the methods package reference but am still unclear to as 
this point.


The following is a bit length example + variations thereof taken from a real 
project.

I would appreciate any comments and insights shared.

Best regards,

   Matthias

That's probably not a good idea: I gave up for S-PLUS with S4 classes a 
long time back.  Too many utilities assumed that a classed object was a 
list with components like call and formula.

You need either to enclose it in I() or write an as.data.frame method for 
it, which may be difficult if it does not have an S3 class.

Different DLLs, no doubt.  Possibly also different chips.

The real question is why *you* expected them to be the same?

I can guess two possibilities:  

1.  One of you is using the binary I compiled, the other is using
something different.  Since mine shows 2 as the answer, I think Kjetil
might be using mine.

2.  One of you has had the floating point precision reduced by some
buggy DLL or video driver.  

There are probably other explanations. The calculation is inherently
unstable; it might be that Brian did it under a different phase of the
moon, and that's why he got the "right" answer.

Subject: [Rd] joining columns as in a relational database
Message-ID: <6risqvyt0a.fsf@bates4.stat.wisc.edu>

In our recent workshop on "Multilevel Modeling in R" we discussed
handling data for multilevel modeling.  An classic example of such
data are test scores of students grouped into schools.  We may wish to
model the scores as functions of both student-level covariates and
school-level covariates.

Such data are often organized in a multi-table format with a separate table
for each level of information.  The MathAchieve and MathAchSchool data
frames in the nlme package are examples of such an organization.  The
HLM software requires the data to be organized like this.  To fit a
model in R we need to create a composite table by "joining" the
columns of the student-level and school-level tables, in the
relational database sense of "join".

I have created a function to join the columns from two such frames
according to the values of a key column.  In relational database terms
the key column must be a primary key for the second frame.  I have
called this function 'cjoin', by analogy to cbind.

You can try

data(MathAchieve, package = 'nlme')
data(MathAchSchool, package = 'nlme')
cjoin(MathAchieve, MathAchSchool, "School")
cjoin(MathAchieve, MathAchSchool, "School", which = "Sector")

as examples

Several questions:

 - Am I duplicating existing functionality?

 - Is cjoin a good name for such a function?

 - Would this be useful in base?

-------------- next part --------------
"cjoin" <-
    function(fr1, fr2, cnm1, cnm2 = cnm1, which)
{
    val = as.data.frame(fr1)
    vnms = names(val)
    cnm1 = as.character(cnm1)
    if (length(cnm1) < 1 || any(is.na(match(cnm1, vnms)))) {
        stop("cnm1 must be one or more column names from fr1")
    }
    fr2nm = names(fr2)
    if (!missing(cnm2)) {
        cnm2 = as.character(cnm2)
        if (length(cnm2) != length(cnm1) || any(is.na(match(cnm2, fr2nm)))) {
            stop(paste("cnm2 must be", length(cnm1),
                       "column name(s) from fr2"))
        }
    } else {
        if (any(missed <- is.na(match(cnm2, fr2nm)))) {
            stop(paste("No columns named", paste(cnm2[missed], sep = ", "),
                       "in fr2"))
        }
    }
    if (length(cnm1) == 1) {

                          "of fr2 cannot be matched"))
            mcol = mcol[is.na(mcol)]
        }
        if (length(mcol) != length(unique(mcol))) {
            stop(paste("column", mcol, "must be a unique key to fr2"))
        }
        mm = match(fr1[[cnm1]], fr2[[cnm2]])

        }
        if (missing(which)) {
            which = fr2nm[!(fr2nm %in% cnm2)]
        } else {
            which = which[!(which %in% cnm2)]
            if (any(missed <- is.na(match(which, fr2nm)))) {
                stop(paste("No columns named", paste(which[missed], sep = ", "),

Prof. Bates,

Perhaps I am not seeing all of the details but a quick (perhaps too
quick) review would suggest that merge(), which is in base, would at
least be a parallel function.

For example:

data(MathAchieve, package = 'nlme')
data(MathAchSchool, package = 'nlme')

cj1 <- cjoin(MathAchieve, MathAchSchool, "School")
mrg1 <- merge(MathAchieve, MathAchSchool, by = "School")

dim(cj1)
[1] 7185   12

dim(mrg1)
[1] 7185   12

colnames(cj1)
 [1] "School"   "Minority" "Sex"      "SES"      "MathAch"  "MEANSES"
 [7] "Size"     "Sector"   "PRACAD"   "DISCLIM"  "HIMINTY"  "MEANSES"

colnames(mrg1)
 [1] "School"    "Minority"  "Sex"       "SES"       "MathAch"  
"MEANSES.x"
 [7] "Size"      "Sector"    "PRACAD"    "DISCLIM"   "HIMINTY"  
"MEANSES.y"


> table(cj1 == mrg1)
 
 TRUE
86220


Note that cj1 appears to have duplicate colnames for "MEANSES", for
which your function does issue a warning message, whereas mrg1 has
appended ".x" and ".y" as default suffixes.


In the second case, if I am reading the code correctly, the 'which'
argument appears to restrict the columns retained from the second data
frame after the key match, in this case "Sector".

> cj2 <- cjoin(MathAchieve, MathAchSchool, "School", which = "Sector")
> mrg2 <- mrg1[, c(1:6, 8)]

> dim(cj2)
[1] 7185    7

> dim(mrg2)
[1] 7185    7

> colnames(cj2)
[1] "School"         "Minority"       "Sex"            "SES"
[5] "MathAch"        "MEANSES"        "fr2[mm, which]"

> colnames(mrg2)

There appears to be a bug in loess.  It fails when you specify
"method".  For example:

data(cars)
cars.lo <- loess(dist ~ speed, cars)
# works, and should be the same as:
cars.lo <- loess(dist ~ speed, cars, method="loess")
# but this fails with:
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras,
extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

Included is a possible fix (only one line is added).

No, you are seeing better than I.  I had not thought to look up merge
- I only thought of join.  I can use merge.  The answer to my first
question is that I am duplicating functionality.

It was an interesting exercise.  Thanks for pointing out merge.

Glad to be of help.

What is interesting is that merge() does not show up if one uses
help.search("join"). The function description is:

"Merge two data frames by common columns or row names, or do other
versions of database ``join'' operations."

It would seem to be worthwhile to add 'join' as a \keyword and \alias
for merge(). 

Also, since cbind() is listed in the merge() "See Also" list, it would
seem logical to add merge() to "See Also" for cbind().

Both adjustments would probably make it easier to find merge() and save
time.

Regards,

Marc

?merge says

     Merge two data frames by common columns or row names, or do other
     versions of database ``join'' operations.

and it has done all the examples of this sort of thing that I have ever 
needed.

Message-ID: <200306270000.h5R00NJH002321@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Dear r-bugs,

I'm having problems loading the 'grid' package when it has been detached
earlier in the same session:

> library(grid)
> detach("package:grid")
> library(grid)
Error in .Call("L_initGrid", PACKAGE = "grid") :
        .Call function name not in load table
Error in library(grid) : .First.lib failed

This bug was mentioned on r-help some time ago
(www.stat.math.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2002-January/016904.html), but I
don't think it has entered the bug tracking system yet. The bug is
relevant for me since it crashes functions I use for package maintenance.

[That has nothing to do with this: it was a broken Windows build of R
1.4.0 on CRAN, and that message says that it was fixed in the next build.]


Basically, what you are doing is not supported.  Don't detach packages you 
want to re-use.  With the sort of amount of memory people have these days, 
it makes little sense ever to detach packages. (It does not unload the DLL 
in general, and grid is a rare exception.)

The specific issue is that grid contains a .Last.lib which does unload the 
DLL but does not unregister it. It needs to be

.Last.lib <-function(libpath) {
  if (.grid.loaded) {
    # Kill all existing devices to avoid replay
    # of display list which tries to run grid code
    # Not very friendly to other registered graphics systems
    # but its safety first for now
    graphics.off()
    .Call("L_killGrid", PACKAGE="grid")
    dyn.unload(paste(libpath, "libs",
                     paste("grid", .Platform$dynlib.ext, sep=""),
                     sep=.Platform$file.sep))
   .dynLibs(.Dyn.libs[-match("grid", .dynLibs()])
  }
}

and note the comment there.  (Paul: please use file.path is the dyn.unload 
call.)

Subject: [Rd] Subsetting and conversion in data frames
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0306271130410.8254-100000@gannet.stats>

I have now finished a long session of documenting and bug-fixing the way 
subscripting of data frames works -- you can see this in the NEWS file in 
R-devel.

As far as I know we are at the point where the only times that character
columns get converted to factors are in data.frame(), read.table() and
when as.data.frame() is called on a list.  (There are read.table-alikes in
other packages which will also convert.)  So if you have a character
column in a data frame, it should stay that way.

cbind.data.frame calls data.frame and so converts, and I believe it should
not.  There may be others (anyone know of any?).

This raises the possibility that using data.frame(I(foo)) could make foo a 
character column and not give it class "AsIs".   I've heard comments that 
having the additional class slows code down, but not seen any examples.
Any relevant experience or comments?

Subject: [Rd] Update on "Shift-Return causes segfault (PR#3293)"
Message-ID: <200306271611.h5RGB4JH010679@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi all,

I don't read this list, so if anyone wants to respond could they please copy 
me so that I see what is happening.

After several exchanges between myself, Marc Schwartz and Peter Dalgaard, we 
have come to the following conclusions:

a) Shift-Return does not cause a segfault on most terminals, only Kde's 
Konsole.

b) The bug is easily reproducable there.

c) The "real" bug is that the control sequence Meta-Shift-O followed by any 
character causes a segfault on every terminal type we have access to.

d) For some reason, Kde's Konsole interprets Shift-Return as "Meta-Shift-O 
Shift-M", which is the source of the original bug report.

e) The most helpful error message we can generate is:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x400dd7fe in _rl_dispatch_subseq ()
   from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/../../../libreadline.so.4

implying that there is some strange interaction going on with readline, and 
that the bug may be in readline rather than R.

f) The bug does not seem to be present in R-1.6.2, though this is only my 
experience, not anyone elses.  Peter Dalgaard HAS reproduced the bug in 
R-1.7.0.

I hope this is all clear.  If there is anything that is not, please get back 
to me and I will attempt to clarify what I meant!

Graeme.

..and I just now found a SuSE machine still running 1.6.0 which is
also immune to the problem.

What version of readline is linked to R 1.6.0 on that system?

The function _rl_dispatch_subseq is apparently new in readline 4.3.

When I link my copy of R (1.7.0-2.cran.3 from the Debian package) with
a copy of libreadline-4.3 (built from source obtained from
ftp.gnu.org) and enter M-Shift-O at the prompt, it goes into an
infinite loop:

(letting it run for a second or so generates thousands of these calls).

Making the following change in readline.c seems to avoid the infinite
loop, but I don't know whether it is the correct fix.

Probably version 4.1 --- I remember in the past always having to install the 
readline41-4.1-xx package to get R to work.  Perhaps Martyn should go back to 
linking against that in the short term until the bug in readline can be 
squashed?  Or does R-1.7.x need some additional functionality provided by 
readline-4.3?

It isn't.  :-/  There are 5 patches on ftp.gnu.org in the
/pub/gnu/readline/readline-4.3-patches.  The first one covers this 
problem:

Bug-Description:

Pressing certain key sequences causes an infinite loop in _rl_dispatch_subseq
with the `key' argument set to 256.  This eventually causes bash to exceed
the stack size limit and crash with a segmentation violation.

Probably not, but it would be a pain to get RH8 users to install the
readline41 stuff (does it exist in RPM form on that platform)?

However, it should work to add the line

        "\M-OM":accept-line

to your ~/.inputrc file. That should make the KDE shift-Return
sequence work like an ordinary Return.

I've just rebuilt an rpm from the RedHat SRPM and the patches from ftp.gnu.org 
and R no longer crashes in any of the cases I have previously described.  I 
can let anyone who wants have a copy of the modified rpms for both RH8 and 
RH9.  The patch numbers are incremented one from the originals, so they 
should update cleanly on any system.

I guess you can probably close this bug now.  It's a bit annoying that RH 
didn't apply the patches themselves for RH9, since the relevant one came out 
about 6 months before RH9 was released!

Has anyone filed a bug report with RedHat on this?

I just did.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=98229


As Graeme has stated, the patches are available and this and other
readline related bugs have been reported previously to RH's Bugzilla and
were closed, based upon my search this morning. I am unclear as to why
this seems to be happening yet again, other than RH neglected to include
the patches in the last update.

In checking RH's dates for the readline RPM updates, version 4.3-5 was
made available back in January, so this particular bug's patch and one
other were available prior to that, however the three other patches that
are listed are after that date. The five patches are listed at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-4.3-patches.

So it would seem that RH is long overdue in issuing an updated readline
RPM.

Marc Schwartz

Message-ID: <200306281939.h5SJdBJH015415@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Matthew Ingram
Version: 1.7.0
OS: Windows XP
Submission from: (NULL) (68.97.54.81)


When I double click on R, it starts up and then displayes an error message in a
pop-up window which says "R for Windows GUI front-end has encountered a problem
and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience."

The error report has some of the following information:

Error Signature:  AppName: rgui.exe	 AppVer: 1.70.30416.0	 ModName: r.dll
ModVer: 1.70.30416.0	 Offset: 000312f0

Technical Information:

Exception Information:
Code: 0xc0000005

The rest of the information seems to be version related and memory related.  I
am not sure what else is important.  However, I have used R before and I really
want to continue to use this program in my research.

Please let me know if you have any more questions or need more information.

Thanks!

There is nothing here to help reproduce the problem, but experience says 
it is not R but other software on your machine that has the bug (for 
example, a graphics driver or utility), so we would be unable to reproduce 
it.

Note that the current version is R 1.7.1.

We suggest that you reinstall Windows and then install rw1071.exe onto a 
clean installation of Windows.
