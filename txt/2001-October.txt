help(lm)

says that

  An object of class `"lm"' is a list containing at least the
     following components:

  ...

  formula: the formula supplied.


But is the "formula" component necessarily present?

An example:
> x<-rnorm(10)
> y<-rnorm(10)
> temp<-lm(y~x)
> names(temp)
 [1] "coefficients"  "residuals"     "effects"       "rank"

 [9] "xlevels"       "call"          "terms"         "model"
> temp$formula
NULL

Nicely spotted. Yes, it's present:

> formula(temp)
y ~ x

However, it is part of the terms (and model) component, not a
component in itself (str(temp) to see it) so should probably not be
documented as such.

Message-ID: <200110011343.PAA16182@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi everyone,
  I have just tried to compile R 1.3.1 on the following platform:

R is now configured for mips-sgi-irix6.5

  Source directory:          .
  Installation directory:    /usr/local
  C compiler:                gcc  -g -O2
  C++ compiler:              g++  -g -O2
  FORTRAN compiler:          g77  -g -O2

  X11 support:               yes
  Gnome support:             no
  Tcl/Tk support:            no

  R profiling support:       yes
  R as a shared library:     no

and came up with the following error:

making Lapack.d from Lapack.c
        gcc -I. -I../../../src/include -I../../../src/include -I/usr/local/include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -fPIC  -g -O2 -c Lapack.c -o Lapack.lo

        g77  -fPIC  -g -O2 -c cmplx.f -o cmplx.lo
don't know how to make # (bu42).
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

What is "bu42" and or error code "bu21"? And how do I get R to compile?
Thanks,
Patrick.

Subject: [Rd] problem with strptime example (PR#811)
Message-ID: <200110011358.PAA16380@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hello,

strptime is still not working correctly in my computer 
(Windows 98 and R Version 1.3.1)  

From

x <- c("1jan1960", "2jan1960", "31mar1960", "30jul1960")
strptime(x, "%d%b%Y")

I obtain

[1] "NA" "NA" "NA" "NA"

while 
x <- c("01011960", "02011960", "3131960", "3071960")
strptime(x, "%d%m%Y")

gives 
[1] "1960-01-01" "1960-01-02" "1960-03-31" "1960-07-30"

So it seems that the problem is with %b.

Highly system-dependent codes, I'd guess. Are you using GNU make?

This is working as documented, i.e. correctly.

Do read all the example, which contains an explanation and workaround
(which does not work on all systems and hence is in the comments).

In your locale `jan' is not the abbreviation for January, I believe.

This works fine for me on a similar setup. Does Finnish localisation
do strange things with month names??

Be careful!  Both gnudoit and gnuclient could be used, depending on

well, the current code has a hard-coded "gnudoit", so what Thomas
reported was clearly a docu bug, which I fixed. If we want to support
gnuclient in addition to gnudoit that would be a new feature ... when
is which used?

Subject: [Rd] calling browser in Windows
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110021342140.30794-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  I'm working on the interface to LiveGraphics3D (Java applet for dynamic
3D graphics) that I mentioned earlier on the list, and I've hit a
cross-platform problem.
  I want to allow the option of popping up a browser or opening the file
in a browser automatically.  On Unix, the following (stolen from
help.start()) works:

system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null || ",
               browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))

If I want to do this in Windows, options("browser") is NULL.  (For now I'm
hardcoding browser to "C:/PROGRA~1/INTERN~1/IEXPLORE.EXE", but this
clearly isn't a general solution.) The syntax of the call is also
different (IE at least appears to require just the file name, "file:/"
just seems to confuse it).  I don't know how to start a browser in the
background, or do the equivalent of -remote ...  help.start() is
considerably more internalized on Windows, so I'm not getting much useful
there.

  Here's what I'm doing now:

  mach <- machine()
  if (mach=="Unix") {
    url <- paste("file:",file.path(getwd(),fn),sep="")
    system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null ||
",
                 browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))
  }
  else if (mach=="Windows") {
    system(paste(browser,file.path(getwd(),fn)))
  }
}


  Is there a different idiom I should be using for Windows?
  I suppose it's all completely different for the Mac too ...
  Might it be possible to standardize this interface?

 thanks,
  Ben Bolker

After some investigations:
In plotmath.c, line 2250 the "the gap between the nucleus and the
radical extension" is defined:
 #define RADICAL_GAP    0.4

It looks like this gap is not added to the hight (or included in the
calculations of the hight) of the denominator of a fraction. So the
whole denominator is located to close to the fraction bar, if a root is
drawn.
I don't see, how this can be fixed smartly ...

Subject: [Rd] tiny typo in optim/N-M documentation (PR#1109)
Message-ID: <200110031509.RAA09208@pubhealth.ku.dk>


In the optim() documentation,  the control parameter "maxit" says
"There is no other stopping criteria."  That should be "are", or
"criterion" ...

While I'm at it -- poking at the code a little bit, it looks as if the
initial simplex is set from the initial point by displacing each
parameter value by max(0.1,0.1*pmax(fabs(Bvec))), where Bvec is the
initial parameter set.  It would be nice to have a bit more external
control of this procedure.
  Is anyone interested in hacking this?  If I did it myself would
anyone be interested in the results?  Or does fussing with the
Nelder-Mead simplex seem silly because anyone who is really serious
about optimization will being using another method anyway?

Subject: [Rd] Several R vs S-Plus issues (PR#1110)
Message-ID: <200110031539.RAA09399@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi, all,

   I've been converting code from S-Plus ("S" for short) to R for a few weeks.
Here are some differences I've found, aside from the big well-known ones
(scoping, models, data storage) and the contents of Kurt Hornik's FAQ section
3.3.3.  Let me start with the ones that seem like serious bugs or deficiencies:

1) LETTERS[c(NA,2)] in S is c("","B"), but in R is c("NA","B").

  This is TERRIBLE!  I have a ton of S-Plus code that looks like:
     y$ticker <- z$ticker[match(y$cusip, z$cusip)]
  and I count on a ticker of "" to indicate failed lookups.  Not only will
  I need to change all that code, but I'll never be able to trade Nabisco
  (ticker NA) again.  PLEASE re-consider this choice, or at least make it
  an option: option(na.char="").


2) system() has no "input" argument in R.

   Here's a (Unix) example:
   S> system("cd mydir; latex myfile", input="x")
     which goes to the directory where myfile lives and LaTeX's it, passing
     an "x" through STDIN in case LaTeX encounters an error.  My R fix is:
   R> system("cd mydir; echo x | latex myfile")
   Note that it's not as simple as  cmd <- paste("echo",input,"|",cmd).


3) R> myfun <- function(x, ...) {x[...] <- 0;  x}
   R> myfun(3)
   Error in myfun(3) : SubAssignArgs: invalid number of arguments

   It failed because no ... was given.  Fortunately, this is easily patched:
   R> myfun <- function(x, ...) {if (missing(...)) x[]<-0 else x[...]<-0; x}


4) Missing functions:
   a) identical() [scheduled for 1.4.0]
   b) slice.index()
   c) rowSums(), colSums(), colVars(), etc.
   d) unpaste() - R has strsplit, whose result is like the transpose of unpaste


5) rowsum() gives character dimnames in S, factor numbers in R.
   I've reported this early, and Brian D. Ripley promised a fix in 1.4.0.


OK, the rest are just differences, not complaints.  In fact, sometimes they are
very good differences.

1) Same argument given twice produces an error in R; S takes the last one.
   S> mean(x=4, x=5)    # Returns 5
   R> mean(x=4, x=5)    # Error

2) row.names(y) <- LETTERS[1:3] coerces list to dataframe in S, is error in R.

3) Default "what" for scan in S is "", in R is double(0).

4) Default "quote" for scan is "'\"" in R, causes different behavior than S.

5) which(<numeric>) converts to logical in S, is an error in R.

6) The NULL returned by if(F){...} is invisible in R, visible in S.

7) The NULL returned by return() is visible in R, invisible in S.

8) Args to "var" differ, and R has "cov".  S na.method="a" is like R use="p".

9) var (or cov) drops dimensions in S, not R.

10) cut allows labels=F in R, not in S (also left.include=T becomes right=F).

11) substring(s,"x") <- "X" only works in S, but R has s <- gsub("x","X",s).

12) S function casefold() replaced in R by toupper() or tolower().

13) Functions missing from S: sub(), gsub(), chartr(), toupper(), tolower()

14) Log scale indicated in S with par(xaxt)=="l", in R with par("xlog")==T.

?summary.lm

refers under "Value:" to something called "lm.obj".  Shouldn't that be
"object"?


Similarly

?summary.glm

refers under "Arguments:dispersion:", and again under "See also:", to something
called "glm.obj", which again looks like it ought to be "object" or "x"?


Apologies for reporting two at once, but these seem to be so similar as to be
best taken together.

Apologies also if I am missing some convention which makes these not errors.

Also in assign() there some arguments lacking in R such as 'frame' and

None of the web page on bug tracking, the ?bug.report help page,

 - that only one bug should go in each report

something
is a bug.

I'd add this to the bug.report disclaimer:

"If you are not sure if what you see is a bug, please discuss it on the r-devel

mailing list first.  If you are sure, please copy the bug report 
(after finishing it) to your favorite email program and send it to

The other places could have more verbose versions of this advice, including 
advice not to cc it to other lists.

I think we do not want to change this.

Splus has

> (1:2)[c(NA,2)]
[1] NA  2
> is.na((1:2)[c(NA,2)])
[1] T F
> is.na(c(TRUE, FALSE)[c(NA,2)])
[1] T F

etc, so I think the logic would be that we get NA whenever we subscript
by NA.  The current Splus behavior for character vectors is different,
and I do not see why it should.  Note that in R,

R> is.na(LETTERS[c(NA,2)])
[1]  TRUE FALSE

so we really have NA but it is printed as "NA" (and this might be
another case where <NA> would be better).

Doug Bates had raised this issue some time ago.  In the interest of
keeping the S language core as small as possible, I'd rather recommend
against adding these.  We can basically do that same using apply(), and
if the point is to have fast C code I think we should rather
special-case apply accordingly.

This is a function from the chron package, and it is also available in
the R version of chron.  Again, I am not sure whether this should be in
the S language core: we have strsplit.

I am a happy (but serious) user of simplex optimisation in "optim".  I
think that it would be a very good idea to be able to over-ride the
default initial simplex through an argument to the "control" list.  So
if you do the hack please publish it, and if not, let me know and I will
have a go instead.

You have 900 columns and only 270 rows, hence you should have a
vertical rectangle that is approx. 3 times as wide as high.

The difference to calling image() on a matrix is deliberate: if you
store a picture as a matrix (as usual), then you'd expect element 1,1
of that matrix to correspond to the upper left corner. That is
different from what image() does, because it was designed for doing
the right thing for matrices produced by, e.g., outer() ... [at least
I think that's the reason for image() rotating the matrix].

Best,
Fritz

I agree with the point that the upper left corner must be the
1,1 cell in the matrix for a "natural" display of the matrix
as an image. But this does not mean that the matrix should be rotated.
In all image processing packages that I know of, an image with
200 cols and 100 rows is displayed as a horizontal rectangle. Note
that, if there is geometric correction to a geographic projection,
the columns go W to E as left to right and the rows N to S as
top to bottom. In fact,
the "natural" display should follow the same geometry than print,
i.e.,

> matrix(1:12,ncol=6,nrow=2)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9   11
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10   12
> 

should be displayed as a horizontal rectangle.

Of course you can do it as you want because this is your package,
but are you sure that you want it the way it is?

Agus

Fixed now for r-devel. Will commit shortly.

(Martin, here's a way to test all characters:

 x <- y <- unlist(as.list(
   parse(text=paste("\"\\",
         as.character(structure(0:255,class="octmode")),
         "\"",sep=""))))
 save(x, ascii=T, file="here")
 load("here")
 all(x==y)

- I'd commit it for the regression test suite, but I'm not sure what
our conventions are for temporary files)

BTW: printing and deparsing x and y causes display corruption. Perhaps
we should have an isprint somewhere?

Hi!

The function get.hist.quote in the package tseries (Version 0.7-6) does not work
in 
my computer. 
I found that it uses the function strptime which did not "understand" English
month
names in my Finnish locale (see bug report 811). I changed the regional settings
to 
be English (UK) and strptime started to work as I liked. However, get.hist.quote
does 
not work yet, since the function julian does not work. Is this problem only in
my computer? The previous version of get.hist.quote (tseries 0.7-0) did work.

Sys.time and julian produce

I think NA and "NA" are treated in a very confusing way in R.  In y
below, I construct an NA the way you did above; in z, I use the string
'NA'.  As far as I can tell the vectors are identical.  In w, I use
paste(NA), and get something different.  I also tried paste('NA'), and
get something that looks like w.

Doug was responding to a request from a poster at fmr.com (I believe
it was David in fact) for the colSums function.  I showed how an add-on
package with this function could be created.  I'm sure that all these
functions could be added easily in a separate package.  

Perhaps I was overly subtle in my phrasing but I wrote the message on
how to create a package so as to encourage others to add these
functions instead of relying on a member of the core group having the
time and inclination to do so.

I agree with Kurt that we would want to have a strong reason for
adding these functions to the base language.  Kurt has actively
promoted the idea of basing R on a small, tight language core that is
supplemented by packages.  Toward this end Kurt has done an incredible
amount of work on tools for package attachment, checking, and
documentation.

The goal of a small tight language core supplemented by
user-contributed modules is in keeping with the spirit of open source
projects.  The R core team, especially Kurt and Fritz, devote
considerable effort to creating tools to make it easy for others to
contribute their work.  A commercial developer is more inclined to
define the language and capabilities in house where they have control
and where they can provide support.  This is not a criticism of
commercial development.  If you are required to provide support for
the software you must be able to control the code.

Those on the r-devel list may want to check the web site
                   http://developer.r-project.org/
occasionally.  Some plans for the future and items for discussion are
given there.

Excactly, I agree with everything you say!

you mean it doesn't do that? which version of pixmap, which version of
R on which platform?

Using 

R> x <- matrix(1:12,ncol=6,nrow=2)
R> library(pixmap)
R> plot(as.pixmap(x))

I get the attached picture, which is what you want, no?

Best,

Hello, R-devel!

I posted to R-help, and (inappropriately) to R-bugs, this R/S-Plus difference:
> LETTERS[c(NA,2)] in S is c("","B"), but in R is c("NA","B")

Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at> wrote:

This is merely a statement about is.na(), namely that it flags the string
"NA".  There is no distinction in R between the "NA" that arises from
subsetting with a missing value, and the "NA" that represents Nabisco.  Note:
  R> all.equal(LETTERS[c(NA,2)][1], substring("NABISCO",1,2))
  [1] TRUE

R thinks I am missing data when I trade Nabisco, in the Netherlands/Antilles,
or through trader Neil Armstrong.  In each case, "" would more likely indicate
a missing value; there is no stock with that ticker, country with that symbol,
or trader with those initials.

I'd think it would be easy to make is.na() flag "" instead of "NA".  However,
I'm stuck at the definition:
  R> is.na
  .Primitive("is.na")
so I don't know how to change it (I'm a lousy developer, you see).

I propose again that we provide options(na.char="NA"), so users can make their
own choice.  Thanks for listening!

Other's have been on the warpath re. this issue lately (and it's been
an annoyance for years - NorAdrenalin, Nitric Acid, etc.). It's not
unlikely to find a solution for 1.4, but probably not the one you are
proposing. Basically, we should have a *real* NA for string variables,
distinct from the character string "NA" and propagating like any other
NA's.

Inserting a value to substitute for missing could be handled
differently, e.g. via

replace.na <- function(x,r){x[is.na(x)]<-r; x}

I think we do want to change this (as we discussed quite recently) but by
adding a genuine character NA.  The problem is not that LETTERS[c(NA,2)]
returns a missing value, it's that it isn't missing enough. We need a
"NaS" (Not a String) value that can't be confused with Nabisco, but also
can't be confused with an empty string.

I could go for that.  How would it appear when cat()ed or print()ed?

Agreed.  As Peter said, subscripting by NA should give NA but R cannot
distinguish a string NA from the string NA.  However, David (I think)
was suggesting that subscripting a string with NA should give an empty
string, which I think cannot be right.  It must be NaS in your sense.

I think <NA> to distinguish from "NA".

R 1.4.0 already has

    o   Printing factors with both level "NA" and missing values
        uses `<NA>' for the missing values to distinguish them.

I am confused by the subject: above you indicate that get.hist.quote
does not work because julian does not work.

What precisely are your locale settings?

But it does make some sort of distinction, as my example contrasting
"NA" with paste(NA) shows.  In case you missed it:

Yes.  is.na() of a string is true if that string is actually a reference
to R_NaString.  Parsing a literal "NA" will give R_NaString, as will
coercing NA from some other type.  However, paste() doesn't check whether
it produces "NA". Neither does toupper()
  > is.na(toupper("na"))
  [1] FALSE
  > toupper("na")
  [1] "NA"


So we're partway there already, in fact.  It looks like we basically
need to
1) stop the parser generating R_NaString from \"NA\"
2) Change PRINTNAME(R_NaString) to avoid ambiguity

One more (at least :-))

3) fix saveload.c to preserve NA status in strings.

Right now we have

> x<-as.character(list(NA, "NA", paste(NA)))
> x
[1] "NA" "NA" "NA"
> is.na(x)
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> save(list="x", file="tmp.RData")
> load("tmp.RData")
> x
[1] "NA" "NA" "NA"
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE

It's easy enough to fix in principle--just add another case to
NewSaveSpecialHook and NewLoadSpecialHook.  Unfortunately this means
workspace files that contain string NA's written with this new
convention won't be readable by older versions of R (I think it will
generate an "unknown type" error) (and probably leave the file
opened).

Subject: [Rd] library(..., pos=4)
Message-ID: <200110042110.f94LAW627097@arbres1a.FMR.Com>

Hello again, r-devel,

   I propose adding a "pos" argument to library(), so that one can attach the
library in a position other than 2.  It seems straightforward, just 2 changes:

1) pos=2  at the end of the argument list,
2) env <- attach(NULL, pos, name=pkgname)  in line 22

Indeed the authors seem to have anticipated this by defining "lib.pos" further
on, rather than hard-coding it as 2.

   Please let me know (gently) if I have not described my request properly...

Submission from: (NULL) (140.107.26.74)


I noticed while reading some of the html documentation (e.g. R-intro.html) that
many of the internal links in the documents were broken.  At least they don't
work in Mozilla 0.9.3.  This is because the strings for the internal references
include %20 rather than just spaces.  This could easily be fixed with a perl
script to replace all instances of %20 with ' '.

I tried this on R-intro.html and it worked.

Spaces in links are *supposed* to be coded as %20, becauses
spaces are not allowed in URLs, including internal links. At
least, with some versions of Netscape, links with spaces don't
work.

ok, found the pronlem: my fault.
I was using v.0.1. With Version: 0.2-1
it's ok. 

I observe that you stretch lineraly now within
pixmap. The problem is that you use the max
of all 3 bands, which is not normally good.
Also an optional "normal" stretching should
provide better results in most cases. I'll 
send you the code and an attached example
(only to Friedrich.Leisch@ci.tuwien.ac.at to avoid
annoying other people) in a while.

the NEWS file in  1.4.0-devel states: 

o   mean() has `data frame' method applying mean column-by-column.
    When applied to non-numeric data mean() now returns NA rather

which means: 

R> mean(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] NA
Warning message: 
argument is not numeric: returning NA in: mean.default(c(TRUE, FALSE)) 

but: 

R> sum(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] 1

?sum states: 

     sum(..., na.rm=FALSE)

Arguments:

     ...: numeric vectors.

and clearly

R> is.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] FALSE


this is confusing, isn't it? I think that `sum' and `mean' should take the
same arguments (and one probably will not allow to sum up logicals) or am
I missing something?

Hmm. That slipped in without me noticing. Summing logicals is a fairly
common practice, as in 

sem <- sd(x,na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))

Taking means of logicals is somewhat more rare, but it does work in
Splus 6.0 and it is a general rule coerce to logicals to 0/1, so I
suspect that this is just an oversight and we want mean.default to
start with

    if (!is.numeric(x) && !is.complex(x) && !is.logical(x)) {
        warning("argument is not numeric: returning NA")
        return(as.numeric(NA))

If Brian really meant otherwise, he'll explain why when he gets back
from Switzerland...

I think this is what you are interested in:

   R (1.3.1) appears to have a bug (well a mis-feature, I suppose).

   It places architecture-specific and architecture-dependent files in
the same locations.  This means that the common files cannot be shared
across installations on multiple architectures.

   It would be nice if it could separate these under exec_prefix and
prefix and look in the relevant one for each file.

Back-compatibility.  In data frames logicals used to get coerced to
two-level factors, not to numerics, and then mean would fail for them.
If a logical is an experimental factor, sums make sense but means do not.

Here is what I find confusing (1.3.1).

> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
> mean(x)
[1] 0.5
> DF <- data.frame(x = x)
> mean(DF$x)
Error in Summary.factor(..., na.rm = na.rm) :
        "sum" not meaningful for factors

There 1.4.0 is consistent.

Change it if you like, but do think through all the implications of the
inconsistent treatment of logicals (for which I have not had time as yet).

What would be `nice' about it? There are `architecture-specific' (also
known as `architecture-dependent', sic) files all over the place in R.
There are few files that are not platform-dependent: for example many of
the help files and the base R code file are.  Many of these are not
executables and do not belong under `exec_prefix'.

This cannot be a space issue this century (as it was originally I believe),
as surely you can afford the disc space for copies of R for each of a
sensible number of platforms?

Suppose one did combine the trees for i386-linux and ppc-linux.  What do
you think would happen when i386-linux is upgraded and ppc-linux is not?
And R is designed to be upgraded on the fly, using update.packages().  We
have public R installations for sparc-solaris, i386-linux and Windows and
sharing them for R would be a nightmare for the administrators.  (We do
share them for TeX, for example.)

I changed the title, because this is not about browser() but about HTML
viewers, and the problem is on Unix not Windows.

I think it's a within-Unix-platform problem, mainly.  The other two ports
have a simple procedure: it's Unix/Linux where the problems arise.

And last time we tested this that only works if the browser is netscape
4.7x, so the freedom is illusory.

Look at help, just as you should for Unix.

?shell.exec

(A better way to say this is that is completely different under Unix, but
Mac and Windows are similar.)

Yes, one might be able to persuade the Unix world to agree on one ....
What help() does does not even work with Netscape 6.01 (and I have yet to
try it with 6.1).

Actually, only the deparsing of the expression is wrong, cf:

> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]]
exp(-x - xmid/scal)
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]]
-x - xmid/scal
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]][[2]]
-x - xmid
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]][[2]][[2]]
x - xmid

I.e. the expression is really exp((-(x - xmid))/scal). It is a
well-known problem with the deparser that it doesn't parenthesize
properly based on operator hierarchy. Similarly, the parser should
probably drop parentheses in most cases.

r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk

Hi,

I have found something I guess is a bug in write.table.  When saving
the object "e2" (see the session transcription below, I have attached
the Rdata file in gzipped form), the resulting table (also attached)
contains a spurious space in the front of columns from starting the
column "c05ak01" (column 234).

This would not be a problem, but if the object is large (the original
database contained not 10 but 7000 observations), some of the colums
are missing at all.  The problem is similar when you use quote=FALSE
option.

Best wishes

Message-ID: <3BC1D795.A8F6E86D@umsanet.edu.bo>

Hola!

I have problems running Rcmd check (windows 98, R1.3.0)

It ckoks on an example running a function which calla bringToTop().
This makes an error because Rcmd check runs the examples with the
postscript device, and bringToTop does not make sense with that device.

Howevere, my function is for interactive use, and needs bringToTop. 
How can this be used in examples and still have the possibility to use
the automatic
error checking? I also used par(ask=TRUE) and identify in
examples, but gac
ve up on that. But there is a general problem that the automatic running 
of example code chocks on code which make sense interactively, 
but not in batch mode. How can this be solved?

Also, it would be nice if the control of exampkles would not stop
on the first error, but control with further examples, to find all
errors in one run.

Use \dontrun{} as described in the  R-exts  manual.

You might want to change the following lines in the perl script "check"
in R's bin directory:

  if(Rsystem($cmd)) {
    $log->error("running examples failed");
    exit(1);
  }

Is this a bug?

 1 NA 
 1  3 

It has some annoying consequences, e.g.

> median( matrix(1:9,nc=3,dimnames=list(1:3,1:3))[1,,drop=F] )
NA 
 4

The above was for 

Version:
 platform = sparc-sun-solaris2.7
 arch = sparc
 os = solaris2.7
 system = sparc, solaris2.7
 status = 
 major = 1
 minor = 3.0
 year = 2001
 month = 06
 day = 22
 language = R


The behavior seems to differ slightly in 1.3.1.

On Windows 1.3.1  

 matrix(1:9,nc=3,dimnames=list(1:3,1:3))[ cbind(1:3,1:3) ]

omits the names (as is my preference).

Perhaps a clearer example is

> a[1]
A
1

B
2

It's at least a wart that you sometimes get the row names and sometimes
NA.  OTOH it's not clear what the names of a vector extracted from a
matrix *should* be if the vector isn't a single row or column.

Use interactive() in your code to not use code that only makes sense
interactively.

You can set options(error) to do that.

Message-ID: <3BC2A1BB.7E2FE27B@durham.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

I know that Kurt is thinking about slimming down the core functions of R
and putting more stuff into libraries.  I was wondering if, as a first
step, thought had been given to re-organising the source code to
separate out the S-language functionality from the base package
functions. I am thinking in particular of the subdirectory src/main
which contains both top-level files such as "memory.c" and base-package
files such as "optim.c".  Would it not be clearer to mount the base
package entirely on src/library and so put the required C files into the
subdirectory src/library/base/src (which currently does not exist)?

Cheers, Jonathan.

Not really.  If base remains a package, then base.so would have always to
be loaded, and no reduction would result.  Also optim() etc are
implemented via .Internal, and at present .Internal functions (and
primitives) are determined by a compiled-in table.  So the net result
would a lot of work, slower loading and probably a net increase in the
size of the running image.

It seems to me that slimming-down will only work (well) once we can split
base into a number of sub-packages which are auto-loaded as needed (not
necessarily by the autoload mechanism), and namespaces will be useful when
going along that route.   Most of the space we could save is R code, not
compiled C code.   I introduced modules to save much of the latter.

Brian

Hmm. This is a consequence of

> x[[2]]<- letters[1:2]
Error: more elements supplied than there are to replace

which S-PLUS does differently. However, I'm not sure we really want
this to change for the following reason:

> x<-NULL
> x[[2]]<- letters[1:2]
> x
$"":
NULL

$value:
[1] "a" "b"

> x<-NULL
> x[[2]]<-"1"
> x
[1] ""  "1"

Now what does this do if the array extent has length 1?

>  x <- matrix(1:2,2)
>  dimnames(X)[[2]] <- "a"
Problem in dimnames(X) <- .A0: Component 2 of dimnames has length 1, should be 2

Phillipe,

As Thomas noted, R does not currently allow testing whether a function is
being debugged.  However, it is possible to add this feature.  I'm attaching
a patch to the end of this message that adds a new internal function
"isdebug" which tests if its (only) argument is a function with debugging
enabled.

It can be used by:

	> f <- function() 1
	> isdebug(f)
	[1] FALSE
	> debug(f)
	> isdebug(f)
	[1] TRUE	

Using this, it is simple construct a function that gets a list of current
objects and uses isdebug to determine which are functions with debugging
enabled:

	> listdebug <- function(envir=globalenv())
	+   {
	+     test <- function(x) 
	+       { 
	+         fun <- get(x)
	+         if(is.function(fun))
	+           return( isdebug(x) )
	+         else
	+           return(FALSE)
	+       }
	+ 
	+     fnames <- objects(envir=envir)
	+     flag <- sapply(fnames, test)
	+     if(length(flag)>0)
	+       fnames[flag]
	+     else
	+       NULL
	+   }
	> 
	> x <- 7
	> y <- 8
	> f <- function() 1
	> g <- function() 2
	> 
	> debug(f)
	> 
	> ls()
	[1] "f"         "g"         "listdebug" "test"      "x"         "y"

	> 
	> listdebug()
	[1] "f"
	> 
	>

I think there is a problem when computing Pearson residuals, in that they seem
to be computed at the raw residuals divided by the square root of the
corresponding diagonal element of the weight matrix W evaluated at the last step
of the iterative model fitting procedure (IWLS), instead of dividing by the
square root of the model variance. Here's an example of the weird effects it
produces:

> me <- c(1:100)/2
> y <- rpois(100,me)
> yglm <- glm(y~me-1, family=poisson(link="identity"))
> plot(fitted(yglm), residuals(yglm,type="response"))
 
plots the raw residuals... but
 
> plot(fitted(yglm), residuals(yglm,type="pearson"))
 
plots the raw residuals MULTIPLIED by sqrt(fitted(yglm))... because it
computes the Pearson residuals dividing by the square root of the diagonal
element of the weight matrix W (at the end of the iterative fitting process)
rather than dividing by the sqrt of variance.

Um, right... At the very least, there's a "/" that should have been
"*". But do we also divide by the dispersion (when it is estimated)? I
forget what the definition says.

I don't think we do divide by the dispersion -- all the flavours of
residual are supposed to be the same for the normal/identity case.

Subject: [Rd] Wrong df in bartlett.test when subsetting data (PR#1124)
Message-ID: <200110101543.RAA01459@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jens Lund
Version: 1.3.1
OS: Windows
Submission from: (NULL) (194.239.194.210)


When we subset a dataset bartlett.test does not calculate the df correctly:

X <- rnorm(50)     # Generate simulated samples
f <- gl(10,5)      # Generate a factor with 10 levels and
                   # 5 replications of each level

# Works correctly
bartlett.test(X,f) # Correct number of df = 9

# Just use the first 5 levels of f
# Does not work correctly
bartlett.test(X[1:25],f[1:25]) # Should have df = 4, but uses df = 9
bartlett.test(X~f,subset=1:25) # Should have df = 4, but uses df = 9

In version 1.2.2 the problem could be solved by substituting
        k <- nlevels(g)
with    k <- length(unique(g))
(I do not get the R-code in the new version get by typing bartlett.test at the
prompt.)

This might leed to a discussion on whether nlevels should return the number of
attained factor levels or the number of "theoretical" levels:
nlevels(f)       # Returns 10, fine!
nlevels(f[1:25]) # Returns 10, might not be fine; 5 might be the correct
answer.
The same question might be asked for levels, levels(f) versus levels(f[1:25]).
At least the documentation should be clear on this point, which I do not think
it is now. (Perhaps the levels attribute on the factor should be changed for a
subset of the data, but this is probably not an efficient way of doing
things...)

A similar problem also comes up with interactions between factors in unbalanced
designs:
g <- gl(2,40,50)
nlevels(f:g)         # Returns 20
length(unique(f:g))  # Returns 10
table(f,g)           # See the design

This bug has also been seen on version 1.2.2 on Linux, but is reproduced for
this bug report on:

I strongly believe that levels() and nlevels() are doing the right thing
here.  If a variable is a factor with two levels (eg Male & Female) then
it shouldn't stop being a factor with two levels just because you have a
small sample.  In particular, when you have a single observation g[i] it
is still important to know the set of levels it comes from, rather than
just the category it is in.

On http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk/cgi-bin/R pressing "new bug report" returns a new
form. It would, IMHO, be natural to place the "submit bug report" button on this
form *below* the input area for the actual bug report :-)

This is a documented feature: more accurately, newlines matter.  An R
statement is terminated if it is syntactically complete at the end of the
line.

See the reference manual section 10.2.5 for an explicit statement.

Which is listed as Thomas' doing, but I suspect it was discussed
internally, and thus a collective piece of absentmindedness.

What we have in glm.fit is

w <- sqrt((weights[good] * mu.eta.val[good]^2)/variance(mu)[good])

which later gets squared before it is returned, so the weights are
essentially 

mu.eta.val^2/variance(mu) 

which is what you are saying since the link derivatives are the
"backwards" d(mu)/d(eta). The thing that is confusing is that for a
loglinear Poisson model this comes out as mu^2/mu = mu. AFAIR, similar
cancellation happens in all canonical GLIMs.

For the identity link, it comes out as 1/mu, which is why it seemingly
worked to switch from divide to multiply....

(And of course in ordinary weighted regression, the weights *are* 
usually the reciprocal variances.)

Cc'ed to r-bugs, hoping that someone with a clear mind will do the
right thing...

Yes, in response to a previous bug report (?Atkinson) pointing out that
the old version was wrong when the link function was monotone decreasing
(Gamma/reciprocal).  It wasn't a confusion of * and /, it was a deeper
absentmindedness.

We can't just use $weights, although it does work for canonical links. We
need (y-mu)/sqrt(prior.weights*variance(mu))

Subject: [Rd] unary "-" doesn't convert logicals (PR#1127)
Message-ID: <200110112212.AAA14833@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: John M. Heumann
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Windows NT4/SP5
Submission from: (NULL) (192.25.140.108)


If unary "-" is applied to a logical vector, the resulting value
is computed correctly (i.e. coerced to a numeric), but the type
(incorrectly) remains logical: 

> x <- 1:10
> p1 <- (x > 5)
> p2 <- (-p1)
> is.logical(p2)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(p2)
[1] FALSE
> as.numeric(p1)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
> as.numeric(p2)
 [1]  0  0  0  0  0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Since "==" always does binary comparison, this can lead to
some bizarre behavior:

> p1
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> p2
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> (p1 == p2)
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
((!p1) == (!p2))
 [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

It was not a problem because 1.3.1 gave the wrong answer!  In 1.3.1 on a
postscript device, the background was not painted if white (the default),
but col=0 did paint white.  So the background colour was really
transparent, but col=0 was white.

In 1.4.0 white and transparent are distinct, and you can now set
transparent via an inline `col' setting.  (It was only allowed for direct
setting by par when you made the report.)

The issue was not col=0, but the colour that corresponded to.  Plotting in
col=0 is a lot less useful now, since it often does nothing.

Yup, that's a bug.

I wonder how long it has been around. The function definition is

> get("names<-.dist")
function (d, n) 
{
    if (length(n) != attr(d, "Size")) 
        stop("invalid names for dist object")
    attr(d, "Labels") <- n
    d
}

but the value is passed as a named argument called "value", and it has
been like that for ages.  The fix is obvious: replace "n" with "value"

Subject: [Rd] MASS: isoMDS and sammon
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0110122336360.560-100000@kleigh.nl>


If tbl is an object of class 'dist', you can do this:

    a <- sammon(tbl, k=3)


But you can't do this:

    b <- isoMDS(tbl, k=3)


Wouldn't it be sensible to have identical interfaces to sammon()
and isoMDS() ?

I think all that would be needed is to change this:

  isoMDS <- function(d, y=cmdscale(d, 2), maxit=50, trace=TRUE)
  {

...into this:

  isoMDS <- function(d, y, k=2, maxit=50, trace=TRUE)
  {
    if(missing(y)) y <- cmdscale(d, k=k)

Actually, it should work if you simply define the arguments as 

isoMDS <- function(d, y=cmdscale(d, k), k=2, maxit=50, trace=TRUE)

Default arguments can refer to each other and even to items calculated
inside the function.

You don't need to change anything to use dimensions other than 2 (and the
author of pcurve didn't realise this either, it seems).

Just call isoMDS with a k-dimensional start, as the help page says.
One reason for not making this easy is that the starting configuration
is critical and often one can do better than the default, particularly in
higher dimensions.  (Use the results of sammon(), for example, whihc is one
reason why they might need different interfaces.)

Both sammon and isoMDS are about 9 years old (predating MASS), and started
life in different S library sections.  I will not change the interfaces now
(and both proposals would break positional matching).  (They have
maxit vs niter too.)

I will write a test for this when I find some time ...

When I try to start RGUI, it generates an error in application and R chashs.
(NOTE: R worked very well with trial version of Windows 2000!)

Here is the (not very informative form me) Dr Watson's report:

Subject: [Rd] creating packages for Mac
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110150853460.20787-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  OK, a boneheaded question ...

  I've made a set of packages for my students.
  I'm serving these packages from my web site in the form of a set of
tar.gz source packages (constructed with R CMD build) and a set of .zip
Windows binary packages, constructed by cross-compiling according to Brian
Ripley's instructions (make pkg-foo in the src/gnuwin32 directory) and
then zipping up the directories.
  Now I'm wondering what to do for my students with Macs (besides insist
that they work on PCs).  For the most part my packages *don't* really
contain compiled binary information, and I'm not really planning on trying
to cross-compile Mac binaries on Linux (ugh).  All I really want to do is
provide the packages in a form that the students can unzip (or whatever)
reasonably simply.  I could try to look at the form in which the Mac stuff
is provided and replicate that file structure (which would also mean
finding a Linux application to create Stuffit archives), but I'm not sure
where to start.
  I guess the other possibility is convincing one of my students to
download the machinery for creating binary from source packages on their
machines.

  Any ideas?  Has anyone done this?

 Ben

I seem to recall a recommendation regarding a location for including
extra documentation in packages, but I cannot find it now. Where in a
package should I include a pdf file with a users' guide?

Thanks,
Paul Gilbert

My recommendation would be

	inst/doc/foo.pdf

If you don't need to compile binaries you should just give the .zip 
archives to your students and they will work fine under R for MacOS.

If you need to compile .C of fortran sources you need the "machinery" as 
on any other platform.

In the latest R-devel archive there are MPW makefiles that you can use 
to build mac binaries yourself. For the time being, I can help you in 
compiling sources and prepeare the script files. Let me know.

Regards,

			Stefano

Subject: [Rd] possible bugs: boundary conditions and random distribution parameters
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110151554240.22158-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  There are a few inconsistencies, at least, in some of the functions that
generate random deviates from particular distributions (I think they're
bugs because they're inconvenient, but maybe someone can make an argument
for the current behavior).  If people think these are really bugs I can
submit them, together or separately.

1. rlnorm(n,mean,sd) gives NaN for sd=0, rather than always returning
the mean.  This is inconsistent with rnorm(), which returns the mean.

2. rnbinom(n,prob,size) gives NaN when prob=1; always returning 0 would be
reasonable, and consistent with the output of dnbinom().  [This is
equivalent to rnbinom(n,mu=0,size) in the new parameterization.]

3. rgamma(n,shape,scale) happily returns 0 when shape=0.  However,
dgamma(x,shape=0) [and pgamma(x,shape=0)] gives NaN.  This behavior is
actually convenient for me, but I could make an argument for returning a
warning in this case.

  The fixes seem straightforward.

Subject: [Rd] plot function
Message-ID: <3BCC374F.7D553701@umsanet.edu.bo>

Hola!

It is somewhat inconvenient to use plot.function, when add=TRUE.

The following (miniscule) change makes it behave better:

 plot.function <-
function (fn, from , to, xlim = NULL, ...) 
{
    if (!is.null(xlim)) {
        if (missing(from)) 
            from <- xlim[1]
        if (missing(to)) 
            to <- xlim[2]
    }
    curve(fn, from, to, xlim = xlim, ...)
}

The only change is that the default arguments fro from and to
are omitted. (curve() has better code to give sensible defaults)

But this makes problems for curve when add=FALSE is used.

The following miniscule changes to curve restores its behaviour when
add=FALSE: (changes only local to the delay() expression)

curve <- 
function (expr, from, to, n = 101, add = FALSE, type = "l", ylab = NULL, 
    log = NULL, xlim = NULL, ...) 
{
    sexpr <- substitute(expr)
    if (is.name(sexpr)) {
        fcall <- paste(sexpr, "(x)")
        expr <- parse(text = fcall)
        if (is.null(ylab)) 
            ylab <- fcall
    }
    else {
        if (!(is.call(sexpr) && match("x", all.vars(sexpr), nomatch =
0))) 
            stop("'expr' must be a function or an expression containing
'x'")
        expr <- sexpr
        if (is.null(ylab)) 
            ylab <- deparse(sexpr)
    }
    lims <- if (is.null(xlim)) 
        delay({
            if (add) {
            pu <- par("usr")[1:2] } else
            pu <- c(0,1)
            if (par("xlog")) 
                10^pu
            else pu
        }, environment())
    else xlim
    if (missing(from)) 
        from <- lims[1]
    if (missing(to)) 
        to <- lims[2]
    lg <- if (length(log)) 
        log
    else paste(if (add && par("xlog")) 
        "x", if (add && par("ylog")) 
        "y", sep = "")
    x <- if (lg != "" && "x" %in% strsplit(lg, NULL)[[1]]) {
        if (any(c(from, to) <= 0)) 
            stop("`from' & `to' must be > 0      with  log=\"x\"")
        exp(seq(log(from), log(to), length = n))
    }
    else seq(from, to, length = n)
    y <- eval(expr, envir = list(x = x), enclos = parent.frame())
    if (add) 
        lines(x, y, type = type, ...)
    else plot(x, y, type = type, ylab = ylab, xlim = xlim, log = lg, 
        ...)
}

In the following special case, seq fails to give the right answer
(which is  0 )

> seq(0,0,1)
Error in if (dd < sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)) return(from) : 
	missing value where logical needed

For any other equal  from  and  to , it works:

> seq(1,1,1)
[1] 1

The error occurs in the statement

            dd <- abs(del)/max(abs(to), abs(from))

of  seq.default  -- for obvious reasons. 
This is certainly easy to debug...

Thank you for your efforts.

Full_Name: John M. Heumann
Version: 1.3.1

Submission from: (NULL) (192.25.140.108)


Picture 2 scenarios:
   (I) R command window sitting at prompt (no program executing)
      a) Do close action: "X" icon, or Alt-F4, or right click on RGui icon
         and select close.
      b) "Save workspace image" dialog appears.
      c) Press cancel. Program does not exit. This is all correct.

   (II) As in (I) but with a program running in the command window
        (e.g. 'source "foo.r"').
        Perform a), b), c) as above. Once again, RGui does not exit
        (which is correct). However the running program will be terminated
        as if you'd hit Escape, which is not correct. I suspect the
"Esc/Cancel"
        message is being passed on up to RGui, rather than trapped and 
        handled by the dialog.

OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

EMRG from $ .60 to $2.50 in 10 days for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!!!
DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)
BUY AT $1.80
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !!!!

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
NEXT WEEK FOR ROYA !!!

Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted financial
services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher this year due to 9
Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, placing rates at their
lowest levels in almost 4 decades.

ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real estate
sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is on with rates
having dropped to bargain basement levels.

We are expecting significant news next week regarding increasing
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing the bottom line for
rapid revenue growth.  The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think
the stock could easily climb above $6 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS ROYA MAY
VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!

Sorry to jump in rather late on a topic which is bordering off topic
but if Debian people are interested I was working for a while distributing
Linux in Australia and I'm still in touch with the industry, I'll point
out a few observations:

* Debian `potato' CDs were popular when they came out but now they are far 
  too out of date to sell.

* Distributers don't want to make up their own unofficial Debian CDs they
  want something complete, tested and ready to stamp CDs.

* The various minibook/pocketbooks have are always popular and I don't think
  that Debian has ever been included on one of these (various combinations
  of RedHat, Mandrake, and TurboLinux have been).

* The RedHat 7.1 CDs (GPL set) are still popular and the `PowerTools' CD
  includes R-base-1.2.0 and RedHat now have quite low prices on their 
  low-end offerings so people aren't being scared off by the boxed-set premium.

Basically the Australian market is very interested in getting distributions
on CD because not many people have the tinme and money to download the entire
Debian sid down a modem. This is not in any way a comment on the quality of
the Debian product but an observation that current Debian packaging is not
doing much for the distribution of that product.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Unfortunately it seems that RH7.2 will have no PowerTools, but only
the "most important" items from it rolled into the main distribution,
*not* including R (it's not in the beta anyway). On the other hand,
the PowerTools distros have been persistently out of date...

Mandrake 8.2 has R version 1.3.0 as far as I remember.

Subject: [Rd] cex/col/etc. in title(): documentation? (PR#1136)
Message-ID: <200110221551.RAA09762@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  There appears to be a mismatch between the documentation and behavior of
title(), or at least a clarification is in order.  The documentation says
you can pass extra arguments from par() as "...".  However, cex at least
is ignored. Later on in the documentation it becomes clear that you can
specify these extra parameters as part of a list.

  I wouldn't say this is necessarily a bug (and there's certainly a way to
do what you want, if you read the rest of the documentation), but I will
say it didn't seem to follow the same conventions as most of the rest of
the graphical annotation in R.  I would have expected
title(main="foo",cex=2) to set the title larger ...

  I think it would be nicer if title() worked this way, but if it doesn't
it would be nice to have an additional note in the documentation for "..."
to the effect that parameters such as cex, col, etc., should be set using
the list mechanism described below.

## setting parameter with par(): works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  par(cex=i)
  title(main="hello")
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing parameter as part of a list: works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main=list("hello",cex=i))
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing cex as an additional arg: doesn't work
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main="hello",cex=i)
}

Hi, all,

   I swear, bug.report() ate my message!  Apologies to all, esp. Peter who
will once again have to clean up after my mess...

   The bug report was supposed to say:

R> round(100000/3, -2) - 33300
   [1] -7.275958e-12

I would have hoped for 0.  The problem seems to be specifically for negative
"digits".

^^^^^^^^
I can duplicate this under Windows R1.3.0 but not Debian R1.3.1, so it may
have been fixed.  Looking at the changes to arithmetic.c I don't see why,
though.

I would have hoped for 0.  The problem seems to be specifically for negative
"digits".  This is in 1.3.1 on Solaris 2.6 (full description at bottom).

[Apologies for making everyone read this 3 times; my bug.report() burped.]

Peter Dalgaard <p.dalgaard@biostat.ku.dk> says the problem is in fround.c,
which reads in part:
    pow10 = R_pow_di(10., dig)
    ...
    return sgn * (intx + R_rint(x * pow10) / pow10);
and (says Peter),
> the problem is most likely that pow10 (== 1/100) has no finite binary
> representation. Patches are welcome...

I'm not up to patching C code, but I will say that a workaround is:
R> round(round(100000/3, -2)) - 33300
   [1] 0
and a smarter C-programmer could probably implement this concept:
if digits < 0, force the final result to an integer.

It's an accuracy issue, still there in 1.3.1 for Solaris 7. Basically,
dividing by 10^-2 does not always give an integer on SPARC, so we
should be more careful with the logic in fround.c. Beats me why it
would act up on windows, but, well, ...

Subject: [Rd] Possible bug, Rprof() and scan(pipe()) (PR#1140)
Message-ID: <200110232051.WAA27074@pubhealth.ku.dk>

This looks like a bug?
Unable to use scan(pipe()) while profiling.
I have no idea whether this version of R violates the
    "do not use `Rprof' in an executable built for profiling"
warning in ?Rprof.

Thanks

Well, Doug recently paid the dues for r-project.org and
cran.us.r-project.org is working OK from here. Some joker may have
hijacked some name servers though.

Yeah ... it is doing that where I work but not from my ISP. Life in the
digital age, I guess ... I was going to volunteer to pay a year or two
if it really *had* expired, since I don't have time to contribute any *code*.

I just bought two more domains myself; they're *really* cheap these days if
all you want is to have them point somewhere.

Subject: [Rd] broken build with LDFLAGS (PR#1141)
Message-ID: <200110240928.LAA02209@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Denis Sunko
Version: 1.3.1
OS: HP-UX 11.0
Submission from: (NULL) (161.53.2.114)


I invoked configure by

env LDFLAGS=/opt/fortran90/lib ./configure --with-f77=f90

Problem: although configure completed to (its own) satisfaction, the LDFLAGS
information was not propagated everywhere; I had to change the line

PKG_LIBS =   -l:libF90.a -lcl -lisamstub

to

PKG_LIBS =   -L/opt/fortran90/lib -l:libF90.a -lcl -lisamstub

in the files

src/library/ctest/src/Makefile
src/library/modreg/src/Makefile
src/library/mva/src/Makefile
src/library/ts/src/Makefile

by hand.

------
On the wish-list level (not really a bug): it would be nice if configure broke
with a less cryptic message than `f90 and gcc do not agree on int and double',
when all that happens is that it cannot find the fortran library. I suggest
putting -l:libF90.a on the compiler line of a previous (dummy) test program,
just to check for this.

After building and installing R 1.3.1, i find some of the html files missing:

> ls -l /opt/lib/R/doc/manual/
total 0
-rw-r--r--   1 root       sys              0 Oct 17 22:16 R-FAQ.html

-rw-r--r--   1 root       sys              0 Oct 17 22:16 R-lang.html

I can trace this to the lines

.texi.html:
        $(MAKEINFO) --no-split --html -I$(srcdir) $< -o $@ || touch $@

in the file

doc/manual/Makefile

where MAKEINFO is defined (in the same file)

MAKEINFO = false

(correctly, because I don't have the info system installed).

The html files for the packages are all built correctly. The final front
(index)
page for the html documentation also has broken links to various COPYING,
THANKS,
etc. pages.

Well, those files are based on texinfo sources. Without the makeinfo
program you're not going to get them built...

(This is orthogonal to having the info *reader* system installed).

so here goes!  I've only tested it stand-alone, not compiled into the full R
system.  I handle the 3 cases dig=0, dig>0, and dig<0 separately, and note I
avoid a call to R_pow_di altogether in the common case of dig=0.  Hope this is
useful.

Is this still an issue to this community?  If so, and results, I may pick
this up.  Intel does have C++ and Fortran compilers.

You might see a compiler among the list under the links
http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/topic.jsp?catCode=BON.
Evaluation licenses are available at 
http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/

If they are promising, perhaps binaries could at least be built using Intel
compilers.  

But first, are there any R tasks/workloads that we might comparably
benchmark?

Under what OS?

AFAIK the only thing one can do is to find a compiler that optimizes for
the P4, but I don't know of one, nor if it actually helps.  As far as I am
aware under both Linux and Windows the binary versions of R are not
even optimized for an i686 (Pentium Pro/II/III), but I find that under
Windows (and VC++) using the optimizations for i686 makes only negligible
differences.

An easily evaluated benchmark of R performance on Unix/Linux systems
is obtained by running "make check" after building from the sources.
I know there is a similar check done for compilations under Windows
but I don't know how it is run.

"make check" runs every example in every help page in every package
that is shipped with R.  The base package contains the most important
and most commonly used functions.  If everything is successful the
last few lines of the file ./tests/Examples/base-Ex.Rout should read
like

 > cat("Time elapsed: ", proc.time() - get("ptime", env = .CheckExEnv),"\n")
 Time elapsed: 84.22 1.9 105.61 0.82 0.61
 > dev.off(); quit('no')
 null device
           1
The times, in seconds, are the user time, the system time, and
the elapsed (wall clock) time for the parent process, and elapsed and
system times for child processes.  The user time for the parent
process is probably the most important.

The run shown above is for the r-devel sources on a Linux system with
a 1.2 GHz Athlon and 1 GB of PC-133 memory.  The compilers were gcc
and g77 from the 2.95.4 compiler suite.  This compiled version does
use atlas BLAS but that should not make much of a difference on this
benchmark.

Subject: [Rd] Problem testing R version 1.3.1 (PR#1143)
Message-ID: <200110261542.RAA02442@pubhealth.ku.dk>

   I have compiled R version 1.3.1 on a Linux system.  No errors or
warnings are reported.

  However, "make check" fails thus:

=====
make[5]: Leaving directory
`/proj/informatics-build/GML/R/R-1.3.1/src/library'
running code in base-Ex.R ...
../../bin/R --vanilla < base-Ex.R > base-Ex.Rout
make[4]: *** [base-Ex.Rout] Error 139
=====

   The base-Ex.Rout being produced at this point ends with:

=====
> ## 1-d tables
> (Poiss.tab <- table(N = rpois(200, lam= 5)))
N
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 18
 1  4 14 21 46 40 24 14 19 11  3  2  1
=====

   Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the problem may be?


   The configuration parametsr used are:

environment parameters:

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-O2
FC='g77 -L/usr/central/lib'
FFLAGS=-O2
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/common/include
LIBS=-L/usr/central/lib

./configure --prefix=/proj/informatics-build/GML/R/Linux-ia32 \
   --without-readline --without-tcltk --without-gnome


(An equivalent build on an SGI Irix6.5 system also compiles, with
various warnings, but then fails to paas the checks either, but fails on
a later script).

Unfortunately, the output is buffered so that one on catastrophic
error will lose the last bit. It might be more informative if you ran the
command directly, without the redirection to base-Ex.Rout.

No,
but since you're on Linux you can find much more yourself :
Run R inside the debugger:

cd tests/Examples
../../bin/R -d gdb

 and then in (gdb) 

r --vanilla < base-Ex.R

 and it will (hopefully) stop at the same place
 but you'll see more

Odd. There are known issues with stock RH 6.2, but base R usually
compiles and passes make check on those systems. What usually happens
is that some packages refuse to dynload, with the error you're
observing, essentially.

The culprit is somewhere in the compiler suite - 2.95.x is known to
work, and I believe 3.0.x too (whereas the unofficial 2.96 from RH 7.0
caused trouble although later ones for 7.1 and 7.2 seem OK). You might
as well upgrade since R-1.4.0 will definitely not work with that
setup.

We've seen this one before. It's usually due to a problem with the Fortran
compile or flags such as linking in a math library compiled with different
flags from R.

   Confirmed.  I've just found a Mandarke7.2 system with gcc 2.95.2 on,
and that passes the check (as does the RH6.2 system when using these
same binaries).

   Thanks.

   Now to track down the SGI problem....(which is already using gcc
2.95.2).

Message-ID: <200110261805.UAA03272@pubhealth.ku.dk>

   I've compiled R verison 1.3.1 on SGI Irix 6.5

   It fails its check when running the ts-Ex.Rout test with:

=====
>

Error in ar.yw.mts(x, aic = aic, order.max = order.max, na.action =
na.action,  : 
        On entry to DGEMM  parameter number 1 had an illegal value
Execution halted
=====

   It was compiled with gcc 2.95.2 (and the g77 which came with that,
which is 0.5.25).

Subject: [Rd] promax rotation matrix (PR#1146)
Message-ID: <200110261844.UAA03434@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Peter Perkins

Submission from: (NULL) (144.212.95.125)


I believe that line 15 in promax from the mva library is incorrect. It currently
reads
    U <- U %*% xx$rotmat
and I believe it should be 
    U <- xx$rotmat %*% U

I could easily be wrong about this, what with the different definitions of the
rotation matrix vs. its transpose or its inverse.  But as I read the help page,
the rotation returned should be the one right-applied to the unrotated loadings.
 If one gets an unrotated solution from factanal, and then rotates it using
promax, the rotation matrix returned by promax does not rotate the original
loadings to the loadings actually returned by promax.  For example:

> ability.FA <- factanal(factors = 2, covmat = ability.cov, rotation = "none")
> pm <- promax(ability.FA$loadings)
> ability.FA$loadings %*% pm$rotmat

I believe that the latter is correct.  Changing the order of the product in line
15 makes the two the same.

I reported this earlier, and have got reports that others have the same
promlem on UNIX machines, so it is not only a windows problem
S I file a bug report.

The function (boot.stat) given at the end produces a postscript file, 
which cannot be included correctly in LaTeX. Specifically, 
the image in LaTeX (when translated by dvips to postscript)
becomes very small, not using the bounding box, and turned on its head!

Subject: [Rd] warnings --- wish/bug (PR#1148)
Message-ID: <200110261927.VAA03569@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When R prints warnings, they often go "out of the line", it would be
better if they where wrapped with
writeLines(strwrap ...

I tried to do that , changing the function warnings, but it has only
effect when called explicitely, not when R prints the warnings unasked.

Anyhow, here is the changed warnings:

warnings <-
function (...) 
{
    if (!(n <- length(last.warning))) 
        return()
    names <- names(last.warning)
    cat("Warning message", if (n > 1) 
        "s", ":\n", sep = "")
    for (i in 1:n) {
        out <- if (n == 1) 
            names[i]
        else paste(i, ": ", names[i], sep = "")
        if (length(last.warning[[i]])) {
            temp <- deparse(last.warning[[i]])
            out <- paste(out, "in:", temp[1], if (length(temp) > 
                1) 
                " ...")
        }
        writeLines(strwrap(out), ...)
    }
}

This is difficult.  The internal warnings should work as often as
possible without doing memory allocation, which might provoke an error
(*and* we try to print out warnings after a memory allocation error).
So strwrap is a no-no internally.

I've not seen warnings that are not wrapped by the console
(on Unix) or are scrollable (Rgui).   Can you give us an example of the
problem?

Incidentally, I think you want to strwrap the ... too.

That's bad design, but you can scroll the RGui window, surely?

BTW, that's nothing to do with warnings().  The internal code assumes that
the author has used sensible line lengths in the call to warning (R or C)
or warningcall (C).

I tested this. There is definitely something wrong with the
PostScript output. The first command that is called that does
something in the graphics state is 'cl', and this command starts
with a 'grestore'. So, there is a call to 'grestore' in the
PostScipt file that was not preceeded by a call to 'gsave'. The
result is the undoing of a 'gsave' in the embedding code.

I compared the PostScript code to the code that was generated
with another graphic that didn't cause any problemns. Seems that
what is missing in the defective code is a call to 'bp' at the
start. Inserting this command before the first call to 'cl'
fixes the problem.

Why 'bp' is missing is something someone else should figure out.

Thanks for the analysis. For debugging, the following minimal example
may be helpful

b<-
function () 
{
    split.screen(c(1, 2))
    screen(1)
    plot(0)
}
b();postscript();b();dev.off()

notice that it will not happen unless you plot to the screen first.

Subject: [Rd] psignrank and pwilcox null pointer deref (PR#1149)
Message-ID: <200110262150.XAA04192@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Charles J. Geyer
Version: 1.3.1
OS: SuSE 7.2
Submission from: (NULL) (134.84.86.22)


in line 90 of signrank.c and lines 114 and 273 of wilcox.c calloc is used and
the return is not checked to see if it is null (violating numbers 2 and 6 of
the ten commandments for C programmers).  The following code thus makes
R segfault (for suitably large values of 1000)

for (n in seq(100, 1000, 100)) {
   mu <- n * (n + 1) / 4
   sigma <- sqrt(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 24)
   z <- floor(qnorm(0.05, mu, sigma))
   p <- psignrank(z, n)
   cat("z = ", z, ", n = ", n, ", p = ", p, "\n", sep="")
}

for (n in seq(100, 1000, 100)) {
   m <- n
   mu <- n * m / 2
   sigma <- sqrt(m * n * (m + n + 1) / 12)
   z <- floor(qnorm(0.05, mu, sigma))
   p <- pwilcox(z, m, n)
   cat("z = ", z, ", m = ", m, ", n = ", n, ", p = ", p, "\n", sep="")
}

A fix is hard because a good solution would free all the previously allocated
memory before dying.  Probably a better algorithm is needed.  But I don't know
if one exists.

Anyway the current behavior is unacceptable.

The note to 1004 says "fixed for 1.3.1"

Uh.  No.  It ain't.

The problem was more serious than guessed as even the simplest testing
would show.

For example, Example 5.4 in Hollander and Wolfe (Nonparametric Statistical,
Methods, 2nd ed., Wiley, 1999, pp. 180-181)

R Version 1.3.1 (SuSE Linux 7.1)

> X <- read.table(url("http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/5601/hwdata/t5-7.txt"),
+     header = TRUE)
> names(X)
[1] "x" "y"
> attach(X)
> ks.test(x, y)
 
        Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
data:  x and y
D = 0.6, p-value = 0.01234
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

Not hardly.  Hollander and Wolfe say the exact P-value is 0.0524.  Note

> ks.test(x, y, exact = FALSE)
 
        Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
data:  x and y
D = 0.6, p-value = 0.05465
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

Agrees.  Thus the algorithm for the exact null distribution of the two-sample
K-S test statistic is erroneous.  I. e., there is something wrong with the
function "psmirnov2x" in ks.c.  I don't yet know what the problem is.

Here's part of the problem:

Browse[1]> .C("psmirnov2x", p = as.double(STATISTIC), as.integer(n.x),
as.integer(n.y), PACKAGE = "ctest")$p
[1] 0.9876594

as.integer(n.y), PACKAGE = "ctest")$p
[1] 0.9475524
Browse[1]> STATISTIC
[1] 0.6

Perplexed? The reason is of course that

Browse[1]> STATISTIC-0.6
[1] 1.110223e-16

and the KS distribution is discontinuous, so the point probability at
0.6 didn't get counted. Looks like we need a fudge factor.

Subject: [Rd] wilcox.test point estimates perverse (PR#1150)
Message-ID: <200110262309.BAA04442@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The point estimates produced by wilcox.test are perverse (not wrong, just
brain damaged).  The Hodges-Lehmann estimator that goes with the signed
rank test is the median of the Walsh averages.  The Hodges-Lehmann estimator
that goes with the rank sum test is the median of the pairwise differences.

wilcox.test agrees except that it uses the following very peculiar definition
of "sample median": if the number of items is even, the average of the two
middle items (agrees with the usual definition), and if the number of items
is odd, the average of the two on either side of the middle item in sorted
order (huh???  why???).  I know this is asymptotically equivalent to the
usual definition, but

  * Why get answers that disagree with every nonparametrics textbook?

  * If wilcox.test is right then median is wrong and should be fixed
    (just kidding, don't mess with median!)

Thus the complicated code in lines 87--89 of wilcox.test.default
should be replaced by the simple

  ESTIMATE <- median(diffs)

and the complicated code in lines 214-216 of wilcox.test.default should
be again be replaced replaced by the simple

  ESTIMATE <- median(diffs)

Moreover, there is NO "correction for ties" in the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.
Thus the code in lines 147-148 and 272-273 is silly.  The code for the point
estimate should be done by exactly the same code when there are ties or zeroes
(or both) and when there are not.  Reference: Sections 3.2 and 4.2 of
Hollander and Wolfe.

I understand that one doesn't want to produce the vector diffs (which is
order n^2 when n is large), but one doesn't have to to calculate the median
if this is taken to C.

Moreover that uniroot stuff sometimes crashes (sorry, I didn't save the
examples, but take my word for it, it's not bulletproof).

Note that the confidence intervals are also bizarre in the case of ties, but
that's another bug report.

For tied samples this estimators may be not inside the confidence sets which
is confusing. Example (from ?wilcox.exact, package exactRankTests):

> treat <- c(94, 108, 110, 90)
> contr <- c(80, 94, 85, 90, 90, 90, 108, 94, 78, 105, 88)
> 
> # StatXact 4 for Windows: p.value = 0.0989, point prob = 0.019
> 
> wilcox.exact(contr, treat, conf.int=T)

        Exact Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  contr and treat 
W = 9, point prob = 0.019, p-value = 0.0989 
alternative hypothesis: true mu is not equal to 0 
95 percent confidence interval:
 -22   4 
sample estimates:
difference in location 
                    13 		<- when computed with median(diffs)

For compatibility between the 2 versions of the Wilcoxon-Test, 
we use the basic definition: 

  d_1 = sup {d | W(d) > E(W) }
  d_2 = inf {d | W(d) < E(W) }

  Hodges-Lehmann = mean(d1,d2)

(using max and min instead of sup and inf which causes the difference).
However, this may be questionable ...

wilcox.test uses the normal approximation when 

a) the sample sizes are large or
b) ties occur.

computing all differences when a) is not feasible (taking it to C does not
improve `outer(x,y,"-")' significantly). Therefore, we
use uniroot for searching d with W(X - d, Y) = E(W).

In case b) in `wilcox.test' the normal
approximation is used for p-values and confidence intervals, it seems
natural to me to compute the point estimator the way the conf ints are
computed. Additionally median(diffs) may lie outside the confidence set
in this situation (see above).

Because the normal approximation is bizzare for small, tied samples? 
That is what `wilcox.exact' is for.

Hi,
I need to append one vector to another in C. I have this little test
program that crashes is this not what append is for? 

#include<R.h>
#include<Rinternals.h>

SEXP apt(SEXP a, SEXP b){

  SEXP ans;
  PROTECT(ans = append(a,b));
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);

}

Thanks

There is minus sign missing in the formula for cdf of Logistic distribution.

Instead of

should be

Full_Name: Hsiu-Khuern Tang

Hi,

The current documentation for approx() contains the following paragraph:

       f: For `method="constant"' a number between 0 and 1 inclusive,
          indicating a compromise between left- and right-continuous
          step functions. If `y0' and `y1' are the values to the left
          and right of the point then the value is `y0*f+y1*(1-f)' so
          that `f=0' is right-continuous and `f=1' is left-continuous.

The formula

y0*f+y1*(1-f)

should be

y0*(1-f)+y1*f

This will make it consistent with the claim that "`f=0' is right-continuous and
`f=1' is left-continuous", as well as with the actual code:

approx(1:2, 1:2, xout=1.5, method="constant", f=1)
$x
[1] 1.5

$y
[1] 2

Best,
Hsiu-Khuern.

Thank you, Jan.
A "cut&paste" typo I have fixed for "R-devel" (to be 1.4.0).

Well, I don't get either of those:

[1] "2001-12-12 23:40:00" "2001-12-12 23:50:00" "2001-12-13 00:00:00"
[4] "2001-12-13 00:10:00"

It would be helpful to give the incorrect output that your system gives.
In the output below I see no evidence of `the times wrap'.  Using the
wrong day seems to be a bug in glibc's strptime, but you need to unclass
the strptime result to see this.  (I do see the strptime bug on RH6.2
Linux, where the day field is ignored.)

Yes, but that was not the intention in the original (real) example,
where the year was not specified.

Again, the need was to use `time' after the detach.  This only
occurred because you did not remove the variable your system created
incorrectly.

I will change this to work around a system-specific bug.  I'll pass on to
the Windows maintainer fixing the strptime code used on that platform.

No bug.  Here's the clarification:

Contrary to the other implementations of S,
R differentiates different usages of "cex", "col" and "font" :

 > .Pars[grep("^cex",.Pars)]
 [1] "cex"      "cex.axis" "cex.lab"  "cex.main" "cex.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^col",.Pars)]
 [1] "col"      "col.axis" "col.lab"  "col.main" "col.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^font",.Pars)]
 [1] "font"      "font.axis" "font.lab"  "font.main" "font.sub" 

and ?par *does* document this.

Hence the "..." in axis() should really be ``filled'' with cex.axis, etc.

The following is an example demonstrating R's possibilities

plot(1, col.axis = "sky blue", col.lab = "thistle")
title("Main Title", sub = "sub title", 
      cex.main = 2,   font.main= 4, col.main= "blue",
      cex.sub = 0.75, font.sub = 3, col.sub = "red")

I've located the problem, which boils down to inaccuracies in the
following in man strptime:

       The  GNU  libc  implementation does not touch those fields
       which are not directly initialized.   Exceptions  are  the
       tm_wday  and  tm_yday elements which are recomputed if any
       of the year, month, or date elements changed.

As RMH's example shows, it does touch the tm_mon and tm_mday fields if the
year is specified (even if unchanged) but not quite always.

I am writing a workaround for R-devel.  Yet another system-specific
problem with the date-time code!

       Hi,
       The function help.start() assume that the brower is netscape
which is no longer the dominant brower in used. I am using now opera
and other use mozilla or Microsoft IE. I can always type
help.start(browser="opera"), but it is not convenience: I would like
to be able to set the default brwsernone for all. But the real bug is
that even after launching help.start(browser="opera"), other help
commands, help(help), say, still send the "help page" to netscape. Here
is what I get

> help.start(browser="opera")
If opera  is already running,   it is *not* restarted,
 and you must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient..
> help(help)          
help() for help  is shown in browser netscape ...
Use      help( help , htmlhelp=FALSE)
or       options(htmlhelp = FALSE)
to revert.
> sh: netscape: command not found

Please correct this bug.

On what operating system is this?  On Unix/Linux you should be using
options(browser="opera").  On Windows/Mac you can't set the browser
anyway.

See the requirements for a browser in the details under ?help.start.
Neither of those (nor Netscape 6.1) worked when I tried them with -remote.

I don't think it is a bug in R but I have expanded the documentation.

Please do use the bug.report() function, as critical information is
missing from this report.

I am sorry not having looked carefully on the documentation. But the
first thing I do is to launch help.start() and be stuck with an
inexistent browser. I have imagined that help.start(browser="opera")
would set the browser to opera, but I am wrong and the browser must be
set by options(browser="opera"), a feature which I am not aware of.
Nevertheless, I find this rather confusing for a new user: if
options(browser="opera") should always be used to set the browser,
then the argument browser="opera" in help.start would never be needed.

The documentation issue may be unfortunate, but there is really no point
unless we find browsers other than Netscape which can be controlled
remotely.  I have been raising this issue a couple of times, last time
about three months ago or so.  Mozilla then claimed to support -remote
as Netscape does but really did not.  Konqueror does not allow being
sent URLs remotely, and neither does gnome-help-browser.  Not sure about
Opera ... do you have more info?

Subject: [Rd] strptime bug (PR#1155)
Message-ID: <200110312232.XAA20303@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Where is the strptime bug happening?  I am seeing it on W95 W98 W2000
running Rterm under ntemacs 21.1 with ESS 5.1.19 and using cygwin
2001/08/31 15:52:16 Starting cygwin install, version 2.78.2.3

Is strptime using the bash from my system? or is it using functions
that are included with R?

R defaulted to 1900 when I didn't specify a year.  The 1990 came from
the help(beav1).

When I explicitly place a year in the file, either the 1990 inidcated
in the help(beav1) file or the 1900 chosen to match the default, then
R gives me times consistent with the input.

help(lm)

says that

  An object of class `"lm"' is a list containing at least the
     following components:

  ...

  formula: the formula supplied.


But is the "formula" component necessarily present?

An example:

Nicely spotted. Yes, it's present:

> formula(temp)
y ~ x

However, it is part of the terms (and model) component, not a
component in itself (str(temp) to see it) so should probably not be
documented as such.

Message-ID: <200110011343.PAA16182@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi everyone,
  I have just tried to compile R 1.3.1 on the following platform:

R is now configured for mips-sgi-irix6.5

  Source directory:          .
  Installation directory:    /usr/local
  C compiler:                gcc  -g -O2
  C++ compiler:              g++  -g -O2
  FORTRAN compiler:          g77  -g -O2

  X11 support:               yes
  Gnome support:             no
  Tcl/Tk support:            no

  R profiling support:       yes
  R as a shared library:     no

and came up with the following error:

making Lapack.d from Lapack.c
        gcc -I. -I../../../src/include -I../../../src/include -I/usr/local/include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -fPIC  -g -O2 -c Lapack.c -o Lapack.lo

        g77  -fPIC  -g -O2 -c cmplx.f -o cmplx.lo
don't know how to make # (bu42).
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

What is "bu42" and or error code "bu21"? And how do I get R to compile?
Thanks,
Patrick.

Subject: [Rd] problem with strptime example (PR#811)
Message-ID: <200110011358.PAA16380@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hello,

strptime is still not working correctly in my computer 
(Windows 98 and R Version 1.3.1)  

From

x <- c("1jan1960", "2jan1960", "31mar1960", "30jul1960")
strptime(x, "%d%b%Y")

I obtain

[1] "NA" "NA" "NA" "NA"

while 
x <- c("01011960", "02011960", "3131960", "3071960")
strptime(x, "%d%m%Y")

gives 
[1] "1960-01-01" "1960-01-02" "1960-03-31" "1960-07-30"

So it seems that the problem is with %b.

Highly system-dependent codes, I'd guess. Are you using GNU make?

This is working as documented, i.e. correctly.

Do read all the example, which contains an explanation and workaround
(which does not work on all systems and hence is in the comments).

In your locale `jan' is not the abbreviation for January, I believe.

This works fine for me on a similar setup. Does Finnish localisation
do strange things with month names??

Be careful!  Both gnudoit and gnuclient could be used, depending on

well, the current code has a hard-coded "gnudoit", so what Thomas
reported was clearly a docu bug, which I fixed. If we want to support
gnuclient in addition to gnudoit that would be a new feature ... when
is which used?

Subject: [Rd] calling browser in Windows
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110021342140.30794-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  I'm working on the interface to LiveGraphics3D (Java applet for dynamic
3D graphics) that I mentioned earlier on the list, and I've hit a
cross-platform problem.
  I want to allow the option of popping up a browser or opening the file
in a browser automatically.  On Unix, the following (stolen from
help.start()) works:

system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null || ",
               browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))

If I want to do this in Windows, options("browser") is NULL.  (For now I'm
hardcoding browser to "C:/PROGRA~1/INTERN~1/IEXPLORE.EXE", but this
clearly isn't a general solution.) The syntax of the call is also
different (IE at least appears to require just the file name, "file:/"
just seems to confuse it).  I don't know how to start a browser in the
background, or do the equivalent of -remote ...  help.start() is
considerably more internalized on Windows, so I'm not getting much useful
there.

  Here's what I'm doing now:

  mach <- machine()
  if (mach=="Unix") {
    url <- paste("file:",file.path(getwd(),fn),sep="")
    system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null ||
",
                 browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))
  }
  else if (mach=="Windows") {
    system(paste(browser,file.path(getwd(),fn)))
  }
}


  Is there a different idiom I should be using for Windows?
  I suppose it's all completely different for the Mac too ...
  Might it be possible to standardize this interface?

 thanks,
  Ben Bolker

After some investigations:
In plotmath.c, line 2250 the "the gap between the nucleus and the
radical extension" is defined:
 #define RADICAL_GAP    0.4

It looks like this gap is not added to the hight (or included in the
calculations of the hight) of the denominator of a fraction. So the
whole denominator is located to close to the fraction bar, if a root is
drawn.
I don't see, how this can be fixed smartly ...

Subject: [Rd] tiny typo in optim/N-M documentation (PR#1109)
Message-ID: <200110031509.RAA09208@pubhealth.ku.dk>


In the optim() documentation,  the control parameter "maxit" says
"There is no other stopping criteria."  That should be "are", or
"criterion" ...

While I'm at it -- poking at the code a little bit, it looks as if the
initial simplex is set from the initial point by displacing each
parameter value by max(0.1,0.1*pmax(fabs(Bvec))), where Bvec is the
initial parameter set.  It would be nice to have a bit more external
control of this procedure.
  Is anyone interested in hacking this?  If I did it myself would
anyone be interested in the results?  Or does fussing with the
Nelder-Mead simplex seem silly because anyone who is really serious
about optimization will being using another method anyway?

Subject: [Rd] Several R vs S-Plus issues (PR#1110)
Message-ID: <200110031539.RAA09399@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi, all,

   I've been converting code from S-Plus ("S" for short) to R for a few weeks.
Here are some differences I've found, aside from the big well-known ones
(scoping, models, data storage) and the contents of Kurt Hornik's FAQ section
3.3.3.  Let me start with the ones that seem like serious bugs or deficiencies:

1) LETTERS[c(NA,2)] in S is c("","B"), but in R is c("NA","B").

  This is TERRIBLE!  I have a ton of S-Plus code that looks like:
     y$ticker <- z$ticker[match(y$cusip, z$cusip)]
  and I count on a ticker of "" to indicate failed lookups.  Not only will
  I need to change all that code, but I'll never be able to trade Nabisco
  (ticker NA) again.  PLEASE re-consider this choice, or at least make it
  an option: option(na.char="").


2) system() has no "input" argument in R.

   Here's a (Unix) example:
   S> system("cd mydir; latex myfile", input="x")
     which goes to the directory where myfile lives and LaTeX's it, passing
     an "x" through STDIN in case LaTeX encounters an error.  My R fix is:
   R> system("cd mydir; echo x | latex myfile")
   Note that it's not as simple as  cmd <- paste("echo",input,"|",cmd).


3) R> myfun <- function(x, ...) {x[...] <- 0;  x}
   R> myfun(3)
   Error in myfun(3) : SubAssignArgs: invalid number of arguments

   It failed because no ... was given.  Fortunately, this is easily patched:
   R> myfun <- function(x, ...) {if (missing(...)) x[]<-0 else x[...]<-0; x}


4) Missing functions:
   a) identical() [scheduled for 1.4.0]
   b) slice.index()
   c) rowSums(), colSums(), colVars(), etc.
   d) unpaste() - R has strsplit, whose result is like the transpose of unpaste


5) rowsum() gives character dimnames in S, factor numbers in R.
   I've reported this early, and Brian D. Ripley promised a fix in 1.4.0.


OK, the rest are just differences, not complaints.  In fact, sometimes they are
very good differences.

1) Same argument given twice produces an error in R; S takes the last one.
   S> mean(x=4, x=5)    # Returns 5
   R> mean(x=4, x=5)    # Error

2) row.names(y) <- LETTERS[1:3] coerces list to dataframe in S, is error in R.

3) Default "what" for scan in S is "", in R is double(0).

4) Default "quote" for scan is "'\"" in R, causes different behavior than S.

5) which(<numeric>) converts to logical in S, is an error in R.

6) The NULL returned by if(F){...} is invisible in R, visible in S.

7) The NULL returned by return() is visible in R, invisible in S.

8) Args to "var" differ, and R has "cov".  S na.method="a" is like R use="p".

9) var (or cov) drops dimensions in S, not R.

10) cut allows labels=F in R, not in S (also left.include=T becomes right=F).

11) substring(s,"x") <- "X" only works in S, but R has s <- gsub("x","X",s).

12) S function casefold() replaced in R by toupper() or tolower().

13) Functions missing from S: sub(), gsub(), chartr(), toupper(), tolower()

14) Log scale indicated in S with par(xaxt)=="l", in R with par("xlog")==T.

?summary.lm

refers under "Value:" to something called "lm.obj".  Shouldn't that be
"object"?


Similarly

?summary.glm

refers under "Arguments:dispersion:", and again under "See also:", to something
called "glm.obj", which again looks like it ought to be "object" or "x"?


Apologies for reporting two at once, but these seem to be so similar as to be
best taken together.

Apologies also if I am missing some convention which makes these not errors.

Also in assign() there some arguments lacking in R such as 'frame' and

None of the web page on bug tracking, the ?bug.report help page,

 - that only one bug should go in each report
 - that it's a good idea to discuss things on r-devel if you're not sure
something
is a bug.

I'd add this to the bug.report disclaimer:

"If you are not sure if what you see is a bug, please discuss it on the r-devel

mailing list first.  If you are sure, please copy the bug report 
(after finishing it) to your favorite email program and send it to

The other places could have more verbose versions of this advice, including 
advice not to cc it to other lists.

I think we do not want to change this.

Splus has

> (1:2)[c(NA,2)]
[1] NA  2
> is.na((1:2)[c(NA,2)])
[1] T F
> is.na(c(TRUE, FALSE)[c(NA,2)])
[1] T F

etc, so I think the logic would be that we get NA whenever we subscript
by NA.  The current Splus behavior for character vectors is different,
and I do not see why it should.  Note that in R,

R> is.na(LETTERS[c(NA,2)])
[1]  TRUE FALSE

so we really have NA but it is printed as "NA" (and this might be
another case where <NA> would be better).

Doug Bates had raised this issue some time ago.  In the interest of
keeping the S language core as small as possible, I'd rather recommend
against adding these.  We can basically do that same using apply(), and
if the point is to have fast C code I think we should rather
special-case apply accordingly.

This is a function from the chron package, and it is also available in
the R version of chron.  Again, I am not sure whether this should be in
the S language core: we have strsplit.

I am a happy (but serious) user of simplex optimisation in "optim".  I
think that it would be a very good idea to be able to over-ride the
default initial simplex through an argument to the "control" list.  So
if you do the hack please publish it, and if not, let me know and I will
have a go instead.

You have 900 columns and only 270 rows, hence you should have a
vertical rectangle that is approx. 3 times as wide as high.

The difference to calling image() on a matrix is deliberate: if you
store a picture as a matrix (as usual), then you'd expect element 1,1
of that matrix to correspond to the upper left corner. That is
different from what image() does, because it was designed for doing
the right thing for matrices produced by, e.g., outer() ... [at least
I think that's the reason for image() rotating the matrix].

Best,
Fritz

I agree with the point that the upper left corner must be the
1,1 cell in the matrix for a "natural" display of the matrix
as an image. But this does not mean that the matrix should be rotated.
In all image processing packages that I know of, an image with
200 cols and 100 rows is displayed as a horizontal rectangle. Note
that, if there is geometric correction to a geographic projection,
the columns go W to E as left to right and the rows N to S as
top to bottom. In fact,
the "natural" display should follow the same geometry than print,
i.e.,

> matrix(1:12,ncol=6,nrow=2)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9   11
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10   12
> 

should be displayed as a horizontal rectangle.

Of course you can do it as you want because this is your package,
but are you sure that you want it the way it is?

Agus

Fixed now for r-devel. Will commit shortly.

(Martin, here's a way to test all characters:

 x <- y <- unlist(as.list(
   parse(text=paste("\"\\",
         as.character(structure(0:255,class="octmode")),
         "\"",sep=""))))
 save(x, ascii=T, file="here")
 load("here")
 all(x==y)

- I'd commit it for the regression test suite, but I'm not sure what
our conventions are for temporary files)

BTW: printing and deparsing x and y causes display corruption. Perhaps
we should have an isprint somewhere?

Hi!

The function get.hist.quote in the package tseries (Version 0.7-6) does not work
in 
my computer. 
I found that it uses the function strptime which did not "understand" English
month
names in my Finnish locale (see bug report 811). I changed the regional settings
to 
be English (UK) and strptime started to work as I liked. However, get.hist.quote
does 
not work yet, since the function julian does not work. Is this problem only in
my computer? The previous version of get.hist.quote (tseries 0.7-0) did work.

Sys.time and julian produce

I think NA and "NA" are treated in a very confusing way in R.  In y
below, I construct an NA the way you did above; in z, I use the string
'NA'.  As far as I can tell the vectors are identical.  In w, I use
paste(NA), and get something different.  I also tried paste('NA'), and
get something that looks like w.

Doug was responding to a request from a poster at fmr.com (I believe
it was David in fact) for the colSums function.  I showed how an add-on
package with this function could be created.  I'm sure that all these
functions could be added easily in a separate package.  

Perhaps I was overly subtle in my phrasing but I wrote the message on
how to create a package so as to encourage others to add these
functions instead of relying on a member of the core group having the
time and inclination to do so.

I agree with Kurt that we would want to have a strong reason for
adding these functions to the base language.  Kurt has actively
promoted the idea of basing R on a small, tight language core that is
supplemented by packages.  Toward this end Kurt has done an incredible
amount of work on tools for package attachment, checking, and
documentation.

The goal of a small tight language core supplemented by
user-contributed modules is in keeping with the spirit of open source
projects.  The R core team, especially Kurt and Fritz, devote
considerable effort to creating tools to make it easy for others to
contribute their work.  A commercial developer is more inclined to
define the language and capabilities in house where they have control
and where they can provide support.  This is not a criticism of
commercial development.  If you are required to provide support for
the software you must be able to control the code.

Those on the r-devel list may want to check the web site
                   http://developer.r-project.org/
occasionally.  Some plans for the future and items for discussion are
given there.

Excactly, I agree with everything you say!

you mean it doesn't do that? which version of pixmap, which version of
R on which platform?

Using 

R> x <- matrix(1:12,ncol=6,nrow=2)
R> library(pixmap)
R> plot(as.pixmap(x))

I get the attached picture, which is what you want, no?

Best,

Hello, R-devel!

I posted to R-help, and (inappropriately) to R-bugs, this R/S-Plus difference:
> LETTERS[c(NA,2)] in S is c("","B"), but in R is c("NA","B")

Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at> wrote:

This is merely a statement about is.na(), namely that it flags the string
"NA".  There is no distinction in R between the "NA" that arises from
subsetting with a missing value, and the "NA" that represents Nabisco.  Note:
  R> all.equal(LETTERS[c(NA,2)][1], substring("NABISCO",1,2))
  [1] TRUE

R thinks I am missing data when I trade Nabisco, in the Netherlands/Antilles,
or through trader Neil Armstrong.  In each case, "" would more likely indicate
a missing value; there is no stock with that ticker, country with that symbol,
or trader with those initials.

I'd think it would be easy to make is.na() flag "" instead of "NA".  However,
I'm stuck at the definition:
  R> is.na
  .Primitive("is.na")
so I don't know how to change it (I'm a lousy developer, you see).

I propose again that we provide options(na.char="NA"), so users can make their
own choice.  Thanks for listening!

Other's have been on the warpath re. this issue lately (and it's been
an annoyance for years - NorAdrenalin, Nitric Acid, etc.). It's not
unlikely to find a solution for 1.4, but probably not the one you are
proposing. Basically, we should have a *real* NA for string variables,
distinct from the character string "NA" and propagating like any other
NA's.

Inserting a value to substitute for missing could be handled
differently, e.g. via

replace.na <- function(x,r){x[is.na(x)]<-r; x}

I think we do want to change this (as we discussed quite recently) but by
adding a genuine character NA.  The problem is not that LETTERS[c(NA,2)]
returns a missing value, it's that it isn't missing enough. We need a
"NaS" (Not a String) value that can't be confused with Nabisco, but also
can't be confused with an empty string.

I could go for that.  How would it appear when cat()ed or print()ed?

Agreed.  As Peter said, subscripting by NA should give NA but R cannot
distinguish a string NA from the string NA.  However, David (I think)
was suggesting that subscripting a string with NA should give an empty
string, which I think cannot be right.  It must be NaS in your sense.

I think <NA> to distinguish from "NA".

R 1.4.0 already has

    o   Printing factors with both level "NA" and missing values
        uses `<NA>' for the missing values to distinguish them.

I am confused by the subject: above you indicate that get.hist.quote
does not work because julian does not work.

What precisely are your locale settings?

But it does make some sort of distinction, as my example contrasting
"NA" with paste(NA) shows.  In case you missed it:

Yes.  is.na() of a string is true if that string is actually a reference
to R_NaString.  Parsing a literal "NA" will give R_NaString, as will
coercing NA from some other type.  However, paste() doesn't check whether
it produces "NA". Neither does toupper()
  > is.na(toupper("na"))
  [1] FALSE
  > toupper("na")
  [1] "NA"


So we're partway there already, in fact.  It looks like we basically
need to
1) stop the parser generating R_NaString from \"NA\"
2) Change PRINTNAME(R_NaString) to avoid ambiguity

One more (at least :-))

3) fix saveload.c to preserve NA status in strings.

Right now we have

> x<-as.character(list(NA, "NA", paste(NA)))
> x
[1] "NA" "NA" "NA"
> is.na(x)
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> save(list="x", file="tmp.RData")
> load("tmp.RData")
> x
[1] "NA" "NA" "NA"
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE

It's easy enough to fix in principle--just add another case to
NewSaveSpecialHook and NewLoadSpecialHook.  Unfortunately this means
workspace files that contain string NA's written with this new
convention won't be readable by older versions of R (I think it will
generate an "unknown type" error) (and probably leave the file
opened).

Subject: [Rd] library(..., pos=4)
Message-ID: <200110042110.f94LAW627097@arbres1a.FMR.Com>

Hello again, r-devel,

   I propose adding a "pos" argument to library(), so that one can attach the
library in a position other than 2.  It seems straightforward, just 2 changes:

1) pos=2  at the end of the argument list,
2) env <- attach(NULL, pos, name=pkgname)  in line 22

Indeed the authors seem to have anticipated this by defining "lib.pos" further
on, rather than hard-coding it as 2.

   Please let me know (gently) if I have not described my request properly...

Submission from: (NULL) (140.107.26.74)


I noticed while reading some of the html documentation (e.g. R-intro.html) that
many of the internal links in the documents were broken.  At least they don't
work in Mozilla 0.9.3.  This is because the strings for the internal references
include %20 rather than just spaces.  This could easily be fixed with a perl
script to replace all instances of %20 with ' '.

I tried this on R-intro.html and it worked.

Spaces in links are *supposed* to be coded as %20, becauses
spaces are not allowed in URLs, including internal links. At
least, with some versions of Netscape, links with spaces don't
work.

ok, found the pronlem: my fault.
I was using v.0.1. With Version: 0.2-1
it's ok. 

I observe that you stretch lineraly now within
pixmap. The problem is that you use the max
of all 3 bands, which is not normally good.
Also an optional "normal" stretching should
provide better results in most cases. I'll 
send you the code and an attached example
(only to Friedrich.Leisch@ci.tuwien.ac.at to avoid
annoying other people) in a while.

the NEWS file in  1.4.0-devel states: 

o   mean() has `data frame' method applying mean column-by-column.
    When applied to non-numeric data mean() now returns NA rather

which means: 

R> mean(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] NA
Warning message: 
argument is not numeric: returning NA in: mean.default(c(TRUE, FALSE)) 

but: 

R> sum(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] 1

?sum states: 

     sum(..., na.rm=FALSE)

Arguments:

     ...: numeric vectors.

and clearly

R> is.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] FALSE


this is confusing, isn't it? I think that `sum' and `mean' should take the
same arguments (and one probably will not allow to sum up logicals) or am
I missing something?

Hmm. That slipped in without me noticing. Summing logicals is a fairly
common practice, as in 

sem <- sd(x,na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))

Taking means of logicals is somewhat more rare, but it does work in
Splus 6.0 and it is a general rule coerce to logicals to 0/1, so I
suspect that this is just an oversight and we want mean.default to
start with

    if (!is.numeric(x) && !is.complex(x) && !is.logical(x)) {
        warning("argument is not numeric: returning NA")
        return(as.numeric(NA))

If Brian really meant otherwise, he'll explain why when he gets back
from Switzerland...

I think this is what you are interested in:

   R (1.3.1) appears to have a bug (well a mis-feature, I suppose).

   It places architecture-specific and architecture-dependent files in
the same locations.  This means that the common files cannot be shared
across installations on multiple architectures.

   It would be nice if it could separate these under exec_prefix and
prefix and look in the relevant one for each file.

Back-compatibility.  In data frames logicals used to get coerced to
two-level factors, not to numerics, and then mean would fail for them.
If a logical is an experimental factor, sums make sense but means do not.

Here is what I find confusing (1.3.1).

> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
> mean(x)
[1] 0.5
> DF <- data.frame(x = x)
> mean(DF$x)
Error in Summary.factor(..., na.rm = na.rm) :
        "sum" not meaningful for factors

There 1.4.0 is consistent.

Change it if you like, but do think through all the implications of the
inconsistent treatment of logicals (for which I have not had time as yet).

What would be `nice' about it? There are `architecture-specific' (also
known as `architecture-dependent', sic) files all over the place in R.
There are few files that are not platform-dependent: for example many of
the help files and the base R code file are.  Many of these are not
executables and do not belong under `exec_prefix'.

This cannot be a space issue this century (as it was originally I believe),
as surely you can afford the disc space for copies of R for each of a
sensible number of platforms?

Suppose one did combine the trees for i386-linux and ppc-linux.  What do
you think would happen when i386-linux is upgraded and ppc-linux is not?
And R is designed to be upgraded on the fly, using update.packages().  We
have public R installations for sparc-solaris, i386-linux and Windows and
sharing them for R would be a nightmare for the administrators.  (We do
share them for TeX, for example.)

I changed the title, because this is not about browser() but about HTML
viewers, and the problem is on Unix not Windows.

I think it's a within-Unix-platform problem, mainly.  The other two ports
have a simple procedure: it's Unix/Linux where the problems arise.

And last time we tested this that only works if the browser is netscape
4.7x, so the freedom is illusory.

Look at help, just as you should for Unix.

?shell.exec

(A better way to say this is that is completely different under Unix, but
Mac and Windows are similar.)

Yes, one might be able to persuade the Unix world to agree on one ....
What help() does does not even work with Netscape 6.01 (and I have yet to
try it with 6.1).

Actually, only the deparsing of the expression is wrong, cf:

> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]]
exp(-x - xmid/scal)
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]]
-x - xmid/scal
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]][[2]]
-x - xmid
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]][[2]][[2]]
x - xmid

I.e. the expression is really exp((-(x - xmid))/scal). It is a
well-known problem with the deparser that it doesn't parenthesize
properly based on operator hierarchy. Similarly, the parser should
probably drop parentheses in most cases.

r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk

Hi,

I have found something I guess is a bug in write.table.  When saving
the object "e2" (see the session transcription below, I have attached
the Rdata file in gzipped form), the resulting table (also attached)
contains a spurious space in the front of columns from starting the
column "c05ak01" (column 234).

This would not be a problem, but if the object is large (the original
database contained not 10 but 7000 observations), some of the colums
are missing at all.  The problem is similar when you use quote=FALSE
option.

Best wishes

Message-ID: <3BC1D795.A8F6E86D@umsanet.edu.bo>

Hola!

I have problems running Rcmd check (windows 98, R1.3.0)

It ckoks on an example running a function which calla bringToTop().
This makes an error because Rcmd check runs the examples with the
postscript device, and bringToTop does not make sense with that device.

Howevere, my function is for interactive use, and needs bringToTop. 
How can this be used in examples and still have the possibility to use
the automatic
error checking? I also used par(ask=TRUE) and identify in
examples, but gac
ve up on that. But there is a general problem that the automatic running 
of example code chocks on code which make sense interactively, 
but not in batch mode. How can this be solved?

Also, it would be nice if the control of exampkles would not stop
on the first error, but control with further examples, to find all
errors in one run.

Use \dontrun{} as described in the  R-exts  manual.

You might want to change the following lines in the perl script "check"
in R's bin directory:

  if(Rsystem($cmd)) {
    $log->error("running examples failed");
    exit(1);
  }

Is this a bug?

 1 NA 
 1  3 

It has some annoying consequences, e.g.

> median( matrix(1:9,nc=3,dimnames=list(1:3,1:3))[1,,drop=F] )
NA 
 4

The above was for 

Version:
 platform = sparc-sun-solaris2.7
 arch = sparc
 os = solaris2.7
 system = sparc, solaris2.7
 status = 
 major = 1
 minor = 3.0
 year = 2001
 month = 06
 day = 22
 language = R


The behavior seems to differ slightly in 1.3.1.

On Windows 1.3.1  

 matrix(1:9,nc=3,dimnames=list(1:3,1:3))[ cbind(1:3,1:3) ]

omits the names (as is my preference).

Perhaps a clearer example is

> a[1]
A
1

B
2

It's at least a wart that you sometimes get the row names and sometimes
NA.  OTOH it's not clear what the names of a vector extracted from a
matrix *should* be if the vector isn't a single row or column.

Use interactive() in your code to not use code that only makes sense
interactively.

You can set options(error) to do that.

Message-ID: <3BC2A1BB.7E2FE27B@durham.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

I know that Kurt is thinking about slimming down the core functions of R
and putting more stuff into libraries.  I was wondering if, as a first
step, thought had been given to re-organising the source code to
separate out the S-language functionality from the base package
functions. I am thinking in particular of the subdirectory src/main
which contains both top-level files such as "memory.c" and base-package
files such as "optim.c".  Would it not be clearer to mount the base
package entirely on src/library and so put the required C files into the
subdirectory src/library/base/src (which currently does not exist)?

Cheers, Jonathan.

Not really.  If base remains a package, then base.so would have always to
be loaded, and no reduction would result.  Also optim() etc are
implemented via .Internal, and at present .Internal functions (and
primitives) are determined by a compiled-in table.  So the net result
would a lot of work, slower loading and probably a net increase in the
size of the running image.

It seems to me that slimming-down will only work (well) once we can split
base into a number of sub-packages which are auto-loaded as needed (not
necessarily by the autoload mechanism), and namespaces will be useful when
going along that route.   Most of the space we could save is R code, not
compiled C code.   I introduced modules to save much of the latter.

Brian

Hmm. This is a consequence of

> x[[2]]<- letters[1:2]
Error: more elements supplied than there are to replace

which S-PLUS does differently. However, I'm not sure we really want
this to change for the following reason:

> x<-NULL
> x[[2]]<- letters[1:2]
> x
$"":
NULL

$value:
[1] "a" "b"

> x<-NULL
> x[[2]]<-"1"
> x
[1] ""  "1"

Now what does this do if the array extent has length 1?

>  x <- matrix(1:2,2)
>  dimnames(X)[[2]] <- "a"
Problem in dimnames(X) <- .A0: Component 2 of dimnames has length 1, should be 2

Phillipe,

As Thomas noted, R does not currently allow testing whether a function is
being debugged.  However, it is possible to add this feature.  I'm attaching
a patch to the end of this message that adds a new internal function
"isdebug" which tests if its (only) argument is a function with debugging
enabled.

It can be used by:

	> f <- function() 1
	> isdebug(f)
	[1] FALSE
	> debug(f)
	> isdebug(f)
	[1] TRUE	

Using this, it is simple construct a function that gets a list of current
objects and uses isdebug to determine which are functions with debugging
enabled:

	> listdebug <- function(envir=globalenv())
	+   {
	+     test <- function(x) 
	+       { 
	+         fun <- get(x)
	+         if(is.function(fun))
	+           return( isdebug(x) )
	+         else
	+           return(FALSE)
	+       }
	+ 
	+     fnames <- objects(envir=envir)
	+     flag <- sapply(fnames, test)
	+     if(length(flag)>0)
	+       fnames[flag]
	+     else
	+       NULL
	+   }
	> 
	> x <- 7
	> y <- 8
	> f <- function() 1
	> g <- function() 2
	> 
	> debug(f)
	> 
	> ls()
	[1] "f"         "g"         "listdebug" "test"      "x"         "y"

	> 
	> listdebug()
	[1] "f"
	> 
	>

I think there is a problem when computing Pearson residuals, in that they seem
to be computed at the raw residuals divided by the square root of the
corresponding diagonal element of the weight matrix W evaluated at the last step
of the iterative model fitting procedure (IWLS), instead of dividing by the
square root of the model variance. Here's an example of the weird effects it
produces:

> me <- c(1:100)/2
> y <- rpois(100,me)
> yglm <- glm(y~me-1, family=poisson(link="identity"))
> plot(fitted(yglm), residuals(yglm,type="response"))
 
plots the raw residuals... but
 
> plot(fitted(yglm), residuals(yglm,type="pearson"))
 
plots the raw residuals MULTIPLIED by sqrt(fitted(yglm))... because it
computes the Pearson residuals dividing by the square root of the diagonal
element of the weight matrix W (at the end of the iterative fitting process)
rather than dividing by the sqrt of variance.

Um, right... At the very least, there's a "/" that should have been
"*". But do we also divide by the dispersion (when it is estimated)? I
forget what the definition says.

I don't think we do divide by the dispersion -- all the flavours of
residual are supposed to be the same for the normal/identity case.

Subject: [Rd] Wrong df in bartlett.test when subsetting data (PR#1124)
Message-ID: <200110101543.RAA01459@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jens Lund
Version: 1.3.1
OS: Windows
Submission from: (NULL) (194.239.194.210)


When we subset a dataset bartlett.test does not calculate the df correctly:

X <- rnorm(50)     # Generate simulated samples
f <- gl(10,5)      # Generate a factor with 10 levels and
                   # 5 replications of each level

# Works correctly
bartlett.test(X,f) # Correct number of df = 9

# Just use the first 5 levels of f
# Does not work correctly
bartlett.test(X[1:25],f[1:25]) # Should have df = 4, but uses df = 9
bartlett.test(X~f,subset=1:25) # Should have df = 4, but uses df = 9

In version 1.2.2 the problem could be solved by substituting
        k <- nlevels(g)
with    k <- length(unique(g))
(I do not get the R-code in the new version get by typing bartlett.test at the
prompt.)

This might leed to a discussion on whether nlevels should return the number of
attained factor levels or the number of "theoretical" levels:
nlevels(f)       # Returns 10, fine!
nlevels(f[1:25]) # Returns 10, might not be fine; 5 might be the correct
answer.
The same question might be asked for levels, levels(f) versus levels(f[1:25]).
At least the documentation should be clear on this point, which I do not think
it is now. (Perhaps the levels attribute on the factor should be changed for a
subset of the data, but this is probably not an efficient way of doing
things...)

A similar problem also comes up with interactions between factors in unbalanced
designs:
g <- gl(2,40,50)
nlevels(f:g)         # Returns 20
length(unique(f:g))  # Returns 10
table(f,g)           # See the design

This bug has also been seen on version 1.2.2 on Linux, but is reproduced for
this bug report on:

I strongly believe that levels() and nlevels() are doing the right thing
here.  If a variable is a factor with two levels (eg Male & Female) then
it shouldn't stop being a factor with two levels just because you have a
small sample.  In particular, when you have a single observation g[i] it
is still important to know the set of levels it comes from, rather than
just the category it is in.

On http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk/cgi-bin/R pressing "new bug report" returns a new
form. It would, IMHO, be natural to place the "submit bug report" button on this
form *below* the input area for the actual bug report :-)

This is a documented feature: more accurately, newlines matter.  An R
statement is terminated if it is syntactically complete at the end of the
line.

See the reference manual section 10.2.5 for an explicit statement.

Which is listed as Thomas' doing, but I suspect it was discussed
internally, and thus a collective piece of absentmindedness.

What we have in glm.fit is

w <- sqrt((weights[good] * mu.eta.val[good]^2)/variance(mu)[good])

which later gets squared before it is returned, so the weights are
essentially 

mu.eta.val^2/variance(mu) 

which is what you are saying since the link derivatives are the
"backwards" d(mu)/d(eta). The thing that is confusing is that for a
loglinear Poisson model this comes out as mu^2/mu = mu. AFAIR, similar
cancellation happens in all canonical GLIMs.

For the identity link, it comes out as 1/mu, which is why it seemingly
worked to switch from divide to multiply....

(And of course in ordinary weighted regression, the weights *are* 
usually the reciprocal variances.)

Cc'ed to r-bugs, hoping that someone with a clear mind will do the
right thing...

Yes, in response to a previous bug report (?Atkinson) pointing out that
the old version was wrong when the link function was monotone decreasing
(Gamma/reciprocal).  It wasn't a confusion of * and /, it was a deeper
absentmindedness.

We can't just use $weights, although it does work for canonical links. We
need (y-mu)/sqrt(prior.weights*variance(mu))

Subject: [Rd] unary "-" doesn't convert logicals (PR#1127)
Message-ID: <200110112212.AAA14833@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: John M. Heumann
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Windows NT4/SP5
Submission from: (NULL) (192.25.140.108)


If unary "-" is applied to a logical vector, the resulting value
is computed correctly (i.e. coerced to a numeric), but the type
(incorrectly) remains logical: 

> x <- 1:10
> p1 <- (x > 5)
> p2 <- (-p1)
> is.logical(p2)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(p2)
[1] FALSE
> as.numeric(p1)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
> as.numeric(p2)
 [1]  0  0  0  0  0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Since "==" always does binary comparison, this can lead to
some bizarre behavior:

> p1
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> p2
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> (p1 == p2)
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
((!p1) == (!p2))
 [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

It was not a problem because 1.3.1 gave the wrong answer!  In 1.3.1 on a
postscript device, the background was not painted if white (the default),
but col=0 did paint white.  So the background colour was really
transparent, but col=0 was white.

In 1.4.0 white and transparent are distinct, and you can now set
transparent via an inline `col' setting.  (It was only allowed for direct
setting by par when you made the report.)

The issue was not col=0, but the colour that corresponded to.  Plotting in
col=0 is a lot less useful now, since it often does nothing.

Yup, that's a bug.

I wonder how long it has been around. The function definition is

> get("names<-.dist")
function (d, n) 
{
    if (length(n) != attr(d, "Size")) 
        stop("invalid names for dist object")
    attr(d, "Labels") <- n
    d
}

but the value is passed as a named argument called "value", and it has
been like that for ages.  The fix is obvious: replace "n" with "value"

Subject: [Rd] MASS: isoMDS and sammon
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0110122336360.560-100000@kleigh.nl>


If tbl is an object of class 'dist', you can do this:

    a <- sammon(tbl, k=3)


But you can't do this:

    b <- isoMDS(tbl, k=3)


Wouldn't it be sensible to have identical interfaces to sammon()
and isoMDS() ?

I think all that would be needed is to change this:

  isoMDS <- function(d, y=cmdscale(d, 2), maxit=50, trace=TRUE)
  {

...into this:

  isoMDS <- function(d, y, k=2, maxit=50, trace=TRUE)
  {
    if(missing(y)) y <- cmdscale(d, k=k)

Actually, it should work if you simply define the arguments as 

isoMDS <- function(d, y=cmdscale(d, k), k=2, maxit=50, trace=TRUE)

Default arguments can refer to each other and even to items calculated
inside the function.

You don't need to change anything to use dimensions other than 2 (and the
author of pcurve didn't realise this either, it seems).

Just call isoMDS with a k-dimensional start, as the help page says.
One reason for not making this easy is that the starting configuration
is critical and often one can do better than the default, particularly in
higher dimensions.  (Use the results of sammon(), for example, whihc is one
reason why they might need different interfaces.)

Both sammon and isoMDS are about 9 years old (predating MASS), and started
life in different S library sections.  I will not change the interfaces now
(and both proposals would break positional matching).  (They have
maxit vs niter too.)

I will write a test for this when I find some time ...

When I try to start RGUI, it generates an error in application and R chashs.
(NOTE: R worked very well with trial version of Windows 2000!)

Here is the (not very informative form me) Dr Watson's report:

Subject: [Rd] creating packages for Mac
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110150853460.20787-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  OK, a boneheaded question ...

  I've made a set of packages for my students.
  I'm serving these packages from my web site in the form of a set of
tar.gz source packages (constructed with R CMD build) and a set of .zip
Windows binary packages, constructed by cross-compiling according to Brian
Ripley's instructions (make pkg-foo in the src/gnuwin32 directory) and
then zipping up the directories.
  Now I'm wondering what to do for my students with Macs (besides insist
that they work on PCs).  For the most part my packages *don't* really
contain compiled binary information, and I'm not really planning on trying
to cross-compile Mac binaries on Linux (ugh).  All I really want to do is
provide the packages in a form that the students can unzip (or whatever)
reasonably simply.  I could try to look at the form in which the Mac stuff
is provided and replicate that file structure (which would also mean
finding a Linux application to create Stuffit archives), but I'm not sure
where to start.
  I guess the other possibility is convincing one of my students to
download the machinery for creating binary from source packages on their
machines.

  Any ideas?  Has anyone done this?

 Ben

I seem to recall a recommendation regarding a location for including
extra documentation in packages, but I cannot find it now. Where in a
package should I include a pdf file with a users' guide?

Thanks,
Paul Gilbert

My recommendation would be

	inst/doc/foo.pdf

If you don't need to compile binaries you should just give the .zip 
archives to your students and they will work fine under R for MacOS.

If you need to compile .C of fortran sources you need the "machinery" as 
on any other platform.

In the latest R-devel archive there are MPW makefiles that you can use 
to build mac binaries yourself. For the time being, I can help you in 
compiling sources and prepeare the script files. Let me know.

Regards,

			Stefano

Subject: [Rd] possible bugs: boundary conditions and random distribution parameters
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110151554240.22158-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  There are a few inconsistencies, at least, in some of the functions that
generate random deviates from particular distributions (I think they're
bugs because they're inconvenient, but maybe someone can make an argument
for the current behavior).  If people think these are really bugs I can
submit them, together or separately.

1. rlnorm(n,mean,sd) gives NaN for sd=0, rather than always returning
the mean.  This is inconsistent with rnorm(), which returns the mean.

2. rnbinom(n,prob,size) gives NaN when prob=1; always returning 0 would be
reasonable, and consistent with the output of dnbinom().  [This is
equivalent to rnbinom(n,mu=0,size) in the new parameterization.]

3. rgamma(n,shape,scale) happily returns 0 when shape=0.  However,
dgamma(x,shape=0) [and pgamma(x,shape=0)] gives NaN.  This behavior is
actually convenient for me, but I could make an argument for returning a
warning in this case.

  The fixes seem straightforward.

Subject: [Rd] plot function
Message-ID: <3BCC374F.7D553701@umsanet.edu.bo>

Hola!

It is somewhat inconvenient to use plot.function, when add=TRUE.

The following (miniscule) change makes it behave better:

 plot.function <-
function (fn, from , to, xlim = NULL, ...) 
{
    if (!is.null(xlim)) {
        if (missing(from)) 
            from <- xlim[1]
        if (missing(to)) 
            to <- xlim[2]
    }
    curve(fn, from, to, xlim = xlim, ...)
}

The only change is that the default arguments fro from and to
are omitted. (curve() has better code to give sensible defaults)

But this makes problems for curve when add=FALSE is used.

The following miniscule changes to curve restores its behaviour when
add=FALSE: (changes only local to the delay() expression)

curve <- 
function (expr, from, to, n = 101, add = FALSE, type = "l", ylab = NULL, 
    log = NULL, xlim = NULL, ...) 
{
    sexpr <- substitute(expr)
    if (is.name(sexpr)) {
        fcall <- paste(sexpr, "(x)")
        expr <- parse(text = fcall)
        if (is.null(ylab)) 
            ylab <- fcall
    }
    else {
        if (!(is.call(sexpr) && match("x", all.vars(sexpr), nomatch =
0))) 
            stop("'expr' must be a function or an expression containing
'x'")
        expr <- sexpr
        if (is.null(ylab)) 
            ylab <- deparse(sexpr)
    }
    lims <- if (is.null(xlim)) 
        delay({
            if (add) {
            pu <- par("usr")[1:2] } else
            pu <- c(0,1)
            if (par("xlog")) 
                10^pu
            else pu
        }, environment())
    else xlim
    if (missing(from)) 
        from <- lims[1]
    if (missing(to)) 
        to <- lims[2]
    lg <- if (length(log)) 
        log
    else paste(if (add && par("xlog")) 
        "x", if (add && par("ylog")) 
        "y", sep = "")
    x <- if (lg != "" && "x" %in% strsplit(lg, NULL)[[1]]) {
        if (any(c(from, to) <= 0)) 
            stop("`from' & `to' must be > 0      with  log=\"x\"")
        exp(seq(log(from), log(to), length = n))
    }
    else seq(from, to, length = n)
    y <- eval(expr, envir = list(x = x), enclos = parent.frame())
    if (add) 
        lines(x, y, type = type, ...)
    else plot(x, y, type = type, ylab = ylab, xlim = xlim, log = lg, 
        ...)
}

In the following special case, seq fails to give the right answer
(which is  0 )

> seq(0,0,1)
Error in if (dd < sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)) return(from) : 
	missing value where logical needed

For any other equal  from  and  to , it works:

> seq(1,1,1)
[1] 1

The error occurs in the statement

            dd <- abs(del)/max(abs(to), abs(from))

of  seq.default  -- for obvious reasons. 
This is certainly easy to debug...

Thank you for your efforts.

Full_Name: John M. Heumann
Version: 1.3.1

Submission from: (NULL) (192.25.140.108)


Picture 2 scenarios:
   (I) R command window sitting at prompt (no program executing)
      a) Do close action: "X" icon, or Alt-F4, or right click on RGui icon
         and select close.
      b) "Save workspace image" dialog appears.
      c) Press cancel. Program does not exit. This is all correct.

   (II) As in (I) but with a program running in the command window
        (e.g. 'source "foo.r"').
        Perform a), b), c) as above. Once again, RGui does not exit
        (which is correct). However the running program will be terminated
        as if you'd hit Escape, which is not correct. I suspect the
"Esc/Cancel"
        message is being passed on up to RGui, rather than trapped and 
        handled by the dialog.

OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

EMRG from $ .60 to $2.50 in 10 days for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!!!
DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)
BUY AT $1.80
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !!!!

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
NEXT WEEK FOR ROYA !!!

Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted financial
services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher this year due to 9
Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, placing rates at their
lowest levels in almost 4 decades.

ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real estate
sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is on with rates
having dropped to bargain basement levels.

We are expecting significant news next week regarding increasing
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing the bottom line for
rapid revenue growth.  The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think
the stock could easily climb above $6 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS ROYA MAY
VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!

Sorry to jump in rather late on a topic which is bordering off topic
but if Debian people are interested I was working for a while distributing
Linux in Australia and I'm still in touch with the industry, I'll point
out a few observations:

* Debian `potato' CDs were popular when they came out but now they are far 
  too out of date to sell.

* Distributers don't want to make up their own unofficial Debian CDs they
  want something complete, tested and ready to stamp CDs.

* The various minibook/pocketbooks have are always popular and I don't think
  that Debian has ever been included on one of these (various combinations
  of RedHat, Mandrake, and TurboLinux have been).

* The RedHat 7.1 CDs (GPL set) are still popular and the `PowerTools' CD
  includes R-base-1.2.0 and RedHat now have quite low prices on their 
  low-end offerings so people aren't being scared off by the boxed-set premium.

Basically the Australian market is very interested in getting distributions
on CD because not many people have the tinme and money to download the entire
Debian sid down a modem. This is not in any way a comment on the quality of
the Debian product but an observation that current Debian packaging is not
doing much for the distribution of that product.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Unfortunately it seems that RH7.2 will have no PowerTools, but only
the "most important" items from it rolled into the main distribution,
*not* including R (it's not in the beta anyway). On the other hand,
the PowerTools distros have been persistently out of date...

Mandrake 8.2 has R version 1.3.0 as far as I remember.

Subject: [Rd] cex/col/etc. in title(): documentation? (PR#1136)
Message-ID: <200110221551.RAA09762@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  There appears to be a mismatch between the documentation and behavior of
title(), or at least a clarification is in order.  The documentation says
you can pass extra arguments from par() as "...".  However, cex at least
is ignored. Later on in the documentation it becomes clear that you can
specify these extra parameters as part of a list.

  I wouldn't say this is necessarily a bug (and there's certainly a way to
do what you want, if you read the rest of the documentation), but I will
say it didn't seem to follow the same conventions as most of the rest of
the graphical annotation in R.  I would have expected
title(main="foo",cex=2) to set the title larger ...

  I think it would be nicer if title() worked this way, but if it doesn't
it would be nice to have an additional note in the documentation for "..."
to the effect that parameters such as cex, col, etc., should be set using
the list mechanism described below.

## setting parameter with par(): works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  par(cex=i)
  title(main="hello")
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing parameter as part of a list: works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main=list("hello",cex=i))
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing cex as an additional arg: doesn't work
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main="hello",cex=i)
}

Hi, all,

   I swear, bug.report() ate my message!  Apologies to all, esp. Peter who
will once again have to clean up after my mess...

   The bug report was supposed to say:

R> round(100000/3, -2) - 33300
   [1] -7.275958e-12

I would have hoped for 0.  The problem seems to be specifically for negative
"digits".

^^^^^^^^
I can duplicate this under Windows R1.3.0 but not Debian R1.3.1, so it may
have been fixed.  Looking at the changes to arithmetic.c I don't see why,
though.

I would have hoped for 0.  The problem seems to be specifically for negative
"digits".  This is in 1.3.1 on Solaris 2.6 (full description at bottom).

[Apologies for making everyone read this 3 times; my bug.report() burped.]

Peter Dalgaard <p.dalgaard@biostat.ku.dk> says the problem is in fround.c,
which reads in part:
    pow10 = R_pow_di(10., dig)
    ...
    return sgn * (intx + R_rint(x * pow10) / pow10);
and (says Peter),
> the problem is most likely that pow10 (== 1/100) has no finite binary
> representation. Patches are welcome...

I'm not up to patching C code, but I will say that a workaround is:
R> round(round(100000/3, -2)) - 33300
   [1] 0
and a smarter C-programmer could probably implement this concept:
if digits < 0, force the final result to an integer.

It's an accuracy issue, still there in 1.3.1 for Solaris 7. Basically,
dividing by 10^-2 does not always give an integer on SPARC, so we
should be more careful with the logic in fround.c. Beats me why it
would act up on windows, but, well, ...

Subject: [Rd] Possible bug, Rprof() and scan(pipe()) (PR#1140)
Message-ID: <200110232051.WAA27074@pubhealth.ku.dk>

This looks like a bug?
Unable to use scan(pipe()) while profiling.
I have no idea whether this version of R violates the
    "do not use `Rprof' in an executable built for profiling"
warning in ?Rprof.

Thanks

Well, Doug recently paid the dues for r-project.org and
cran.us.r-project.org is working OK from here. Some joker may have
hijacked some name servers though.

Yeah ... it is doing that where I work but not from my ISP. Life in the
digital age, I guess ... I was going to volunteer to pay a year or two
if it really *had* expired, since I don't have time to contribute any *code*.

I just bought two more domains myself; they're *really* cheap these days if
all you want is to have them point somewhere.

Subject: [Rd] broken build with LDFLAGS (PR#1141)
Message-ID: <200110240928.LAA02209@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Denis Sunko
Version: 1.3.1
OS: HP-UX 11.0
Submission from: (NULL) (161.53.2.114)


I invoked configure by

env LDFLAGS=/opt/fortran90/lib ./configure --with-f77=f90

Problem: although configure completed to (its own) satisfaction, the LDFLAGS
information was not propagated everywhere; I had to change the line

PKG_LIBS =   -l:libF90.a -lcl -lisamstub

to

PKG_LIBS =   -L/opt/fortran90/lib -l:libF90.a -lcl -lisamstub

in the files

src/library/ctest/src/Makefile
src/library/modreg/src/Makefile
src/library/mva/src/Makefile
src/library/ts/src/Makefile

by hand.

------
On the wish-list level (not really a bug): it would be nice if configure broke
with a less cryptic message than `f90 and gcc do not agree on int and double',
when all that happens is that it cannot find the fortran library. I suggest
putting -l:libF90.a on the compiler line of a previous (dummy) test program,
just to check for this.

After building and installing R 1.3.1, i find some of the html files missing:

> ls -l /opt/lib/R/doc/manual/
total 0
-rw-r--r--   1 root       sys              0 Oct 17 22:16 R-FAQ.html

-rw-r--r--   1 root       sys              0 Oct 17 22:16 R-lang.html

I can trace this to the lines

.texi.html:
        $(MAKEINFO) --no-split --html -I$(srcdir) $< -o $@ || touch $@

in the file

doc/manual/Makefile

where MAKEINFO is defined (in the same file)

MAKEINFO = false

(correctly, because I don't have the info system installed).

The html files for the packages are all built correctly. The final front
(index)
page for the html documentation also has broken links to various COPYING,
THANKS,
etc. pages.

Well, those files are based on texinfo sources. Without the makeinfo
program you're not going to get them built...

(This is orthogonal to having the info *reader* system installed).

so here goes!  I've only tested it stand-alone, not compiled into the full R
system.  I handle the 3 cases dig=0, dig>0, and dig<0 separately, and note I
avoid a call to R_pow_di altogether in the common case of dig=0.  Hope this is
useful.

Is this still an issue to this community?  If so, and results, I may pick
this up.  Intel does have C++ and Fortran compilers.

You might see a compiler among the list under the links
http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/topic.jsp?catCode=BON.
Evaluation licenses are available at 
http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/

If they are promising, perhaps binaries could at least be built using Intel
compilers.  

But first, are there any R tasks/workloads that we might comparably
benchmark?

Under what OS?

AFAIK the only thing one can do is to find a compiler that optimizes for
the P4, but I don't know of one, nor if it actually helps.  As far as I am
aware under both Linux and Windows the binary versions of R are not
even optimized for an i686 (Pentium Pro/II/III), but I find that under
Windows (and VC++) using the optimizations for i686 makes only negligible
differences.

An easily evaluated benchmark of R performance on Unix/Linux systems
is obtained by running "make check" after building from the sources.
I know there is a similar check done for compilations under Windows
but I don't know how it is run.

"make check" runs every example in every help page in every package
that is shipped with R.  The base package contains the most important
and most commonly used functions.  If everything is successful the
last few lines of the file ./tests/Examples/base-Ex.Rout should read
like

 > cat("Time elapsed: ", proc.time() - get("ptime", env = .CheckExEnv),"\n")
 Time elapsed: 84.22 1.9 105.61 0.82 0.61
 > dev.off(); quit('no')
 null device
           1
The times, in seconds, are the user time, the system time, and
the elapsed (wall clock) time for the parent process, and elapsed and
system times for child processes.  The user time for the parent
process is probably the most important.

The run shown above is for the r-devel sources on a Linux system with
a 1.2 GHz Athlon and 1 GB of PC-133 memory.  The compilers were gcc
and g77 from the 2.95.4 compiler suite.  This compiled version does
use atlas BLAS but that should not make much of a difference on this
benchmark.

Subject: [Rd] Problem testing R version 1.3.1 (PR#1143)
Message-ID: <200110261542.RAA02442@pubhealth.ku.dk>

   I have compiled R version 1.3.1 on a Linux system.  No errors or
warnings are reported.

  However, "make check" fails thus:

=====
make[5]: Leaving directory
`/proj/informatics-build/GML/R/R-1.3.1/src/library'
running code in base-Ex.R ...
../../bin/R --vanilla < base-Ex.R > base-Ex.Rout
make[4]: *** [base-Ex.Rout] Error 139
=====

   The base-Ex.Rout being produced at this point ends with:

=====
> ## 1-d tables
> (Poiss.tab <- table(N = rpois(200, lam= 5)))
N
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 18
 1  4 14 21 46 40 24 14 19 11  3  2  1
=====

   Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the problem may be?


   The configuration parametsr used are:

environment parameters:

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-O2
FC='g77 -L/usr/central/lib'
FFLAGS=-O2
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/common/include
LIBS=-L/usr/central/lib

./configure --prefix=/proj/informatics-build/GML/R/Linux-ia32 \
   --without-readline --without-tcltk --without-gnome


(An equivalent build on an SGI Irix6.5 system also compiles, with
various warnings, but then fails to paas the checks either, but fails on
a later script).

Unfortunately, the output is buffered so that one on catastrophic
error will lose the last bit. It might be more informative if you ran the
command directly, without the redirection to base-Ex.Rout.

No,
but since you're on Linux you can find much more yourself :
Run R inside the debugger:

cd tests/Examples
../../bin/R -d gdb

 and then in (gdb) 

r --vanilla < base-Ex.R

 and it will (hopefully) stop at the same place
 but you'll see more

Odd. There are known issues with stock RH 6.2, but base R usually
compiles and passes make check on those systems. What usually happens
is that some packages refuse to dynload, with the error you're
observing, essentially.

The culprit is somewhere in the compiler suite - 2.95.x is known to
work, and I believe 3.0.x too (whereas the unofficial 2.96 from RH 7.0
caused trouble although later ones for 7.1 and 7.2 seem OK). You might
as well upgrade since R-1.4.0 will definitely not work with that
setup.

We've seen this one before. It's usually due to a problem with the Fortran
compile or flags such as linking in a math library compiled with different
flags from R.

   Confirmed.  I've just found a Mandarke7.2 system with gcc 2.95.2 on,
and that passes the check (as does the RH6.2 system when using these
same binaries).

   Thanks.

   Now to track down the SGI problem....(which is already using gcc
2.95.2).

Message-ID: <200110261805.UAA03272@pubhealth.ku.dk>

   I've compiled R verison 1.3.1 on SGI Irix 6.5

   It fails its check when running the ts-Ex.Rout test with:

=====
>

Error in ar.yw.mts(x, aic = aic, order.max = order.max, na.action =
na.action,  : 
        On entry to DGEMM  parameter number 1 had an illegal value
Execution halted
=====

   It was compiled with gcc 2.95.2 (and the g77 which came with that,
which is 0.5.25).

Subject: [Rd] promax rotation matrix (PR#1146)
Message-ID: <200110261844.UAA03434@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Peter Perkins

Submission from: (NULL) (144.212.95.125)


I believe that line 15 in promax from the mva library is incorrect. It currently
reads
    U <- U %*% xx$rotmat
and I believe it should be 
    U <- xx$rotmat %*% U

I could easily be wrong about this, what with the different definitions of the
rotation matrix vs. its transpose or its inverse.  But as I read the help page,
the rotation returned should be the one right-applied to the unrotated loadings.
 If one gets an unrotated solution from factanal, and then rotates it using
promax, the rotation matrix returned by promax does not rotate the original
loadings to the loadings actually returned by promax.  For example:

> ability.FA <- factanal(factors = 2, covmat = ability.cov, rotation = "none")
> pm <- promax(ability.FA$loadings)
> ability.FA$loadings %*% pm$rotmat

I believe that the latter is correct.  Changing the order of the product in line
15 makes the two the same.

I reported this earlier, and have got reports that others have the same
promlem on UNIX machines, so it is not only a windows problem
S I file a bug report.

The function (boot.stat) given at the end produces a postscript file, 
which cannot be included correctly in LaTeX. Specifically, 
the image in LaTeX (when translated by dvips to postscript)
becomes very small, not using the bounding box, and turned on its head!

Subject: [Rd] warnings --- wish/bug (PR#1148)
Message-ID: <200110261927.VAA03569@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When R prints warnings, they often go "out of the line", it would be
better if they where wrapped with
writeLines(strwrap ...

I tried to do that , changing the function warnings, but it has only
effect when called explicitely, not when R prints the warnings unasked.

Anyhow, here is the changed warnings:

warnings <-
function (...) 
{
    if (!(n <- length(last.warning))) 
        return()
    names <- names(last.warning)
    cat("Warning message", if (n > 1) 
        "s", ":\n", sep = "")
    for (i in 1:n) {
        out <- if (n == 1) 
            names[i]
        else paste(i, ": ", names[i], sep = "")
        if (length(last.warning[[i]])) {
            temp <- deparse(last.warning[[i]])
            out <- paste(out, "in:", temp[1], if (length(temp) > 
                1) 
                " ...")
        }
        writeLines(strwrap(out), ...)
    }
}

This is difficult.  The internal warnings should work as often as
possible without doing memory allocation, which might provoke an error
(*and* we try to print out warnings after a memory allocation error).
So strwrap is a no-no internally.

I've not seen warnings that are not wrapped by the console
(on Unix) or are scrollable (Rgui).   Can you give us an example of the
problem?

Incidentally, I think you want to strwrap the ... too.

That's bad design, but you can scroll the RGui window, surely?

BTW, that's nothing to do with warnings().  The internal code assumes that
the author has used sensible line lengths in the call to warning (R or C)
or warningcall (C).

I tested this. There is definitely something wrong with the
PostScript output. The first command that is called that does
something in the graphics state is 'cl', and this command starts
with a 'grestore'. So, there is a call to 'grestore' in the
PostScipt file that was not preceeded by a call to 'gsave'. The
result is the undoing of a 'gsave' in the embedding code.

I compared the PostScript code to the code that was generated
with another graphic that didn't cause any problemns. Seems that
what is missing in the defective code is a call to 'bp' at the
start. Inserting this command before the first call to 'cl'
fixes the problem.

Why 'bp' is missing is something someone else should figure out.

Thanks for the analysis. For debugging, the following minimal example
may be helpful

b<-
function () 
{
    split.screen(c(1, 2))
    screen(1)
    plot(0)
}
b();postscript();b();dev.off()

notice that it will not happen unless you plot to the screen first.

Subject: [Rd] psignrank and pwilcox null pointer deref (PR#1149)
Message-ID: <200110262150.XAA04192@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Charles J. Geyer
Version: 1.3.1
OS: SuSE 7.2
Submission from: (NULL) (134.84.86.22)


in line 90 of signrank.c and lines 114 and 273 of wilcox.c calloc is used and
the return is not checked to see if it is null (violating numbers 2 and 6 of
the ten commandments for C programmers).  The following code thus makes
R segfault (for suitably large values of 1000)

for (n in seq(100, 1000, 100)) {
   mu <- n * (n + 1) / 4
   sigma <- sqrt(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 24)
   z <- floor(qnorm(0.05, mu, sigma))
   p <- psignrank(z, n)
   cat("z = ", z, ", n = ", n, ", p = ", p, "\n", sep="")
}

for (n in seq(100, 1000, 100)) {
   m <- n
   mu <- n * m / 2
   sigma <- sqrt(m * n * (m + n + 1) / 12)
   z <- floor(qnorm(0.05, mu, sigma))
   p <- pwilcox(z, m, n)
   cat("z = ", z, ", m = ", m, ", n = ", n, ", p = ", p, "\n", sep="")
}

A fix is hard because a good solution would free all the previously allocated
memory before dying.  Probably a better algorithm is needed.  But I don't know
if one exists.

Anyway the current behavior is unacceptable.

The note to 1004 says "fixed for 1.3.1"

Uh.  No.  It ain't.

The problem was more serious than guessed as even the simplest testing
would show.

For example, Example 5.4 in Hollander and Wolfe (Nonparametric Statistical,
Methods, 2nd ed., Wiley, 1999, pp. 180-181)

R Version 1.3.1 (SuSE Linux 7.1)

> X <- read.table(url("http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/5601/hwdata/t5-7.txt"),
+     header = TRUE)
> names(X)
[1] "x" "y"
> attach(X)
> ks.test(x, y)
 
        Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
data:  x and y
D = 0.6, p-value = 0.01234
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

Not hardly.  Hollander and Wolfe say the exact P-value is 0.0524.  Note

> ks.test(x, y, exact = FALSE)
 
        Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
data:  x and y
D = 0.6, p-value = 0.05465
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

Agrees.  Thus the algorithm for the exact null distribution of the two-sample
K-S test statistic is erroneous.  I. e., there is something wrong with the
function "psmirnov2x" in ks.c.  I don't yet know what the problem is.

Here's part of the problem:

Browse[1]> .C("psmirnov2x", p = as.double(STATISTIC), as.integer(n.x),
as.integer(n.y), PACKAGE = "ctest")$p
[1] 0.9876594

as.integer(n.y), PACKAGE = "ctest")$p
[1] 0.9475524
Browse[1]> STATISTIC
[1] 0.6

Perplexed? The reason is of course that

Browse[1]> STATISTIC-0.6
[1] 1.110223e-16

and the KS distribution is discontinuous, so the point probability at
0.6 didn't get counted. Looks like we need a fudge factor.

Subject: [Rd] wilcox.test point estimates perverse (PR#1150)
Message-ID: <200110262309.BAA04442@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The point estimates produced by wilcox.test are perverse (not wrong, just
brain damaged).  The Hodges-Lehmann estimator that goes with the signed
rank test is the median of the Walsh averages.  The Hodges-Lehmann estimator
that goes with the rank sum test is the median of the pairwise differences.

wilcox.test agrees except that it uses the following very peculiar definition
of "sample median": if the number of items is even, the average of the two
middle items (agrees with the usual definition), and if the number of items
is odd, the average of the two on either side of the middle item in sorted
order (huh???  why???).  I know this is asymptotically equivalent to the
usual definition, but

  * Why get answers that disagree with every nonparametrics textbook?

  * If wilcox.test is right then median is wrong and should be fixed
    (just kidding, don't mess with median!)

Thus the complicated code in lines 87--89 of wilcox.test.default
should be replaced by the simple

  ESTIMATE <- median(diffs)

and the complicated code in lines 214-216 of wilcox.test.default should
be again be replaced replaced by the simple

  ESTIMATE <- median(diffs)

Moreover, there is NO "correction for ties" in the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.
Thus the code in lines 147-148 and 272-273 is silly.  The code for the point
estimate should be done by exactly the same code when there are ties or zeroes
(or both) and when there are not.  Reference: Sections 3.2 and 4.2 of
Hollander and Wolfe.

I understand that one doesn't want to produce the vector diffs (which is
order n^2 when n is large), but one doesn't have to to calculate the median
if this is taken to C.

Moreover that uniroot stuff sometimes crashes (sorry, I didn't save the
examples, but take my word for it, it's not bulletproof).

Note that the confidence intervals are also bizarre in the case of ties, but
that's another bug report.

For tied samples this estimators may be not inside the confidence sets which
is confusing. Example (from ?wilcox.exact, package exactRankTests):

> treat <- c(94, 108, 110, 90)
> contr <- c(80, 94, 85, 90, 90, 90, 108, 94, 78, 105, 88)
> 
> # StatXact 4 for Windows: p.value = 0.0989, point prob = 0.019
> 
> wilcox.exact(contr, treat, conf.int=T)

        Exact Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  contr and treat 
W = 9, point prob = 0.019, p-value = 0.0989 
alternative hypothesis: true mu is not equal to 0 
95 percent confidence interval:
 -22   4 
sample estimates:
difference in location 
                    13 		<- when computed with median(diffs)

For compatibility between the 2 versions of the Wilcoxon-Test, 
we use the basic definition: 

  d_1 = sup {d | W(d) > E(W) }
  d_2 = inf {d | W(d) < E(W) }

  Hodges-Lehmann = mean(d1,d2)

(using max and min instead of sup and inf which causes the difference).
However, this may be questionable ...

wilcox.test uses the normal approximation when 

a) the sample sizes are large or
b) ties occur.

computing all differences when a) is not feasible (taking it to C does not
improve `outer(x,y,"-")' significantly). Therefore, we
use uniroot for searching d with W(X - d, Y) = E(W).

In case b) in `wilcox.test' the normal
approximation is used for p-values and confidence intervals, it seems
natural to me to compute the point estimator the way the conf ints are
computed. Additionally median(diffs) may lie outside the confidence set
in this situation (see above).

Because the normal approximation is bizzare for small, tied samples? 
That is what `wilcox.exact' is for.

Hi,
I need to append one vector to another in C. I have this little test
program that crashes is this not what append is for? 

#include<R.h>
#include<Rinternals.h>

SEXP apt(SEXP a, SEXP b){

  SEXP ans;
  PROTECT(ans = append(a,b));
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);

}

Thanks

There is minus sign missing in the formula for cdf of Logistic distribution.

Instead of

should be

Full_Name: Hsiu-Khuern Tang

Hi,

The current documentation for approx() contains the following paragraph:

       f: For `method="constant"' a number between 0 and 1 inclusive,
          indicating a compromise between left- and right-continuous
          step functions. If `y0' and `y1' are the values to the left
          and right of the point then the value is `y0*f+y1*(1-f)' so
          that `f=0' is right-continuous and `f=1' is left-continuous.

The formula

y0*f+y1*(1-f)

should be

y0*(1-f)+y1*f

This will make it consistent with the claim that "`f=0' is right-continuous and
`f=1' is left-continuous", as well as with the actual code:

approx(1:2, 1:2, xout=1.5, method="constant", f=1)
$x
[1] 1.5

$y
[1] 2

Best,
Hsiu-Khuern.

Thank you, Jan.
A "cut&paste" typo I have fixed for "R-devel" (to be 1.4.0).

Well, I don't get either of those:

[1] "2001-12-12 23:40:00" "2001-12-12 23:50:00" "2001-12-13 00:00:00"
[4] "2001-12-13 00:10:00"

It would be helpful to give the incorrect output that your system gives.
In the output below I see no evidence of `the times wrap'.  Using the
wrong day seems to be a bug in glibc's strptime, but you need to unclass
the strptime result to see this.  (I do see the strptime bug on RH6.2
Linux, where the day field is ignored.)

Yes, but that was not the intention in the original (real) example,
where the year was not specified.

Again, the need was to use `time' after the detach.  This only
occurred because you did not remove the variable your system created
incorrectly.

I will change this to work around a system-specific bug.  I'll pass on to
the Windows maintainer fixing the strptime code used on that platform.

No bug.  Here's the clarification:

Contrary to the other implementations of S,
R differentiates different usages of "cex", "col" and "font" :

 > .Pars[grep("^cex",.Pars)]
 [1] "cex"      "cex.axis" "cex.lab"  "cex.main" "cex.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^col",.Pars)]
 [1] "col"      "col.axis" "col.lab"  "col.main" "col.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^font",.Pars)]
 [1] "font"      "font.axis" "font.lab"  "font.main" "font.sub" 

and ?par *does* document this.

Hence the "..." in axis() should really be ``filled'' with cex.axis, etc.

The following is an example demonstrating R's possibilities

plot(1, col.axis = "sky blue", col.lab = "thistle")
title("Main Title", sub = "sub title", 
      cex.main = 2,   font.main= 4, col.main= "blue",
      cex.sub = 0.75, font.sub = 3, col.sub = "red")

I've located the problem, which boils down to inaccuracies in the
following in man strptime:

       The  GNU  libc  implementation does not touch those fields
       which are not directly initialized.   Exceptions  are  the
       tm_wday  and  tm_yday elements which are recomputed if any
       of the year, month, or date elements changed.

As RMH's example shows, it does touch the tm_mon and tm_mday fields if the
year is specified (even if unchanged) but not quite always.

I am writing a workaround for R-devel.  Yet another system-specific
problem with the date-time code!

       Hi,
       The function help.start() assume that the brower is netscape
which is no longer the dominant brower in used. I am using now opera
and other use mozilla or Microsoft IE. I can always type
help.start(browser="opera"), but it is not convenience: I would like
to be able to set the default brwsernone for all. But the real bug is
that even after launching help.start(browser="opera"), other help
commands, help(help), say, still send the "help page" to netscape. Here
is what I get

> help.start(browser="opera")
If opera  is already running,   it is *not* restarted,
 and you must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient..
> help(help)          
help() for help  is shown in browser netscape ...
Use      help( help , htmlhelp=FALSE)
or       options(htmlhelp = FALSE)
to revert.
> sh: netscape: command not found

Please correct this bug.

On what operating system is this?  On Unix/Linux you should be using
options(browser="opera").  On Windows/Mac you can't set the browser
anyway.

See the requirements for a browser in the details under ?help.start.
Neither of those (nor Netscape 6.1) worked when I tried them with -remote.

I don't think it is a bug in R but I have expanded the documentation.

Please do use the bug.report() function, as critical information is
missing from this report.

I am sorry not having looked carefully on the documentation. But the
first thing I do is to launch help.start() and be stuck with an
inexistent browser. I have imagined that help.start(browser="opera")
would set the browser to opera, but I am wrong and the browser must be
set by options(browser="opera"), a feature which I am not aware of.
Nevertheless, I find this rather confusing for a new user: if
options(browser="opera") should always be used to set the browser,
then the argument browser="opera" in help.start would never be needed.

The documentation issue may be unfortunate, but there is really no point
unless we find browsers other than Netscape which can be controlled
remotely.  I have been raising this issue a couple of times, last time
about three months ago or so.  Mozilla then claimed to support -remote
as Netscape does but really did not.  Konqueror does not allow being
sent URLs remotely, and neither does gnome-help-browser.  Not sure about
Opera ... do you have more info?

Subject: [Rd] strptime bug (PR#1155)
Message-ID: <200110312232.XAA20303@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Where is the strptime bug happening?  I am seeing it on W95 W98 W2000
running Rterm under ntemacs 21.1 with ESS 5.1.19 and using cygwin
2001/08/31 15:52:16 Starting cygwin install, version 2.78.2.3

Is strptime using the bash from my system? or is it using functions
that are included with R?

R defaulted to 1900 when I didn't specify a year.  The 1990 came from
the help(beav1).

When I explicitly place a year in the file, either the 1990 inidcated
in the help(beav1) file or the 1900 chosen to match the default, then
R gives me times consistent with the input.

help(lm)

says that

  An object of class `"lm"' is a list containing at least the
     following components:

  ...

  formula: the formula supplied.


But is the "formula" component necessarily present?

An example:

Nicely spotted. Yes, it's present:

> formula(temp)
y ~ x

However, it is part of the terms (and model) component, not a
component in itself (str(temp) to see it) so should probably not be
documented as such.

Message-ID: <200110011343.PAA16182@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi everyone,
  I have just tried to compile R 1.3.1 on the following platform:

R is now configured for mips-sgi-irix6.5

  Source directory:          .
  Installation directory:    /usr/local
  C compiler:                gcc  -g -O2
  C++ compiler:              g++  -g -O2
  FORTRAN compiler:          g77  -g -O2

  X11 support:               yes
  Gnome support:             no
  Tcl/Tk support:            no

  R profiling support:       yes
  R as a shared library:     no

and came up with the following error:

making Lapack.d from Lapack.c
        gcc -I. -I../../../src/include -I../../../src/include -I/usr/local/include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -fPIC  -g -O2 -c Lapack.c -o Lapack.lo

        g77  -fPIC  -g -O2 -c cmplx.f -o cmplx.lo
don't know how to make # (bu42).
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

What is "bu42" and or error code "bu21"? And how do I get R to compile?
Thanks,
Patrick.

Subject: [Rd] problem with strptime example (PR#811)
Message-ID: <200110011358.PAA16380@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hello,

strptime is still not working correctly in my computer 
(Windows 98 and R Version 1.3.1)  

From

x <- c("1jan1960", "2jan1960", "31mar1960", "30jul1960")
strptime(x, "%d%b%Y")

I obtain

[1] "NA" "NA" "NA" "NA"

while 
x <- c("01011960", "02011960", "3131960", "3071960")
strptime(x, "%d%m%Y")

gives 
[1] "1960-01-01" "1960-01-02" "1960-03-31" "1960-07-30"

So it seems that the problem is with %b.

Highly system-dependent codes, I'd guess. Are you using GNU make?

This is working as documented, i.e. correctly.

Do read all the example, which contains an explanation and workaround
(which does not work on all systems and hence is in the comments).

In your locale `jan' is not the abbreviation for January, I believe.

This works fine for me on a similar setup. Does Finnish localisation
do strange things with month names??

Be careful!  Both gnudoit and gnuclient could be used, depending on

well, the current code has a hard-coded "gnudoit", so what Thomas
reported was clearly a docu bug, which I fixed. If we want to support
gnuclient in addition to gnudoit that would be a new feature ... when
is which used?

Subject: [Rd] calling browser in Windows
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110021342140.30794-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  I'm working on the interface to LiveGraphics3D (Java applet for dynamic
3D graphics) that I mentioned earlier on the list, and I've hit a
cross-platform problem.
  I want to allow the option of popping up a browser or opening the file
in a browser automatically.  On Unix, the following (stolen from
help.start()) works:

system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null || ",
               browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))

If I want to do this in Windows, options("browser") is NULL.  (For now I'm
hardcoding browser to "C:/PROGRA~1/INTERN~1/IEXPLORE.EXE", but this
clearly isn't a general solution.) The syntax of the call is also
different (IE at least appears to require just the file name, "file:/"
just seems to confuse it).  I don't know how to start a browser in the
background, or do the equivalent of -remote ...  help.start() is
considerably more internalized on Windows, so I'm not getting much useful
there.

  Here's what I'm doing now:

  mach <- machine()
  if (mach=="Unix") {
    url <- paste("file:",file.path(getwd(),fn),sep="")
    system(paste(browser, " -remote \"openURL(", url, ")\" 2>/dev/null ||
",
                 browser, " ", url, " &", sep = ""))
  }
  else if (mach=="Windows") {
    system(paste(browser,file.path(getwd(),fn)))
  }
}


  Is there a different idiom I should be using for Windows?
  I suppose it's all completely different for the Mac too ...
  Might it be possible to standardize this interface?

 thanks,
  Ben Bolker

After some investigations:
In plotmath.c, line 2250 the "the gap between the nucleus and the
radical extension" is defined:
 #define RADICAL_GAP    0.4

It looks like this gap is not added to the hight (or included in the
calculations of the hight) of the denominator of a fraction. So the
whole denominator is located to close to the fraction bar, if a root is
drawn.
I don't see, how this can be fixed smartly ...

Subject: [Rd] tiny typo in optim/N-M documentation (PR#1109)
Message-ID: <200110031509.RAA09208@pubhealth.ku.dk>


In the optim() documentation,  the control parameter "maxit" says
"There is no other stopping criteria."  That should be "are", or
"criterion" ...

While I'm at it -- poking at the code a little bit, it looks as if the
initial simplex is set from the initial point by displacing each
parameter value by max(0.1,0.1*pmax(fabs(Bvec))), where Bvec is the
initial parameter set.  It would be nice to have a bit more external
control of this procedure.
  Is anyone interested in hacking this?  If I did it myself would
anyone be interested in the results?  Or does fussing with the
Nelder-Mead simplex seem silly because anyone who is really serious
about optimization will being using another method anyway?

Subject: [Rd] Several R vs S-Plus issues (PR#1110)
Message-ID: <200110031539.RAA09399@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Hi, all,

   I've been converting code from S-Plus ("S" for short) to R for a few weeks.
Here are some differences I've found, aside from the big well-known ones
(scoping, models, data storage) and the contents of Kurt Hornik's FAQ section
3.3.3.  Let me start with the ones that seem like serious bugs or deficiencies:

1) LETTERS[c(NA,2)] in S is c("","B"), but in R is c("NA","B").

  This is TERRIBLE!  I have a ton of S-Plus code that looks like:
     y$ticker <- z$ticker[match(y$cusip, z$cusip)]
  and I count on a ticker of "" to indicate failed lookups.  Not only will
  I need to change all that code, but I'll never be able to trade Nabisco
  (ticker NA) again.  PLEASE re-consider this choice, or at least make it
  an option: option(na.char="").


2) system() has no "input" argument in R.

   Here's a (Unix) example:
   S> system("cd mydir; latex myfile", input="x")
     which goes to the directory where myfile lives and LaTeX's it, passing
     an "x" through STDIN in case LaTeX encounters an error.  My R fix is:
   R> system("cd mydir; echo x | latex myfile")
   Note that it's not as simple as  cmd <- paste("echo",input,"|",cmd).


3) R> myfun <- function(x, ...) {x[...] <- 0;  x}
   R> myfun(3)
   Error in myfun(3) : SubAssignArgs: invalid number of arguments

   It failed because no ... was given.  Fortunately, this is easily patched:
   R> myfun <- function(x, ...) {if (missing(...)) x[]<-0 else x[...]<-0; x}


4) Missing functions:
   a) identical() [scheduled for 1.4.0]
   b) slice.index()
   c) rowSums(), colSums(), colVars(), etc.
   d) unpaste() - R has strsplit, whose result is like the transpose of unpaste


5) rowsum() gives character dimnames in S, factor numbers in R.
   I've reported this early, and Brian D. Ripley promised a fix in 1.4.0.


OK, the rest are just differences, not complaints.  In fact, sometimes they are
very good differences.

1) Same argument given twice produces an error in R; S takes the last one.
   S> mean(x=4, x=5)    # Returns 5
   R> mean(x=4, x=5)    # Error

2) row.names(y) <- LETTERS[1:3] coerces list to dataframe in S, is error in R.

3) Default "what" for scan in S is "", in R is double(0).

4) Default "quote" for scan is "'\"" in R, causes different behavior than S.

5) which(<numeric>) converts to logical in S, is an error in R.

6) The NULL returned by if(F){...} is invisible in R, visible in S.

7) The NULL returned by return() is visible in R, invisible in S.

8) Args to "var" differ, and R has "cov".  S na.method="a" is like R use="p".

9) var (or cov) drops dimensions in S, not R.

10) cut allows labels=F in R, not in S (also left.include=T becomes right=F).

11) substring(s,"x") <- "X" only works in S, but R has s <- gsub("x","X",s).

12) S function casefold() replaced in R by toupper() or tolower().

13) Functions missing from S: sub(), gsub(), chartr(), toupper(), tolower()

14) Log scale indicated in S with par(xaxt)=="l", in R with par("xlog")==T.

?summary.lm

refers under "Value:" to something called "lm.obj".  Shouldn't that be
"object"?


Similarly

?summary.glm

refers under "Arguments:dispersion:", and again under "See also:", to something
called "glm.obj", which again looks like it ought to be "object" or "x"?


Apologies for reporting two at once, but these seem to be so similar as to be
best taken together.

Apologies also if I am missing some convention which makes these not errors.

Also in assign() there some arguments lacking in R such as 'frame' and

None of the web page on bug tracking, the ?bug.report help page,

 - that only one bug should go in each report
 - that it's a good idea to discuss things on r-devel if you're not sure
something
is a bug.

I'd add this to the bug.report disclaimer:

"If you are not sure if what you see is a bug, please discuss it on the r-devel

mailing list first.  If you are sure, please copy the bug report 
(after finishing it) to your favorite email program and send it to

The other places could have more verbose versions of this advice, including 
advice not to cc it to other lists.

I think we do not want to change this.

Splus has

> (1:2)[c(NA,2)]
[1] NA  2
> is.na((1:2)[c(NA,2)])
[1] T F
> is.na(c(TRUE, FALSE)[c(NA,2)])
[1] T F

etc, so I think the logic would be that we get NA whenever we subscript
by NA.  The current Splus behavior for character vectors is different,
and I do not see why it should.  Note that in R,

R> is.na(LETTERS[c(NA,2)])
[1]  TRUE FALSE

so we really have NA but it is printed as "NA" (and this might be
another case where <NA> would be better).

Doug Bates had raised this issue some time ago.  In the interest of
keeping the S language core as small as possible, I'd rather recommend
against adding these.  We can basically do that same using apply(), and
if the point is to have fast C code I think we should rather
special-case apply accordingly.

This is a function from the chron package, and it is also available in
the R version of chron.  Again, I am not sure whether this should be in
the S language core: we have strsplit.

I am a happy (but serious) user of simplex optimisation in "optim".  I
think that it would be a very good idea to be able to over-ride the
default initial simplex through an argument to the "control" list.  So
if you do the hack please publish it, and if not, let me know and I will
have a go instead.

You have 900 columns and only 270 rows, hence you should have a
vertical rectangle that is approx. 3 times as wide as high.

The difference to calling image() on a matrix is deliberate: if you
store a picture as a matrix (as usual), then you'd expect element 1,1
of that matrix to correspond to the upper left corner. That is
different from what image() does, because it was designed for doing
the right thing for matrices produced by, e.g., outer() ... [at least
I think that's the reason for image() rotating the matrix].

Best,
Fritz

I agree with the point that the upper left corner must be the
1,1 cell in the matrix for a "natural" display of the matrix
as an image. But this does not mean that the matrix should be rotated.
In all image processing packages that I know of, an image with
200 cols and 100 rows is displayed as a horizontal rectangle. Note
that, if there is geometric correction to a geographic projection,
the columns go W to E as left to right and the rows N to S as
top to bottom. In fact,
the "natural" display should follow the same geometry than print,
i.e.,

> matrix(1:12,ncol=6,nrow=2)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9   11
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10   12
> 

should be displayed as a horizontal rectangle.

Of course you can do it as you want because this is your package,
but are you sure that you want it the way it is?

Agus

Fixed now for r-devel. Will commit shortly.

(Martin, here's a way to test all characters:

 x <- y <- unlist(as.list(
   parse(text=paste("\"\\",
         as.character(structure(0:255,class="octmode")),
         "\"",sep=""))))
 save(x, ascii=T, file="here")
 load("here")
 all(x==y)

- I'd commit it for the regression test suite, but I'm not sure what
our conventions are for temporary files)

BTW: printing and deparsing x and y causes display corruption. Perhaps
we should have an isprint somewhere?

Hi!

The function get.hist.quote in the package tseries (Version 0.7-6) does not work
in 
my computer. 
I found that it uses the function strptime which did not "understand" English
month
names in my Finnish locale (see bug report 811). I changed the regional settings
to 
be English (UK) and strptime started to work as I liked. However, get.hist.quote
does 
not work yet, since the function julian does not work. Is this problem only in
my computer? The previous version of get.hist.quote (tseries 0.7-0) did work.

Sys.time and julian produce

I think NA and "NA" are treated in a very confusing way in R.  In y
below, I construct an NA the way you did above; in z, I use the string
'NA'.  As far as I can tell the vectors are identical.  In w, I use
paste(NA), and get something different.  I also tried paste('NA'), and
get something that looks like w.

Doug was responding to a request from a poster at fmr.com (I believe
it was David in fact) for the colSums function.  I showed how an add-on
package with this function could be created.  I'm sure that all these
functions could be added easily in a separate package.  

Perhaps I was overly subtle in my phrasing but I wrote the message on
how to create a package so as to encourage others to add these
functions instead of relying on a member of the core group having the
time and inclination to do so.

I agree with Kurt that we would want to have a strong reason for
adding these functions to the base language.  Kurt has actively
promoted the idea of basing R on a small, tight language core that is
supplemented by packages.  Toward this end Kurt has done an incredible
amount of work on tools for package attachment, checking, and
documentation.

The goal of a small tight language core supplemented by
user-contributed modules is in keeping with the spirit of open source
projects.  The R core team, especially Kurt and Fritz, devote
considerable effort to creating tools to make it easy for others to
contribute their work.  A commercial developer is more inclined to
define the language and capabilities in house where they have control
and where they can provide support.  This is not a criticism of
commercial development.  If you are required to provide support for
the software you must be able to control the code.

Those on the r-devel list may want to check the web site
                   http://developer.r-project.org/
occasionally.  Some plans for the future and items for discussion are
given there.

Excactly, I agree with everything you say!

you mean it doesn't do that? which version of pixmap, which version of
R on which platform?

Using 

R> x <- matrix(1:12,ncol=6,nrow=2)
R> library(pixmap)
R> plot(as.pixmap(x))

I get the attached picture, which is what you want, no?

Best,

Hello, R-devel!

I posted to R-help, and (inappropriately) to R-bugs, this R/S-Plus difference:
> LETTERS[c(NA,2)] in S is c("","B"), but in R is c("NA","B")

Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at> wrote:

This is merely a statement about is.na(), namely that it flags the string
"NA".  There is no distinction in R between the "NA" that arises from
subsetting with a missing value, and the "NA" that represents Nabisco.  Note:
  R> all.equal(LETTERS[c(NA,2)][1], substring("NABISCO",1,2))
  [1] TRUE

R thinks I am missing data when I trade Nabisco, in the Netherlands/Antilles,
or through trader Neil Armstrong.  In each case, "" would more likely indicate
a missing value; there is no stock with that ticker, country with that symbol,
or trader with those initials.

I'd think it would be easy to make is.na() flag "" instead of "NA".  However,
I'm stuck at the definition:
  R> is.na
  .Primitive("is.na")
so I don't know how to change it (I'm a lousy developer, you see).

I propose again that we provide options(na.char="NA"), so users can make their
own choice.  Thanks for listening!

Other's have been on the warpath re. this issue lately (and it's been
an annoyance for years - NorAdrenalin, Nitric Acid, etc.). It's not
unlikely to find a solution for 1.4, but probably not the one you are
proposing. Basically, we should have a *real* NA for string variables,
distinct from the character string "NA" and propagating like any other
NA's.

Inserting a value to substitute for missing could be handled
differently, e.g. via

replace.na <- function(x,r){x[is.na(x)]<-r; x}

I think we do want to change this (as we discussed quite recently) but by
adding a genuine character NA.  The problem is not that LETTERS[c(NA,2)]
returns a missing value, it's that it isn't missing enough. We need a
"NaS" (Not a String) value that can't be confused with Nabisco, but also
can't be confused with an empty string.

I could go for that.  How would it appear when cat()ed or print()ed?

Agreed.  As Peter said, subscripting by NA should give NA but R cannot
distinguish a string NA from the string NA.  However, David (I think)
was suggesting that subscripting a string with NA should give an empty
string, which I think cannot be right.  It must be NaS in your sense.

I think <NA> to distinguish from "NA".

R 1.4.0 already has

    o   Printing factors with both level "NA" and missing values
        uses `<NA>' for the missing values to distinguish them.

I am confused by the subject: above you indicate that get.hist.quote
does not work because julian does not work.

What precisely are your locale settings?

But it does make some sort of distinction, as my example contrasting
"NA" with paste(NA) shows.  In case you missed it:

Yes.  is.na() of a string is true if that string is actually a reference
to R_NaString.  Parsing a literal "NA" will give R_NaString, as will
coercing NA from some other type.  However, paste() doesn't check whether
it produces "NA". Neither does toupper()
  > is.na(toupper("na"))
  [1] FALSE
  > toupper("na")
  [1] "NA"


So we're partway there already, in fact.  It looks like we basically
need to
1) stop the parser generating R_NaString from \"NA\"
2) Change PRINTNAME(R_NaString) to avoid ambiguity

One more (at least :-))

3) fix saveload.c to preserve NA status in strings.

Right now we have

> x<-as.character(list(NA, "NA", paste(NA)))
> x
[1] "NA" "NA" "NA"
> is.na(x)
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> save(list="x", file="tmp.RData")
> load("tmp.RData")
> x
[1] "NA" "NA" "NA"
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE

It's easy enough to fix in principle--just add another case to
NewSaveSpecialHook and NewLoadSpecialHook.  Unfortunately this means
workspace files that contain string NA's written with this new
convention won't be readable by older versions of R (I think it will
generate an "unknown type" error) (and probably leave the file
opened).

Subject: [Rd] library(..., pos=4)
Message-ID: <200110042110.f94LAW627097@arbres1a.FMR.Com>

Hello again, r-devel,

   I propose adding a "pos" argument to library(), so that one can attach the
library in a position other than 2.  It seems straightforward, just 2 changes:

1) pos=2  at the end of the argument list,
2) env <- attach(NULL, pos, name=pkgname)  in line 22

Indeed the authors seem to have anticipated this by defining "lib.pos" further
on, rather than hard-coding it as 2.

   Please let me know (gently) if I have not described my request properly...

Submission from: (NULL) (140.107.26.74)


I noticed while reading some of the html documentation (e.g. R-intro.html) that
many of the internal links in the documents were broken.  At least they don't
work in Mozilla 0.9.3.  This is because the strings for the internal references
include %20 rather than just spaces.  This could easily be fixed with a perl
script to replace all instances of %20 with ' '.

I tried this on R-intro.html and it worked.

Spaces in links are *supposed* to be coded as %20, becauses
spaces are not allowed in URLs, including internal links. At
least, with some versions of Netscape, links with spaces don't
work.

ok, found the pronlem: my fault.
I was using v.0.1. With Version: 0.2-1
it's ok. 

I observe that you stretch lineraly now within
pixmap. The problem is that you use the max
of all 3 bands, which is not normally good.
Also an optional "normal" stretching should
provide better results in most cases. I'll 
send you the code and an attached example
(only to Friedrich.Leisch@ci.tuwien.ac.at to avoid
annoying other people) in a while.

the NEWS file in  1.4.0-devel states: 

o   mean() has `data frame' method applying mean column-by-column.
    When applied to non-numeric data mean() now returns NA rather

which means: 

R> mean(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] NA
Warning message: 
argument is not numeric: returning NA in: mean.default(c(TRUE, FALSE)) 

but: 

R> sum(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] 1

?sum states: 

     sum(..., na.rm=FALSE)

Arguments:

     ...: numeric vectors.

and clearly

R> is.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE))
[1] FALSE


this is confusing, isn't it? I think that `sum' and `mean' should take the
same arguments (and one probably will not allow to sum up logicals) or am
I missing something?

Hmm. That slipped in without me noticing. Summing logicals is a fairly
common practice, as in 

sem <- sd(x,na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))

Taking means of logicals is somewhat more rare, but it does work in
Splus 6.0 and it is a general rule coerce to logicals to 0/1, so I
suspect that this is just an oversight and we want mean.default to
start with

    if (!is.numeric(x) && !is.complex(x) && !is.logical(x)) {
        warning("argument is not numeric: returning NA")
        return(as.numeric(NA))

If Brian really meant otherwise, he'll explain why when he gets back
from Switzerland...

I think this is what you are interested in:

   R (1.3.1) appears to have a bug (well a mis-feature, I suppose).

   It places architecture-specific and architecture-dependent files in
the same locations.  This means that the common files cannot be shared
across installations on multiple architectures.

   It would be nice if it could separate these under exec_prefix and
prefix and look in the relevant one for each file.

Back-compatibility.  In data frames logicals used to get coerced to
two-level factors, not to numerics, and then mean would fail for them.
If a logical is an experimental factor, sums make sense but means do not.

Here is what I find confusing (1.3.1).

> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
> mean(x)
[1] 0.5
> DF <- data.frame(x = x)
> mean(DF$x)
Error in Summary.factor(..., na.rm = na.rm) :
        "sum" not meaningful for factors

There 1.4.0 is consistent.

Change it if you like, but do think through all the implications of the
inconsistent treatment of logicals (for which I have not had time as yet).

What would be `nice' about it? There are `architecture-specific' (also
known as `architecture-dependent', sic) files all over the place in R.
There are few files that are not platform-dependent: for example many of
the help files and the base R code file are.  Many of these are not
executables and do not belong under `exec_prefix'.

This cannot be a space issue this century (as it was originally I believe),
as surely you can afford the disc space for copies of R for each of a
sensible number of platforms?

Suppose one did combine the trees for i386-linux and ppc-linux.  What do
you think would happen when i386-linux is upgraded and ppc-linux is not?
And R is designed to be upgraded on the fly, using update.packages().  We
have public R installations for sparc-solaris, i386-linux and Windows and
sharing them for R would be a nightmare for the administrators.  (We do
share them for TeX, for example.)

I changed the title, because this is not about browser() but about HTML
viewers, and the problem is on Unix not Windows.

I think it's a within-Unix-platform problem, mainly.  The other two ports
have a simple procedure: it's Unix/Linux where the problems arise.

And last time we tested this that only works if the browser is netscape
4.7x, so the freedom is illusory.

Look at help, just as you should for Unix.

?shell.exec

(A better way to say this is that is completely different under Unix, but
Mac and Windows are similar.)

Yes, one might be able to persuade the Unix world to agree on one ....
What help() does does not even work with Netscape 6.01 (and I have yet to
try it with 6.1).

Actually, only the deparsing of the expression is wrong, cf:

> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]]
exp(-x - xmid/scal)
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]]
-x - xmid/scal
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]][[2]]
-x - xmid
> deriv(~offv+Asym/(1+exp(-(x-xmid)/scal)),"x")[[1]][[2]][[3]][[2]][[2]][[2]]
x - xmid

I.e. the expression is really exp((-(x - xmid))/scal). It is a
well-known problem with the deparser that it doesn't parenthesize
properly based on operator hierarchy. Similarly, the parser should
probably drop parentheses in most cases.

r-bugs@biostat.ku.dk

Hi,

I have found something I guess is a bug in write.table.  When saving
the object "e2" (see the session transcription below, I have attached
the Rdata file in gzipped form), the resulting table (also attached)
contains a spurious space in the front of columns from starting the
column "c05ak01" (column 234).

This would not be a problem, but if the object is large (the original
database contained not 10 but 7000 observations), some of the colums
are missing at all.  The problem is similar when you use quote=FALSE
option.

Best wishes

Message-ID: <3BC1D795.A8F6E86D@umsanet.edu.bo>

Hola!

I have problems running Rcmd check (windows 98, R1.3.0)

It ckoks on an example running a function which calla bringToTop().
This makes an error because Rcmd check runs the examples with the
postscript device, and bringToTop does not make sense with that device.

Howevere, my function is for interactive use, and needs bringToTop. 
How can this be used in examples and still have the possibility to use
the automatic
error checking? I also used par(ask=TRUE) and identify in
examples, but gac
ve up on that. But there is a general problem that the automatic running 
of example code chocks on code which make sense interactively, 
but not in batch mode. How can this be solved?

Also, it would be nice if the control of exampkles would not stop
on the first error, but control with further examples, to find all
errors in one run.

Use \dontrun{} as described in the  R-exts  manual.

You might want to change the following lines in the perl script "check"
in R's bin directory:

  if(Rsystem($cmd)) {
    $log->error("running examples failed");
    exit(1);
  }

Is this a bug?

 1 NA 
 1  3 

It has some annoying consequences, e.g.

> median( matrix(1:9,nc=3,dimnames=list(1:3,1:3))[1,,drop=F] )
NA 
 4

The above was for 

Version:
 platform = sparc-sun-solaris2.7
 arch = sparc
 os = solaris2.7
 system = sparc, solaris2.7
 status = 
 major = 1
 minor = 3.0
 year = 2001
 month = 06
 day = 22
 language = R


The behavior seems to differ slightly in 1.3.1.

On Windows 1.3.1  

 matrix(1:9,nc=3,dimnames=list(1:3,1:3))[ cbind(1:3,1:3) ]

omits the names (as is my preference).

Perhaps a clearer example is

> a[1]
A
1

B
2

It's at least a wart that you sometimes get the row names and sometimes
NA.  OTOH it's not clear what the names of a vector extracted from a
matrix *should* be if the vector isn't a single row or column.

Use interactive() in your code to not use code that only makes sense
interactively.

You can set options(error) to do that.

Message-ID: <3BC2A1BB.7E2FE27B@durham.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

I know that Kurt is thinking about slimming down the core functions of R
and putting more stuff into libraries.  I was wondering if, as a first
step, thought had been given to re-organising the source code to
separate out the S-language functionality from the base package
functions. I am thinking in particular of the subdirectory src/main
which contains both top-level files such as "memory.c" and base-package
files such as "optim.c".  Would it not be clearer to mount the base
package entirely on src/library and so put the required C files into the
subdirectory src/library/base/src (which currently does not exist)?

Cheers, Jonathan.

Not really.  If base remains a package, then base.so would have always to
be loaded, and no reduction would result.  Also optim() etc are
implemented via .Internal, and at present .Internal functions (and
primitives) are determined by a compiled-in table.  So the net result
would a lot of work, slower loading and probably a net increase in the
size of the running image.

It seems to me that slimming-down will only work (well) once we can split
base into a number of sub-packages which are auto-loaded as needed (not
necessarily by the autoload mechanism), and namespaces will be useful when
going along that route.   Most of the space we could save is R code, not
compiled C code.   I introduced modules to save much of the latter.

Brian

Hmm. This is a consequence of

> x[[2]]<- letters[1:2]
Error: more elements supplied than there are to replace

which S-PLUS does differently. However, I'm not sure we really want
this to change for the following reason:

> x<-NULL
> x[[2]]<- letters[1:2]
> x
$"":
NULL

$value:
[1] "a" "b"

> x<-NULL
> x[[2]]<-"1"
> x
[1] ""  "1"

Now what does this do if the array extent has length 1?

>  x <- matrix(1:2,2)
>  dimnames(X)[[2]] <- "a"
Problem in dimnames(X) <- .A0: Component 2 of dimnames has length 1, should be 2

Phillipe,

As Thomas noted, R does not currently allow testing whether a function is
being debugged.  However, it is possible to add this feature.  I'm attaching
a patch to the end of this message that adds a new internal function
"isdebug" which tests if its (only) argument is a function with debugging
enabled.

It can be used by:

	> f <- function() 1
	> isdebug(f)
	[1] FALSE
	> debug(f)
	> isdebug(f)
	[1] TRUE	

Using this, it is simple construct a function that gets a list of current
objects and uses isdebug to determine which are functions with debugging
enabled:

	> listdebug <- function(envir=globalenv())
	+   {
	+     test <- function(x) 
	+       { 
	+         fun <- get(x)
	+         if(is.function(fun))
	+           return( isdebug(x) )
	+         else
	+           return(FALSE)
	+       }
	+ 
	+     fnames <- objects(envir=envir)
	+     flag <- sapply(fnames, test)
	+     if(length(flag)>0)
	+       fnames[flag]
	+     else
	+       NULL
	+   }
	> 
	> x <- 7
	> y <- 8
	> f <- function() 1
	> g <- function() 2
	> 
	> debug(f)
	> 
	> ls()
	[1] "f"         "g"         "listdebug" "test"      "x"         "y"

	> 
	> listdebug()
	[1] "f"
	> 
	>

I think there is a problem when computing Pearson residuals, in that they seem
to be computed at the raw residuals divided by the square root of the
corresponding diagonal element of the weight matrix W evaluated at the last step
of the iterative model fitting procedure (IWLS), instead of dividing by the
square root of the model variance. Here's an example of the weird effects it
produces:

> me <- c(1:100)/2
> y <- rpois(100,me)
> yglm <- glm(y~me-1, family=poisson(link="identity"))
> plot(fitted(yglm), residuals(yglm,type="response"))
 
plots the raw residuals... but
 
> plot(fitted(yglm), residuals(yglm,type="pearson"))
 
plots the raw residuals MULTIPLIED by sqrt(fitted(yglm))... because it
computes the Pearson residuals dividing by the square root of the diagonal
element of the weight matrix W (at the end of the iterative fitting process)
rather than dividing by the sqrt of variance.

Um, right... At the very least, there's a "/" that should have been
"*". But do we also divide by the dispersion (when it is estimated)? I
forget what the definition says.

I don't think we do divide by the dispersion -- all the flavours of
residual are supposed to be the same for the normal/identity case.

Subject: [Rd] Wrong df in bartlett.test when subsetting data (PR#1124)
Message-ID: <200110101543.RAA01459@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Jens Lund
Version: 1.3.1
OS: Windows
Submission from: (NULL) (194.239.194.210)


When we subset a dataset bartlett.test does not calculate the df correctly:

X <- rnorm(50)     # Generate simulated samples
f <- gl(10,5)      # Generate a factor with 10 levels and
                   # 5 replications of each level

# Works correctly
bartlett.test(X,f) # Correct number of df = 9

# Just use the first 5 levels of f
# Does not work correctly
bartlett.test(X[1:25],f[1:25]) # Should have df = 4, but uses df = 9
bartlett.test(X~f,subset=1:25) # Should have df = 4, but uses df = 9

In version 1.2.2 the problem could be solved by substituting
        k <- nlevels(g)
with    k <- length(unique(g))
(I do not get the R-code in the new version get by typing bartlett.test at the
prompt.)

This might leed to a discussion on whether nlevels should return the number of
attained factor levels or the number of "theoretical" levels:
nlevels(f)       # Returns 10, fine!
nlevels(f[1:25]) # Returns 10, might not be fine; 5 might be the correct
answer.
The same question might be asked for levels, levels(f) versus levels(f[1:25]).
At least the documentation should be clear on this point, which I do not think
it is now. (Perhaps the levels attribute on the factor should be changed for a
subset of the data, but this is probably not an efficient way of doing
things...)

A similar problem also comes up with interactions between factors in unbalanced
designs:
g <- gl(2,40,50)
nlevels(f:g)         # Returns 20
length(unique(f:g))  # Returns 10
table(f,g)           # See the design

This bug has also been seen on version 1.2.2 on Linux, but is reproduced for
this bug report on:

I strongly believe that levels() and nlevels() are doing the right thing
here.  If a variable is a factor with two levels (eg Male & Female) then
it shouldn't stop being a factor with two levels just because you have a
small sample.  In particular, when you have a single observation g[i] it
is still important to know the set of levels it comes from, rather than
just the category it is in.

On http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk/cgi-bin/R pressing "new bug report" returns a new
form. It would, IMHO, be natural to place the "submit bug report" button on this
form *below* the input area for the actual bug report :-)

This is a documented feature: more accurately, newlines matter.  An R
statement is terminated if it is syntactically complete at the end of the
line.

See the reference manual section 10.2.5 for an explicit statement.

Which is listed as Thomas' doing, but I suspect it was discussed
internally, and thus a collective piece of absentmindedness.

What we have in glm.fit is

w <- sqrt((weights[good] * mu.eta.val[good]^2)/variance(mu)[good])

which later gets squared before it is returned, so the weights are
essentially 

mu.eta.val^2/variance(mu) 

which is what you are saying since the link derivatives are the
"backwards" d(mu)/d(eta). The thing that is confusing is that for a
loglinear Poisson model this comes out as mu^2/mu = mu. AFAIR, similar
cancellation happens in all canonical GLIMs.

For the identity link, it comes out as 1/mu, which is why it seemingly
worked to switch from divide to multiply....

(And of course in ordinary weighted regression, the weights *are* 
usually the reciprocal variances.)

Cc'ed to r-bugs, hoping that someone with a clear mind will do the
right thing...

Yes, in response to a previous bug report (?Atkinson) pointing out that
the old version was wrong when the link function was monotone decreasing
(Gamma/reciprocal).  It wasn't a confusion of * and /, it was a deeper
absentmindedness.

We can't just use $weights, although it does work for canonical links. We
need (y-mu)/sqrt(prior.weights*variance(mu))

Subject: [Rd] unary "-" doesn't convert logicals (PR#1127)
Message-ID: <200110112212.AAA14833@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: John M. Heumann
Version: 1.3.0
OS: Windows NT4/SP5
Submission from: (NULL) (192.25.140.108)


If unary "-" is applied to a logical vector, the resulting value
is computed correctly (i.e. coerced to a numeric), but the type
(incorrectly) remains logical: 

> x <- 1:10
> p1 <- (x > 5)
> p2 <- (-p1)
> is.logical(p2)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(p2)
[1] FALSE
> as.numeric(p1)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
> as.numeric(p2)
 [1]  0  0  0  0  0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Since "==" always does binary comparison, this can lead to
some bizarre behavior:

> p1
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> p2
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> (p1 == p2)
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
((!p1) == (!p2))
 [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

It was not a problem because 1.3.1 gave the wrong answer!  In 1.3.1 on a
postscript device, the background was not painted if white (the default),
but col=0 did paint white.  So the background colour was really
transparent, but col=0 was white.

In 1.4.0 white and transparent are distinct, and you can now set
transparent via an inline `col' setting.  (It was only allowed for direct
setting by par when you made the report.)

The issue was not col=0, but the colour that corresponded to.  Plotting in
col=0 is a lot less useful now, since it often does nothing.

Yup, that's a bug.

I wonder how long it has been around. The function definition is

> get("names<-.dist")
function (d, n) 
{
    if (length(n) != attr(d, "Size")) 
        stop("invalid names for dist object")
    attr(d, "Labels") <- n
    d
}

but the value is passed as a named argument called "value", and it has
been like that for ages.  The fix is obvious: replace "n" with "value"

Subject: [Rd] MASS: isoMDS and sammon
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0110122336360.560-100000@kleigh.nl>


If tbl is an object of class 'dist', you can do this:

    a <- sammon(tbl, k=3)


But you can't do this:

    b <- isoMDS(tbl, k=3)


Wouldn't it be sensible to have identical interfaces to sammon()
and isoMDS() ?

I think all that would be needed is to change this:

  isoMDS <- function(d, y=cmdscale(d, 2), maxit=50, trace=TRUE)
  {

...into this:

  isoMDS <- function(d, y, k=2, maxit=50, trace=TRUE)
  {
    if(missing(y)) y <- cmdscale(d, k=k)

Actually, it should work if you simply define the arguments as 

isoMDS <- function(d, y=cmdscale(d, k), k=2, maxit=50, trace=TRUE)

Default arguments can refer to each other and even to items calculated
inside the function.

You don't need to change anything to use dimensions other than 2 (and the
author of pcurve didn't realise this either, it seems).

Just call isoMDS with a k-dimensional start, as the help page says.
One reason for not making this easy is that the starting configuration
is critical and often one can do better than the default, particularly in
higher dimensions.  (Use the results of sammon(), for example, whihc is one
reason why they might need different interfaces.)

Both sammon and isoMDS are about 9 years old (predating MASS), and started
life in different S library sections.  I will not change the interfaces now
(and both proposals would break positional matching).  (They have
maxit vs niter too.)

I will write a test for this when I find some time ...

When I try to start RGUI, it generates an error in application and R chashs.
(NOTE: R worked very well with trial version of Windows 2000!)

Here is the (not very informative form me) Dr Watson's report:

Subject: [Rd] creating packages for Mac
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110150853460.20787-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  OK, a boneheaded question ...

  I've made a set of packages for my students.
  I'm serving these packages from my web site in the form of a set of
tar.gz source packages (constructed with R CMD build) and a set of .zip
Windows binary packages, constructed by cross-compiling according to Brian
Ripley's instructions (make pkg-foo in the src/gnuwin32 directory) and
then zipping up the directories.
  Now I'm wondering what to do for my students with Macs (besides insist
that they work on PCs).  For the most part my packages *don't* really
contain compiled binary information, and I'm not really planning on trying
to cross-compile Mac binaries on Linux (ugh).  All I really want to do is
provide the packages in a form that the students can unzip (or whatever)
reasonably simply.  I could try to look at the form in which the Mac stuff
is provided and replicate that file structure (which would also mean
finding a Linux application to create Stuffit archives), but I'm not sure
where to start.
  I guess the other possibility is convincing one of my students to
download the machinery for creating binary from source packages on their
machines.

  Any ideas?  Has anyone done this?

 Ben

I seem to recall a recommendation regarding a location for including
extra documentation in packages, but I cannot find it now. Where in a
package should I include a pdf file with a users' guide?

Thanks,
Paul Gilbert

My recommendation would be

	inst/doc/foo.pdf

If you don't need to compile binaries you should just give the .zip 
archives to your students and they will work fine under R for MacOS.

If you need to compile .C of fortran sources you need the "machinery" as 
on any other platform.

In the latest R-devel archive there are MPW makefiles that you can use 
to build mac binaries yourself. For the time being, I can help you in 
compiling sources and prepeare the script files. Let me know.

Regards,

			Stefano

Subject: [Rd] possible bugs: boundary conditions and random distribution parameters
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0110151554240.22158-100000@bolker.zoo.ufl.edu>


  There are a few inconsistencies, at least, in some of the functions that
generate random deviates from particular distributions (I think they're
bugs because they're inconvenient, but maybe someone can make an argument
for the current behavior).  If people think these are really bugs I can
submit them, together or separately.

1. rlnorm(n,mean,sd) gives NaN for sd=0, rather than always returning
the mean.  This is inconsistent with rnorm(), which returns the mean.

2. rnbinom(n,prob,size) gives NaN when prob=1; always returning 0 would be
reasonable, and consistent with the output of dnbinom().  [This is
equivalent to rnbinom(n,mu=0,size) in the new parameterization.]

3. rgamma(n,shape,scale) happily returns 0 when shape=0.  However,
dgamma(x,shape=0) [and pgamma(x,shape=0)] gives NaN.  This behavior is
actually convenient for me, but I could make an argument for returning a
warning in this case.

  The fixes seem straightforward.

Subject: [Rd] plot function
Message-ID: <3BCC374F.7D553701@umsanet.edu.bo>

Hola!

It is somewhat inconvenient to use plot.function, when add=TRUE.

The following (miniscule) change makes it behave better:

 plot.function <-
function (fn, from , to, xlim = NULL, ...) 
{
    if (!is.null(xlim)) {
        if (missing(from)) 
            from <- xlim[1]
        if (missing(to)) 
            to <- xlim[2]
    }
    curve(fn, from, to, xlim = xlim, ...)
}

The only change is that the default arguments fro from and to
are omitted. (curve() has better code to give sensible defaults)

But this makes problems for curve when add=FALSE is used.

The following miniscule changes to curve restores its behaviour when
add=FALSE: (changes only local to the delay() expression)

curve <- 
function (expr, from, to, n = 101, add = FALSE, type = "l", ylab = NULL, 
    log = NULL, xlim = NULL, ...) 
{
    sexpr <- substitute(expr)
    if (is.name(sexpr)) {
        fcall <- paste(sexpr, "(x)")
        expr <- parse(text = fcall)
        if (is.null(ylab)) 
            ylab <- fcall
    }
    else {
        if (!(is.call(sexpr) && match("x", all.vars(sexpr), nomatch =
0))) 
            stop("'expr' must be a function or an expression containing
'x'")
        expr <- sexpr
        if (is.null(ylab)) 
            ylab <- deparse(sexpr)
    }
    lims <- if (is.null(xlim)) 
        delay({
            if (add) {
            pu <- par("usr")[1:2] } else
            pu <- c(0,1)
            if (par("xlog")) 
                10^pu
            else pu
        }, environment())
    else xlim
    if (missing(from)) 
        from <- lims[1]
    if (missing(to)) 
        to <- lims[2]
    lg <- if (length(log)) 
        log
    else paste(if (add && par("xlog")) 
        "x", if (add && par("ylog")) 
        "y", sep = "")
    x <- if (lg != "" && "x" %in% strsplit(lg, NULL)[[1]]) {
        if (any(c(from, to) <= 0)) 
            stop("`from' & `to' must be > 0      with  log=\"x\"")
        exp(seq(log(from), log(to), length = n))
    }
    else seq(from, to, length = n)
    y <- eval(expr, envir = list(x = x), enclos = parent.frame())
    if (add) 
        lines(x, y, type = type, ...)
    else plot(x, y, type = type, ylab = ylab, xlim = xlim, log = lg, 
        ...)
}

In the following special case, seq fails to give the right answer
(which is  0 )

> seq(0,0,1)
Error in if (dd < sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)) return(from) : 
	missing value where logical needed

For any other equal  from  and  to , it works:

> seq(1,1,1)
[1] 1

The error occurs in the statement

            dd <- abs(del)/max(abs(to), abs(from))

of  seq.default  -- for obvious reasons. 
This is certainly easy to debug...

Thank you for your efforts.

Full_Name: John M. Heumann
Version: 1.3.1

Submission from: (NULL) (192.25.140.108)


Picture 2 scenarios:
   (I) R command window sitting at prompt (no program executing)
      a) Do close action: "X" icon, or Alt-F4, or right click on RGui icon
         and select close.
      b) "Save workspace image" dialog appears.
      c) Press cancel. Program does not exit. This is all correct.

   (II) As in (I) but with a program running in the command window
        (e.g. 'source "foo.r"').
        Perform a), b), c) as above. Once again, RGui does not exit
        (which is correct). However the running program will be terminated
        as if you'd hit Escape, which is not correct. I suspect the
"Esc/Cancel"
        message is being passed on up to RGui, rather than trapped and 
        handled by the dialog.

OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

EMRG from $ .60 to $2.50 in 10 days for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!!!
DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)
BUY AT $1.80
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !!!!

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
NEXT WEEK FOR ROYA !!!

Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted financial
services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher this year due to 9
Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, placing rates at their
lowest levels in almost 4 decades.

ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real estate
sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is on with rates
having dropped to bargain basement levels.

We are expecting significant news next week regarding increasing
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing the bottom line for
rapid revenue growth.  The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think
the stock could easily climb above $6 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS ROYA MAY
VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!

Sorry to jump in rather late on a topic which is bordering off topic
but if Debian people are interested I was working for a while distributing
Linux in Australia and I'm still in touch with the industry, I'll point
out a few observations:

* Debian `potato' CDs were popular when they came out but now they are far 
  too out of date to sell.

* Distributers don't want to make up their own unofficial Debian CDs they
  want something complete, tested and ready to stamp CDs.

* The various minibook/pocketbooks have are always popular and I don't think
  that Debian has ever been included on one of these (various combinations
  of RedHat, Mandrake, and TurboLinux have been).

* The RedHat 7.1 CDs (GPL set) are still popular and the `PowerTools' CD
  includes R-base-1.2.0 and RedHat now have quite low prices on their 
  low-end offerings so people aren't being scared off by the boxed-set premium.

Basically the Australian market is very interested in getting distributions
on CD because not many people have the tinme and money to download the entire
Debian sid down a modem. This is not in any way a comment on the quality of
the Debian product but an observation that current Debian packaging is not
doing much for the distribution of that product.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

Unfortunately it seems that RH7.2 will have no PowerTools, but only
the "most important" items from it rolled into the main distribution,
*not* including R (it's not in the beta anyway). On the other hand,
the PowerTools distros have been persistently out of date...

Mandrake 8.2 has R version 1.3.0 as far as I remember.

Subject: [Rd] cex/col/etc. in title(): documentation? (PR#1136)
Message-ID: <200110221551.RAA09762@pubhealth.ku.dk>


  There appears to be a mismatch between the documentation and behavior of
title(), or at least a clarification is in order.  The documentation says
you can pass extra arguments from par() as "...".  However, cex at least
is ignored. Later on in the documentation it becomes clear that you can
specify these extra parameters as part of a list.

  I wouldn't say this is necessarily a bug (and there's certainly a way to
do what you want, if you read the rest of the documentation), but I will
say it didn't seem to follow the same conventions as most of the rest of
the graphical annotation in R.  I would have expected
title(main="foo",cex=2) to set the title larger ...

  I think it would be nicer if title() worked this way, but if it doesn't
it would be nice to have an additional note in the documentation for "..."
to the effect that parameters such as cex, col, etc., should be set using
the list mechanism described below.

## setting parameter with par(): works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  par(cex=i)
  title(main="hello")
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing parameter as part of a list: works
par(mfrow=c(3,3),cex=1)
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main=list("hello",cex=i))
  par(cex=1)
}

## passing cex as an additional arg: doesn't work
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot(0:5)
  title(main="hello",cex=i)
}

Hi, all,

   I swear, bug.report() ate my message!  Apologies to all, esp. Peter who
will once again have to clean up after my mess...

   The bug report was supposed to say:

R> round(100000/3, -2) - 33300
   [1] -7.275958e-12

I would have hoped for 0.  The problem seems to be specifically for negative
"digits".

^^^^^^^^
I can duplicate this under Windows R1.3.0 but not Debian R1.3.1, so it may
have been fixed.  Looking at the changes to arithmetic.c I don't see why,
though.

I would have hoped for 0.  The problem seems to be specifically for negative
"digits".  This is in 1.3.1 on Solaris 2.6 (full description at bottom).

[Apologies for making everyone read this 3 times; my bug.report() burped.]

Peter Dalgaard <p.dalgaard@biostat.ku.dk> says the problem is in fround.c,
which reads in part:
    pow10 = R_pow_di(10., dig)
    ...
    return sgn * (intx + R_rint(x * pow10) / pow10);
and (says Peter),
> the problem is most likely that pow10 (== 1/100) has no finite binary
> representation. Patches are welcome...

I'm not up to patching C code, but I will say that a workaround is:
R> round(round(100000/3, -2)) - 33300
   [1] 0
and a smarter C-programmer could probably implement this concept:
if digits < 0, force the final result to an integer.

It's an accuracy issue, still there in 1.3.1 for Solaris 7. Basically,
dividing by 10^-2 does not always give an integer on SPARC, so we
should be more careful with the logic in fround.c. Beats me why it
would act up on windows, but, well, ...

Subject: [Rd] Possible bug, Rprof() and scan(pipe()) (PR#1140)
Message-ID: <200110232051.WAA27074@pubhealth.ku.dk>

This looks like a bug?
Unable to use scan(pipe()) while profiling.
I have no idea whether this version of R violates the
    "do not use `Rprof' in an executable built for profiling"
warning in ?Rprof.

Thanks

Well, Doug recently paid the dues for r-project.org and
cran.us.r-project.org is working OK from here. Some joker may have
hijacked some name servers though.

Yeah ... it is doing that where I work but not from my ISP. Life in the
digital age, I guess ... I was going to volunteer to pay a year or two
if it really *had* expired, since I don't have time to contribute any *code*.

I just bought two more domains myself; they're *really* cheap these days if
all you want is to have them point somewhere.

Subject: [Rd] broken build with LDFLAGS (PR#1141)
Message-ID: <200110240928.LAA02209@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Denis Sunko
Version: 1.3.1
OS: HP-UX 11.0
Submission from: (NULL) (161.53.2.114)


I invoked configure by

env LDFLAGS=/opt/fortran90/lib ./configure --with-f77=f90

Problem: although configure completed to (its own) satisfaction, the LDFLAGS
information was not propagated everywhere; I had to change the line

PKG_LIBS =   -l:libF90.a -lcl -lisamstub

to

PKG_LIBS =   -L/opt/fortran90/lib -l:libF90.a -lcl -lisamstub

in the files

src/library/ctest/src/Makefile
src/library/modreg/src/Makefile
src/library/mva/src/Makefile
src/library/ts/src/Makefile

by hand.

------
On the wish-list level (not really a bug): it would be nice if configure broke
with a less cryptic message than `f90 and gcc do not agree on int and double',
when all that happens is that it cannot find the fortran library. I suggest
putting -l:libF90.a on the compiler line of a previous (dummy) test program,
just to check for this.

After building and installing R 1.3.1, i find some of the html files missing:

> ls -l /opt/lib/R/doc/manual/
total 0
-rw-r--r--   1 root       sys              0 Oct 17 22:16 R-FAQ.html

-rw-r--r--   1 root       sys              0 Oct 17 22:16 R-lang.html

I can trace this to the lines

.texi.html:
        $(MAKEINFO) --no-split --html -I$(srcdir) $< -o $@ || touch $@

in the file

doc/manual/Makefile

where MAKEINFO is defined (in the same file)

MAKEINFO = false

(correctly, because I don't have the info system installed).

The html files for the packages are all built correctly. The final front
(index)
page for the html documentation also has broken links to various COPYING,
THANKS,
etc. pages.

Well, those files are based on texinfo sources. Without the makeinfo
program you're not going to get them built...

(This is orthogonal to having the info *reader* system installed).

so here goes!  I've only tested it stand-alone, not compiled into the full R
system.  I handle the 3 cases dig=0, dig>0, and dig<0 separately, and note I
avoid a call to R_pow_di altogether in the common case of dig=0.  Hope this is
useful.

Is this still an issue to this community?  If so, and results, I may pick
this up.  Intel does have C++ and Fortran compilers.

You might see a compiler among the list under the links
http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/topic.jsp?catCode=BON.
Evaluation licenses are available at 
http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/

If they are promising, perhaps binaries could at least be built using Intel
compilers.  

But first, are there any R tasks/workloads that we might comparably
benchmark?

Under what OS?

AFAIK the only thing one can do is to find a compiler that optimizes for
the P4, but I don't know of one, nor if it actually helps.  As far as I am
aware under both Linux and Windows the binary versions of R are not
even optimized for an i686 (Pentium Pro/II/III), but I find that under
Windows (and VC++) using the optimizations for i686 makes only negligible
differences.

An easily evaluated benchmark of R performance on Unix/Linux systems
is obtained by running "make check" after building from the sources.
I know there is a similar check done for compilations under Windows
but I don't know how it is run.

"make check" runs every example in every help page in every package
that is shipped with R.  The base package contains the most important
and most commonly used functions.  If everything is successful the
last few lines of the file ./tests/Examples/base-Ex.Rout should read
like

 > cat("Time elapsed: ", proc.time() - get("ptime", env = .CheckExEnv),"\n")
 Time elapsed: 84.22 1.9 105.61 0.82 0.61
 > dev.off(); quit('no')
 null device
           1
The times, in seconds, are the user time, the system time, and
the elapsed (wall clock) time for the parent process, and elapsed and
system times for child processes.  The user time for the parent
process is probably the most important.

The run shown above is for the r-devel sources on a Linux system with
a 1.2 GHz Athlon and 1 GB of PC-133 memory.  The compilers were gcc
and g77 from the 2.95.4 compiler suite.  This compiled version does
use atlas BLAS but that should not make much of a difference on this
benchmark.

Subject: [Rd] Problem testing R version 1.3.1 (PR#1143)
Message-ID: <200110261542.RAA02442@pubhealth.ku.dk>

   I have compiled R version 1.3.1 on a Linux system.  No errors or
warnings are reported.

  However, "make check" fails thus:

=====
make[5]: Leaving directory
`/proj/informatics-build/GML/R/R-1.3.1/src/library'
running code in base-Ex.R ...
../../bin/R --vanilla < base-Ex.R > base-Ex.Rout
make[4]: *** [base-Ex.Rout] Error 139
=====

   The base-Ex.Rout being produced at this point ends with:

=====
> ## 1-d tables
> (Poiss.tab <- table(N = rpois(200, lam= 5)))
N
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 18
 1  4 14 21 46 40 24 14 19 11  3  2  1
=====

   Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the problem may be?


   The configuration parametsr used are:

environment parameters:

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-O2
FC='g77 -L/usr/central/lib'
FFLAGS=-O2
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/common/include
LIBS=-L/usr/central/lib

./configure --prefix=/proj/informatics-build/GML/R/Linux-ia32 \
   --without-readline --without-tcltk --without-gnome


(An equivalent build on an SGI Irix6.5 system also compiles, with
various warnings, but then fails to paas the checks either, but fails on
a later script).

Unfortunately, the output is buffered so that one on catastrophic
error will lose the last bit. It might be more informative if you ran the
command directly, without the redirection to base-Ex.Rout.

No,
but since you're on Linux you can find much more yourself :
Run R inside the debugger:

cd tests/Examples
../../bin/R -d gdb

 and then in (gdb) 

r --vanilla < base-Ex.R

 and it will (hopefully) stop at the same place
 but you'll see more

Odd. There are known issues with stock RH 6.2, but base R usually
compiles and passes make check on those systems. What usually happens
is that some packages refuse to dynload, with the error you're
observing, essentially.

The culprit is somewhere in the compiler suite - 2.95.x is known to
work, and I believe 3.0.x too (whereas the unofficial 2.96 from RH 7.0
caused trouble although later ones for 7.1 and 7.2 seem OK). You might
as well upgrade since R-1.4.0 will definitely not work with that
setup.

We've seen this one before. It's usually due to a problem with the Fortran
compile or flags such as linking in a math library compiled with different
flags from R.

   Confirmed.  I've just found a Mandarke7.2 system with gcc 2.95.2 on,
and that passes the check (as does the RH6.2 system when using these
same binaries).

   Thanks.

   Now to track down the SGI problem....(which is already using gcc
2.95.2).

Message-ID: <200110261805.UAA03272@pubhealth.ku.dk>

   I've compiled R verison 1.3.1 on SGI Irix 6.5

   It fails its check when running the ts-Ex.Rout test with:

=====
>

Error in ar.yw.mts(x, aic = aic, order.max = order.max, na.action =
na.action,  : 
        On entry to DGEMM  parameter number 1 had an illegal value
Execution halted
=====

   It was compiled with gcc 2.95.2 (and the g77 which came with that,
which is 0.5.25).

Subject: [Rd] promax rotation matrix (PR#1146)
Message-ID: <200110261844.UAA03434@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Peter Perkins

Submission from: (NULL) (144.212.95.125)


I believe that line 15 in promax from the mva library is incorrect. It currently
reads
    U <- U %*% xx$rotmat
and I believe it should be 
    U <- xx$rotmat %*% U

I could easily be wrong about this, what with the different definitions of the
rotation matrix vs. its transpose or its inverse.  But as I read the help page,
the rotation returned should be the one right-applied to the unrotated loadings.
 If one gets an unrotated solution from factanal, and then rotates it using
promax, the rotation matrix returned by promax does not rotate the original
loadings to the loadings actually returned by promax.  For example:

> ability.FA <- factanal(factors = 2, covmat = ability.cov, rotation = "none")
> pm <- promax(ability.FA$loadings)
> ability.FA$loadings %*% pm$rotmat

I believe that the latter is correct.  Changing the order of the product in line
15 makes the two the same.

I reported this earlier, and have got reports that others have the same
promlem on UNIX machines, so it is not only a windows problem
S I file a bug report.

The function (boot.stat) given at the end produces a postscript file, 
which cannot be included correctly in LaTeX. Specifically, 
the image in LaTeX (when translated by dvips to postscript)
becomes very small, not using the bounding box, and turned on its head!

Subject: [Rd] warnings --- wish/bug (PR#1148)
Message-ID: <200110261927.VAA03569@pubhealth.ku.dk>

When R prints warnings, they often go "out of the line", it would be
better if they where wrapped with
writeLines(strwrap ...

I tried to do that , changing the function warnings, but it has only
effect when called explicitely, not when R prints the warnings unasked.

Anyhow, here is the changed warnings:

warnings <-
function (...) 
{
    if (!(n <- length(last.warning))) 
        return()
    names <- names(last.warning)
    cat("Warning message", if (n > 1) 
        "s", ":\n", sep = "")
    for (i in 1:n) {
        out <- if (n == 1) 
            names[i]
        else paste(i, ": ", names[i], sep = "")
        if (length(last.warning[[i]])) {
            temp <- deparse(last.warning[[i]])
            out <- paste(out, "in:", temp[1], if (length(temp) > 
                1) 
                " ...")
        }
        writeLines(strwrap(out), ...)
    }
}

This is difficult.  The internal warnings should work as often as
possible without doing memory allocation, which might provoke an error
(*and* we try to print out warnings after a memory allocation error).
So strwrap is a no-no internally.

I've not seen warnings that are not wrapped by the console
(on Unix) or are scrollable (Rgui).   Can you give us an example of the
problem?

Incidentally, I think you want to strwrap the ... too.

That's bad design, but you can scroll the RGui window, surely?

BTW, that's nothing to do with warnings().  The internal code assumes that
the author has used sensible line lengths in the call to warning (R or C)
or warningcall (C).

I tested this. There is definitely something wrong with the
PostScript output. The first command that is called that does
something in the graphics state is 'cl', and this command starts
with a 'grestore'. So, there is a call to 'grestore' in the
PostScipt file that was not preceeded by a call to 'gsave'. The
result is the undoing of a 'gsave' in the embedding code.

I compared the PostScript code to the code that was generated
with another graphic that didn't cause any problemns. Seems that
what is missing in the defective code is a call to 'bp' at the
start. Inserting this command before the first call to 'cl'
fixes the problem.

Why 'bp' is missing is something someone else should figure out.

Thanks for the analysis. For debugging, the following minimal example
may be helpful

b<-
function () 
{
    split.screen(c(1, 2))
    screen(1)
    plot(0)
}
b();postscript();b();dev.off()

notice that it will not happen unless you plot to the screen first.

Subject: [Rd] psignrank and pwilcox null pointer deref (PR#1149)
Message-ID: <200110262150.XAA04192@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Full_Name: Charles J. Geyer
Version: 1.3.1
OS: SuSE 7.2
Submission from: (NULL) (134.84.86.22)


in line 90 of signrank.c and lines 114 and 273 of wilcox.c calloc is used and
the return is not checked to see if it is null (violating numbers 2 and 6 of
the ten commandments for C programmers).  The following code thus makes
R segfault (for suitably large values of 1000)

for (n in seq(100, 1000, 100)) {
   mu <- n * (n + 1) / 4
   sigma <- sqrt(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 24)
   z <- floor(qnorm(0.05, mu, sigma))
   p <- psignrank(z, n)
   cat("z = ", z, ", n = ", n, ", p = ", p, "\n", sep="")
}

for (n in seq(100, 1000, 100)) {
   m <- n
   mu <- n * m / 2
   sigma <- sqrt(m * n * (m + n + 1) / 12)
   z <- floor(qnorm(0.05, mu, sigma))
   p <- pwilcox(z, m, n)
   cat("z = ", z, ", m = ", m, ", n = ", n, ", p = ", p, "\n", sep="")
}

A fix is hard because a good solution would free all the previously allocated
memory before dying.  Probably a better algorithm is needed.  But I don't know
if one exists.

Anyway the current behavior is unacceptable.

The note to 1004 says "fixed for 1.3.1"

Uh.  No.  It ain't.

The problem was more serious than guessed as even the simplest testing
would show.

For example, Example 5.4 in Hollander and Wolfe (Nonparametric Statistical,
Methods, 2nd ed., Wiley, 1999, pp. 180-181)

R Version 1.3.1 (SuSE Linux 7.1)

> X <- read.table(url("http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/5601/hwdata/t5-7.txt"),
+     header = TRUE)
> names(X)
[1] "x" "y"
> attach(X)
> ks.test(x, y)
 
        Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
data:  x and y
D = 0.6, p-value = 0.01234
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

Not hardly.  Hollander and Wolfe say the exact P-value is 0.0524.  Note

> ks.test(x, y, exact = FALSE)
 
        Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
data:  x and y
D = 0.6, p-value = 0.05465
alternative hypothesis: two.sided

Agrees.  Thus the algorithm for the exact null distribution of the two-sample
K-S test statistic is erroneous.  I. e., there is something wrong with the
function "psmirnov2x" in ks.c.  I don't yet know what the problem is.

Here's part of the problem:

Browse[1]> .C("psmirnov2x", p = as.double(STATISTIC), as.integer(n.x),
as.integer(n.y), PACKAGE = "ctest")$p
[1] 0.9876594

as.integer(n.y), PACKAGE = "ctest")$p
[1] 0.9475524
Browse[1]> STATISTIC
[1] 0.6

Perplexed? The reason is of course that

Browse[1]> STATISTIC-0.6
[1] 1.110223e-16

and the KS distribution is discontinuous, so the point probability at
0.6 didn't get counted. Looks like we need a fudge factor.

Subject: [Rd] wilcox.test point estimates perverse (PR#1150)
Message-ID: <200110262309.BAA04442@pubhealth.ku.dk>

The point estimates produced by wilcox.test are perverse (not wrong, just
brain damaged).  The Hodges-Lehmann estimator that goes with the signed
rank test is the median of the Walsh averages.  The Hodges-Lehmann estimator
that goes with the rank sum test is the median of the pairwise differences.

wilcox.test agrees except that it uses the following very peculiar definition
of "sample median": if the number of items is even, the average of the two
middle items (agrees with the usual definition), and if the number of items
is odd, the average of the two on either side of the middle item in sorted
order (huh???  why???).  I know this is asymptotically equivalent to the
usual definition, but

  * Why get answers that disagree with every nonparametrics textbook?

  * If wilcox.test is right then median is wrong and should be fixed
    (just kidding, don't mess with median!)

Thus the complicated code in lines 87--89 of wilcox.test.default
should be replaced by the simple

  ESTIMATE <- median(diffs)

and the complicated code in lines 214-216 of wilcox.test.default should
be again be replaced replaced by the simple

  ESTIMATE <- median(diffs)

Moreover, there is NO "correction for ties" in the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.
Thus the code in lines 147-148 and 272-273 is silly.  The code for the point
estimate should be done by exactly the same code when there are ties or zeroes
(or both) and when there are not.  Reference: Sections 3.2 and 4.2 of
Hollander and Wolfe.

I understand that one doesn't want to produce the vector diffs (which is
order n^2 when n is large), but one doesn't have to to calculate the median
if this is taken to C.

Moreover that uniroot stuff sometimes crashes (sorry, I didn't save the
examples, but take my word for it, it's not bulletproof).

Note that the confidence intervals are also bizarre in the case of ties, but
that's another bug report.

For tied samples this estimators may be not inside the confidence sets which
is confusing. Example (from ?wilcox.exact, package exactRankTests):

> treat <- c(94, 108, 110, 90)
> contr <- c(80, 94, 85, 90, 90, 90, 108, 94, 78, 105, 88)
> 
> # StatXact 4 for Windows: p.value = 0.0989, point prob = 0.019
> 
> wilcox.exact(contr, treat, conf.int=T)

        Exact Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  contr and treat 
W = 9, point prob = 0.019, p-value = 0.0989 
alternative hypothesis: true mu is not equal to 0 
95 percent confidence interval:
 -22   4 
sample estimates:
difference in location 
                    13 		<- when computed with median(diffs)

For compatibility between the 2 versions of the Wilcoxon-Test, 
we use the basic definition: 

  d_1 = sup {d | W(d) > E(W) }
  d_2 = inf {d | W(d) < E(W) }

  Hodges-Lehmann = mean(d1,d2)

(using max and min instead of sup and inf which causes the difference).
However, this may be questionable ...

wilcox.test uses the normal approximation when 

a) the sample sizes are large or
b) ties occur.

computing all differences when a) is not feasible (taking it to C does not
improve `outer(x,y,"-")' significantly). Therefore, we
use uniroot for searching d with W(X - d, Y) = E(W).

In case b) in `wilcox.test' the normal
approximation is used for p-values and confidence intervals, it seems
natural to me to compute the point estimator the way the conf ints are
computed. Additionally median(diffs) may lie outside the confidence set
in this situation (see above).

Because the normal approximation is bizzare for small, tied samples? 
That is what `wilcox.exact' is for.

Hi,
I need to append one vector to another in C. I have this little test
program that crashes is this not what append is for? 

#include<R.h>
#include<Rinternals.h>

SEXP apt(SEXP a, SEXP b){

  SEXP ans;
  PROTECT(ans = append(a,b));
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);

}

Thanks

There is minus sign missing in the formula for cdf of Logistic distribution.

Instead of

should be

Full_Name: Hsiu-Khuern Tang

Hi,

The current documentation for approx() contains the following paragraph:

       f: For `method="constant"' a number between 0 and 1 inclusive,
          indicating a compromise between left- and right-continuous
          step functions. If `y0' and `y1' are the values to the left
          and right of the point then the value is `y0*f+y1*(1-f)' so
          that `f=0' is right-continuous and `f=1' is left-continuous.

The formula

y0*f+y1*(1-f)

should be

y0*(1-f)+y1*f

This will make it consistent with the claim that "`f=0' is right-continuous and
`f=1' is left-continuous", as well as with the actual code:

approx(1:2, 1:2, xout=1.5, method="constant", f=1)
$x
[1] 1.5

$y
[1] 2

Best,
Hsiu-Khuern.

Thank you, Jan.
A "cut&paste" typo I have fixed for "R-devel" (to be 1.4.0).

Well, I don't get either of those:

[1] "2001-12-12 23:40:00" "2001-12-12 23:50:00" "2001-12-13 00:00:00"
[4] "2001-12-13 00:10:00"

It would be helpful to give the incorrect output that your system gives.
In the output below I see no evidence of `the times wrap'.  Using the
wrong day seems to be a bug in glibc's strptime, but you need to unclass
the strptime result to see this.  (I do see the strptime bug on RH6.2
Linux, where the day field is ignored.)

Yes, but that was not the intention in the original (real) example,
where the year was not specified.

Again, the need was to use `time' after the detach.  This only
occurred because you did not remove the variable your system created
incorrectly.

I will change this to work around a system-specific bug.  I'll pass on to
the Windows maintainer fixing the strptime code used on that platform.

No bug.  Here's the clarification:

Contrary to the other implementations of S,
R differentiates different usages of "cex", "col" and "font" :

 > .Pars[grep("^cex",.Pars)]
 [1] "cex"      "cex.axis" "cex.lab"  "cex.main" "cex.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^col",.Pars)]
 [1] "col"      "col.axis" "col.lab"  "col.main" "col.sub" 
 > .Pars[grep("^font",.Pars)]
 [1] "font"      "font.axis" "font.lab"  "font.main" "font.sub" 

and ?par *does* document this.

Hence the "..." in axis() should really be ``filled'' with cex.axis, etc.

The following is an example demonstrating R's possibilities

plot(1, col.axis = "sky blue", col.lab = "thistle")
title("Main Title", sub = "sub title", 
      cex.main = 2,   font.main= 4, col.main= "blue",
      cex.sub = 0.75, font.sub = 3, col.sub = "red")

I've located the problem, which boils down to inaccuracies in the
following in man strptime:

       The  GNU  libc  implementation does not touch those fields
       which are not directly initialized.   Exceptions  are  the
       tm_wday  and  tm_yday elements which are recomputed if any
       of the year, month, or date elements changed.

As RMH's example shows, it does touch the tm_mon and tm_mday fields if the
year is specified (even if unchanged) but not quite always.

I am writing a workaround for R-devel.  Yet another system-specific
problem with the date-time code!

       Hi,
       The function help.start() assume that the brower is netscape
which is no longer the dominant brower in used. I am using now opera
and other use mozilla or Microsoft IE. I can always type
help.start(browser="opera"), but it is not convenience: I would like
to be able to set the default brwsernone for all. But the real bug is
that even after launching help.start(browser="opera"), other help
commands, help(help), say, still send the "help page" to netscape. Here
is what I get

> help.start(browser="opera")
If opera  is already running,   it is *not* restarted,
 and you must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient..
> help(help)          
help() for help  is shown in browser netscape ...
Use      help( help , htmlhelp=FALSE)
or       options(htmlhelp = FALSE)
to revert.
> sh: netscape: command not found

Please correct this bug.

On what operating system is this?  On Unix/Linux you should be using
options(browser="opera").  On Windows/Mac you can't set the browser
anyway.

See the requirements for a browser in the details under ?help.start.
Neither of those (nor Netscape 6.1) worked when I tried them with -remote.

I don't think it is a bug in R but I have expanded the documentation.

Please do use the bug.report() function, as critical information is
missing from this report.

I am sorry not having looked carefully on the documentation. But the
first thing I do is to launch help.start() and be stuck with an
inexistent browser. I have imagined that help.start(browser="opera")
would set the browser to opera, but I am wrong and the browser must be
set by options(browser="opera"), a feature which I am not aware of.
Nevertheless, I find this rather confusing for a new user: if
options(browser="opera") should always be used to set the browser,
then the argument browser="opera" in help.start would never be needed.

The documentation issue may be unfortunate, but there is really no point
unless we find browsers other than Netscape which can be controlled
remotely.  I have been raising this issue a couple of times, last time
about three months ago or so.  Mozilla then claimed to support -remote
as Netscape does but really did not.  Konqueror does not allow being
sent URLs remotely, and neither does gnome-help-browser.  Not sure about
Opera ... do you have more info?

Subject: [Rd] strptime bug (PR#1155)
Message-ID: <200110312232.XAA20303@pubhealth.ku.dk>

Where is the strptime bug happening?  I am seeing it on W95 W98 W2000
running Rterm under ntemacs 21.1 with ESS 5.1.19 and using cygwin
2001/08/31 15:52:16 Starting cygwin install, version 2.78.2.3

Is strptime using the bash from my system? or is it using functions
that are included with R?

R defaulted to 1900 when I didn't specify a year.  The 1990 came from
the help(beav1).

When I explicitly place a year in the file, either the 1990 inidcated
in the help(beav1) file or the 1900 chosen to match the default, then
R gives me times consistent with the input.
