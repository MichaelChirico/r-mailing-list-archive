CHANGES IN R 4.1.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The default version of Bioconductor has been changed to 3.14.
      (This is used by setRepositories and the menus in GUIs.)

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check --as-cran has a workaround for a bug in versions of
      file up to at least 5.41 which mis-identify DBF files last
      changed in 2022 as executables.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The legacy S-compatibility macros SINGLE_* in R_ext/Constants.h
      (included by R.h) are deprecated and will be removed in R 4.2.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Initialization of self-starting nls() models with initialization
      functions following the pre-R-4.1.0 API (without the ...
      argument) works again for now, with a deprecation warning.

    * Fixed quoting of ~autodetect~ in Java setting defaults to avoid
      inadvertent user lookup due to leading ~, reported in PR#18231 by
      Harold Gutch.

    * substr(., start, stop) <- v now treats _negative_ stop values
      correctly.  Reported with a patch in PR#18228 by Brodie Gaslam.

    * Subscripting an array x without dimnames by a
      length(dim(x))-column character matrix gave "random" non-sense,
      now an error; reported in PR#18244 by Mikael Jagan.

    * ...names() now matches names(list(...)) closely, fixing PR#18247.

    * all.equal(*, scale = s) now works as intended when length(s) > 1,
      partly thanks to Michael Chirico's PR#18272.

    * print(x) for long vectors x now also works for named atomic
      vectors or lists and prints the correct number when reaching the
      getOption("max.print") limit; partly thanks to a report and
      proposal by Hugh Parsonage to the R-devel list.

    * all.equal(<selfStart>, *) no longer signals a deprecation
      warning.

    * reformulate(*, response=r) gives a helpful error message now when
      length(r) > 1, thanks to Bill Dunlap's PR#18281.

    * Modifying globalCallingHandlers inside withCallingHandlers() now
      works or fails correctly, thanks to Henrik Bengtsson's PR#18257.

    * hist(<Date>, breaks = "days") and hist(<POSIXt>, breaks = "secs")
      no longer fail for inputs of length 1.

    * qbeta(.001, .9, .009) and similar cases now converge correctly
      thanks to Ben Bolker's report in PR#17746.

    * window(x, start, end) no longer wrongly signals "'start' cannot
      be after 'end'", fixing PR#17527 and PR#18291.

    * data() now checks that its (rarely used) list argument is a
      character vector - a couple of packages passed other types and
      gave incorrect results.

    * which() now checks its arr.ind argument is TRUE rather coercing
      to logical and taking the first element - which gave incorrect
      results in package code.

    * model.weights() and model.offset() more carefully extract their
      model components, thanks to Ben Bolker and Tim Taylor's R-devel
      post.

    * list.files(recursive = TRUE) now shows all broken symlinks
      (previously, some of them may have been omitted, PR#18296).

CHANGES IN R 4.2.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * The formula method of aggregate() now matches the generic in
      naming its first argument x (resolving PR#18299 by Thomas
      Soeiro).

      This means that calling aggregate() with a formula as a named
      first argument requires name formula in earlier versions of R and
      name x now, so portable code should not name the argument (code
      in many packages did).

    * Calling && or || with either argument of length greater than one
      now gives a warning (which it is intended will become an error).

    * Calling if() or while() with a condition of length greater than
      one gives an error rather than a warning.  Consequently,
      environment variable _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_ no longer has
      any effect.

    * Windows users should consult the WINDOWS section below for some
      profound changes including

        * Support for 32-bit builds has been dropped.

        * UTF-8 locales are used where available.

        * The default locations for the R installation and personal
          library folder have been changed.

      Thanks to Tomas Kalibera for months of work on the Windows port
      for this release.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * matrix(x, n, m) now warns in more cases where length(x) differs
      from n * m, as suggested by Abby Spurdle and Wolfgang Huber in
      Feb 2021 on the R-devel mailing list.

      This warning can be turned into an error by setting environment
      variable _R_CHECK_MATRIX_DATA_ to TRUE: R CMD check --as-cran
      does so unless it is already set.

    * Function file_test() in package utils gains tests for symlinks,
      readability and writability.

    * capabilities("libxml") is now false.

      The description of capabilities("http/ftp") now reflects that it
      refers to the default method, no longer the internal one.

    * simplify2array() gains an except argument for controlling the
      exceptions used by sapply().

    * Environment variables R_LIBS_USER and R_LIBS_SITE are both now
      set to the R system default if unset or empty, and can be set to
      NULL to indicate an empty list of user or site library
      directories.

    * The warning for axis()(-like) calls in cases of relatively small
      ranges (typically in log-scale situations) is slightly improved
      _and_ suppressed from explicit calls to .axisPars() as has always
      been the intention.

    * The contrasts setter function `contrasts<-` gains an explicit
      default how.many = NULL rather than just using missing(how.many).

    * grid.pretty() gains a new optional argument n = 5.

    * There is a new function .pretty() with option bounds as a
      technical-utility version of pretty().  It and pretty() gain a
      new argument f.min with a better than back-compatible default.

    * Function grDevices::axisTicks() and related functions such as
      graphics::axis() work better, notably for the log scale; partly
      because of the pretty() improvements, but also because care is
      taken e.g., when ylim is finite but diff(ylim) is infinite.

    * nclass.FD() gains a digits option.

    * The R Mathlib internal C function bd0() (called indirectly from a
      dozen probability density and distribution functions such as
      dpois(), dbinom(), dgamma(), pgamma() _etc_) has been
      complemented by a more sophisticated and (mostly) more accurate C
      function ebd0(), currently called only by internal dpois_raw()
      improving accuracy for R level dpois() and potentially others
      calling it such as dnbinom(), dgamma() or pgamma().  (Thanks to
      Morten Welinder's PR#15628.)

    * write.ftable() gains sep = " " argument as suggested by Thomas
      Soeiro.

    * The names of the locale categories supported by R's
      Sys.getlocale() and Sys.setlocale() are now provided by variable
      .LC.categories in the base namespace.

    * The Date and POSIXt methods for hist() and the histogram method
      for plot() now also use the new default col = "lightgray" in
      consistency with the corresponding change to hist()'s default for
      R 4.0.0.

    * hist.default() gains new fuzz argument, and the histogram plot
      method no longer uses fractional axis ticks when displaying
      counts ("Frequency").

    * mapply() and hence Map() now also obey the "max-or-0-if-any"
      recycling rule, such that, e.g., Map(`+`, 1:3, 1[0]) is valid
      now.

    * as.character(<obj>) for "hexmode" or "octmode" objects now
      fulfils the important basic rule as.character(x)[j] ===
      as.character(x[j]).

    * The set utility functions, notably intersect() have been tweaked
      to be more consistent and symmetric in their two set arguments,
      also preserving a common mode.

    * substr(ch, start,end) <- new now e.g., preserves names(ch); ditto
      for substring(), thanks to a patch from Brodie Gaslam.

    * plot(<lm>) gains a extend.ylim.f argument, in partial response to
      PR#15285; further PR#17784 is fixed thanks to several
      contributors and a patch by Elin Waring.  The Cook's dist
      contours get customizable via cook.col and cook.lty with a
      different default color and their legend is nicer by default and
      customizable via cook.legendChanges.

    * Attempting to subset an object that is not subsettable now
      signals an error of class notSubsettableError. The
      non-subsettable object is contained in the object field of the
      error condition.

    * Subscript-out-of-bounds errors are now signaled as errors of
      class subscriptOutOfBoundsError.

    * Stack-overflow errors are now signaled as errors inheriting from
      class stackOverflowError. See ?stackOverflowError for more
      details.

    * New partly experimental Sys.setLanguage() utility, solving the
      main problem of PR#18055.

    * gettext() and gettextf() get a new option trim = TRUE which when
      set to false allows translations for strings such as "Execution
      halted\n" typical for C code.

    * An experimental implementation of hash tables is now available.
      See ?hashtab for more details.

    * identical() gains a extptr.as.ref argument for requesting that
      external pointer objects be compared as reference objects.

    * reorder() gets an argument decreasing which it passes to sort()
      for level creation; based on the wish and patch by Thomas Soeiro
      in PR#18243.

    * as.vector() gains a data.frame method which returns a simple
      named list, also clearing a long standing 'FIXME' to enable
      as.vector(<data.frame>, mode="list").  This breaks code relying
      on as.vector(<data.frame>) to return the unchanged data frame.

    * legend() is now vectorized for arguments cex, x.intersp, and
      text.width.  The latter can now also be specified as a vector
      (one element for each column of the legend) or as NA for
      computing a proper column wise maximum value of strwidth(legend).
      The argument y.intersp can be specified as a vector with one
      entry for each row of the legend.

      legend() also gains new arguments title.cex and title.font.
      Thanks to Swetlana Herbrandt.

    * Deparsing no longer remaps attribute names dim, dimnames, levels,
      names and tsp to historical S-compatible names (which structure()
      maps back).

    * sample() and sample.int() have additional sanity checks on their
      size and n arguments.

      all.equal.numeric() gains a sanity check on its tolerance
      argument - calling all.equal(a, b, c) for three numeric vectors
      is a surprisingly common error.

      mean(na.rm =), rank(na.last =), barplot(legend.text =),
      boxplot(), contour(drawlabels =), polygon(border =) and
      methods::is(class2 =) have more robust sanity checks on their
      arguments.

      R CMD Rd2pdf (used by R CMD check) has a more robust sanity check
      on the format of \alias{} commands.

    * psigamma(x, deriv) for negative x now also works for deriv = 4
      and 5; their underlying C level dpsifn() is documented in
      'Writing R Extensions'.

    * The HTML help system now uses HTML5 (wish of PR#18149).

    * ks.test() now provides exact p-values also with ties and MC
      p-values in the two-sample (Smirnov) case.  By Torsten Hothorn.

    * ks.test() gains a formula interface, with y ~ 1 for the
      one-sample (Kolmogorov) test and y ~ group for the two-sample
      (Smirnov) test.  Contributed by Torsten Hothorn.

    * The return value from ks.test() now has class c("ks.test",
      "htest") - packages using try() need to take care to use
      inherits() and not == on the class.

    * New functions psmirnov(), qsmirnov() and rsmirnov() in package
      stats implementing the asymptotic and exact distributions of the
      two-sample Smirnov statistic.

    * iconv() now allows sub = "c99" to use C99-style escapes for UTF-8
      inputs which cannot be converted to encoding to.

    * In a forward pipe |> expression it is now possible to use a named
      argument with the placeholder _ in the rhs call to specify where
      the lhs is to be inserted.  The placeholder can only appear once
      on the rhs.

    * The included LAPACK sources have been updated to version 3.10.0,
      except for the four Fortran 77 routines which 3.10.0 has
      re-implemented in Fortran 90 (where the older versions have been
      retained as the R build process does not support Fortran 90).

    * path.expand() and most other uses of tilde expansion now warn if
      a path would be too long if expanded.  (An exception is
      file.exists(), which silently returns false.)

    * trunc(<Date>, *) now supports units = "months" or "years" for
      consistency with the POSIXt method, thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel's
      proposal in PR#18099.

    * list2DF() now checks that its arguments are of the same length,
      rather than use recycling.

    * The HTML help system has several new features: LaTeX-like math
      can be typeset using either KaTeX or MathJax, usage and example
      code is highlighted using Prism, and for dynamic help the output
      of examples and demos can be shown within the browser if the
      knitr package is installed. These features can be disabled by
      setting the environment variable _R_HELP_ENABLE_ENHANCED_HTML_ to
      a false value.

  GRAPHICS:

    * The graphics engine version, R_GE_version, has been bumped to 15
      and so packages that provide graphics devices should be
      reinstalled.

    * The grid package now allows the user to specify a "vector" of
      pattern fills.  The fill argument to gpar() accepts a list of
      gradients and/or patterns and the functions linearGradient(),
      radialGradient(), and pattern() have a new group argument.

      Points grobs (data symbols) can now also have a pattern fill.

      The grobCoords() function now returns a more informative and
      complex result.

    * The grid package has new functions for drawing isolated groups:
      grid.group(), grid.define(), and grid.use().  These functions add
      compositing operators and affine transformations to R's graphics
      capabilities.

      The grid package also has new functions for stroking and filling
      paths: grid.stroke(), grid.fill(), and grid.fillStroke().

      A new function as.path() allows the user to specify the fill rule
      for a path that is to be used for clipping, stroking, or filling;
      available options are "winding" and "evenodd".  A new function
      as.mask() allows the user to specify the type of a mask;
      available options are "alpha" and "luminance".

      These new features are only supported so far (at most) on the
      Cairo-based graphics devices and on the pdf() device.

    * dev.capabilities() reports on device support for the new
      features.

    * par() now warns about unnamed non-character arguments to prevent
      misuse such as {usr <- par("usr"); par(usr)}.

  WINDOWS:

    * R uses UTF-8 as the native encoding on recent Windows systems (at
      least Windows 10 version 1903, Windows Server 2022 or Windows
      Server 1903).  As a part of this change, R uses UCRT as the C
      runtime.  UCRT should be installed manually on systems older than
      Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 before installing R.

    * The default personal library on Windows, folder R\win-library\x.y
      where x.y stands for R release x.y.z, is now a subdirectory of
      Local Application Data directory (usually a hidden directory
      C:\Users\username\AppData\Local).  Use shell.exec(.libPaths()[1])
      from R to open the personal library in Explorer when it is first
      in the list (PR#17842).

    * R uses a new 64-bit Tcl/Tk bundle.  The previous 32-bit/64-bit
      bundle had a different layout and can no longer be used.

    * Make files and installer scripts for Windows have been tailored
      to Rtools42, the newly recommended 64-bit gcc 10.3 MinGW-W64 UCRT
      toolchain.

    * Rtools42 by default uses the Windows security features ASLR and
      DEP; hence CRAN builds of R and packages also do.

    * R now supports files Makevars.ucrt, Makefile.ucrt, configure.ucrt
      and cleanup.ucrt in packages, which are used in preference to the
      .win variants.  This allows keeping the .win files around to
      support older versions of R.  This feature will be removed in the
      future once support for older versions of R would no longer be
      needed.

    * R.version gains a new field crt (only on Windows) to denote the C
      runtime.  The value is "ucrt".

    * On Windows, download.file(method = "auto") and url(method =
      "default") now follow Unix in using "libcurl" for all except
      file:// URIs.

    * Rtools42 includes an unpatched Msys2 build of GNU tar.  Paths
      including drive letters can be made to work by adding
      --force-local to environment variable TAR_OPTIONS.  (Rtools40 and
      earlier included a patched version which defaulted to this
      option.)

    * Installer builds of R automatically find the Rtools42 software
      collection as well as the compiler toolchain.  No PATH setting is
      required from the user.

    * The default installation directory of R for a user-only
      installation has been changed to the User Program Files directory
      (usually a hidden directory
      C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs) to follow Windows
      conventions.  Use shell.exec(R.home()) from R to open the R
      installation directory in Explorer (PR#17842).

    * R now supports installation-time patching of packages.  Patches
      may be installed from a supplied URL or a local directory or
      disabled.  Patches are included into the installed packages for
      reference.  This experimental feature may be removed in the
      future.

    * libcurl is now required for building from source.

    * The clipboard connection now works also with text in other than
      the current native encoding (PR#18267, with Hiroaki Yutani).
      Text is always pasted to the clipboard in UTF16-LE and the
      encoding argument is ignored.

    * The internal case-changing functions are now used by default on
      Windows - this circumvents problems (for example with E acute) of
      the UCRT Windows' runtime.

    * R on Windows now uses the system memory allocator.  Doug Lea's
      allocator was used since R 1.2.0 to mitigate performance
      limitations seen with system allocators on earlier versions of
      Windows.

    * memory.limit() and memory.size() are now stubs on Windows (as on
      Unix-alikes).

    * Applications embedding R on Windows can now use additional
      callbacks, which have so far only been available only on Unix
      (PR#18286).

  INSTALLATION:

    * Facilities for accessing ftp:// sites are no longer tested
      (except _pro tem_ for curlGetHeaders()) as modern browsers have
      removed support.

    * R can now be built with DEFS = -DSTRICT_R_HEADERS .

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * R CMD INSTALL no longer tangles vignettes. This completes an R
      CMD build change in R 3.0.0 and affects packages built before R
      3.0.2. Such packages should be re-made with R CMD build to have
      the tangled R code of vignettes shipped with the tarball.

    * USE_FC_LEN_T will become the default: this uses the correct
      prototypes for Fortran BLAS/LAPACK routines called from C/C++,
      and requires adjustment of most such calls - see 'Writing R
      Extensions' SS6.6.2.  (This has been supported since R 3.6.2.)

    * Package installation speed for packages installed with
      keep.source has been improved. This resolve the issue reported by
      Ofek Shilon in PR#18236.

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check can optionally report files/directories left behind
      in home, /tmp (even though TMPDIR is set) and other directories.
      See the "R Internals" manual for details.

    * R CMD check now reports byte-compilation errors during
      installation.  These are not usually fatal but may result in
      parts of the package not being byte-compiled.

    * _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ can be applied selectively to examples,
      tests and/or vignettes in R CMD check: see the "R Internals"
      manual.

    * _R_CHECK_SRC_MINUS_W_IMPLICIT_ now defaults to true: recent
      versions of Apple clang on macOS have made implicit function
      declarations in C into a compilation error.

    * R CMD check --as-cran makes use of the environment variable
      AUTORECONF.  See the "R Internals" manual SS8 for further details.

    * R CMD check --use-valgrind also uses valgrind when re-building
      vignettes as some non-Sweave vignettes unhelpfully comment out
      all their code when R CMD check runs vignettes.

    * Errors in re-building vignettes (unless there are LaTeX errors)
      are reported by R CMD check as ERROR rather than WARNING when
      running vignettes has been skipped (as it frequently is in CRAN
      checks and by --as-cran).

    * R CMD Rd2pdf gains a --quiet option that is used by R CMD build
      when building the PDF package manual.

    * R CMD Rd2pdf now always runs LaTeX in batch mode, consistent with
      Texinfo >= 6.7. The --batch option is ignored.

    * R CMD build and R CMD check now include the Rd file name and line
      numbers in the error message of an \Sexpr evaluation failure.

    * For packages using the \doi Rd macro (now an install-time \Sexpr)
      but no other dynamic Rd content, R CMD build now produces a
      smaller tarball and is considerably faster - skipping temporary
      package installation.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The non-API header R_ext/R-ftp-http.h is no longer provided, as
      the entry points it covered are now all defunct.

    * A number of non-API declarations and macro definitions have been
      moved from the installed header Rinternals.h to the internal
      header Defn.h. Packages that only use entry points and
      definitions documented to be part of the API as specified in
      'Writing R Extensions' SS6 should not be affected.

    * The macro USE_RINTERNALS no longer has any effect when compiling
      package code.  Packages which also use R_NO_REMAP will need to
      ensure that the remapped names are used for calls to API
      functions that were formerly also made available as macros.

    * The deprecated legacy S-compatibility macros PROBLEM, MESSAGE,
      ERROR, WARN, WARNING, RECOVER, ... are no longer defined in
      R_exts/RS.h (included by R.h).  Replace these by calls to
      Rf_error and Rf_warning (defined in header R_ext/Error.h included
      by R.h).

      Header R_ext/RS.h no longer includes R_ext/Error.h.

    * Header R_ext/Constants.h (included by R.h) when included from C++
      now includes the C++ header cfloat rather than the C header
      float.h (now possible as C++11 is required).

    * The legacy S-compatibility macros DOUBLE_* in R_ext/Constants.h
      (included by R.h) are deprecated.

    * The deprecated S-compatibility macros SINGLE_* in
      R_ext/Constants.h (included by R.h) have been removed.

    * R_Calloc, R_Free and R_Realloc are preferred to their unprefixed
      forms and error messages now use the prefix. These forms were
      introduced in R 3.4.0 and are available even when
      STRICT_R_HEADERS is defined.

    * rmultinom has been documented in 'Writing R Extensions' SS6 so is
      now part of the R API.

    * Similarly, Rtanpi, called from R level tanpi() is now part of the
      R API.

    * The long-deprecated, undocumented and non-API entry point call_R
      is no longer declared in R_ext/RS.h (included by R.h).

    * The header S.h which has been unsupported since Jan 2016 has been
      removed.  Use R.h instead.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * The (non-default and deprecated) method = "internal" for
      download.file() and url() no longer supports http:// nor ftp://
      URIs.  (It is used only for file:// URIs.)

      On Windows, download.file(method = "wininet") no longer supports
      ftp:// URIs.  (It is no longer the default method, which is
      "libcurl" and does.)

      On Windows, the deprecated method = "wininet" now gives a warning
      for http:// and https:// URIs for both download.file() and url().
      (It is no longer the default method.)

    * On Windows, the command-line option --max-mem-size and
      environment variable R_MAX_MEM_SIZE are defunct.  The memory
      allocation limit was important for 32-bit builds, but these are
      no longer supported.

    * default.stringsAsFactors() is now formally deprecated, where that
      was only mentioned on its regular help page, previously.  So it
      now gives a warning if called.

    * unix.time() is defunct now; it had been deprecated since R 3.4.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Setting digits = 0 in format(), print.default() (and hence
      typically print()) or options() is again invalid.  Its behaviour
      was platform-dependent, and it is unclear what "zero significant
      digits" should mean (PR#18098).

    * Messages from C code in the cairo section of package grDevices
      are now also offered for translation, thanks to Michael Chirico's
      PR#18123.

    * mean(x) with finite x now is finite also without "long.double"
      capability.

    * R CMD Rd2pdf no longer leaves an empty build directory behind
      when it aborts due to an already existing output file.  (Thanks
      to Sebastian Meyer's PR#18141.)

    * density(x, weights = w, na.rm = TRUE) when anyNA(x) is true, now
      removes weights "in parallel" to x, fixing PR#18151, reported by
      Matthias Gondan.  Additionally, it gets a subdensity option.

    * Conversion of \Sexpr[]{<expR>} to LaTeX or HTML no longer
      produces long blocks of empty lines when <expR> itself contains
      several lines all producing empty output.  Thanks to a report and
      patch by Ivan Krylov posted to R-devel.

    * R CMD build no longer fails if a package vignette uses child
      documents and inst/doc exists.  (Thanks to Sebastian Meyer's
      PR#18156.)

    * When an R documentation ('help' source) file man/foo.Rd in a
      package has \donttest{..} examples with a syntax error, it is now
      signalled as ERROR and with correct line numbers relating to the
      *-Ex.R file, thanks to Duncan Murdoch and Sebastian Meyer's
      reports and patch proposals in PR#17501.

    * Improved determination of the correct translation domain in
      non-base packages, addressing the combination of PR#18092 and
      PR#17998 (#c6) with reports and _augmented_ patch #2904 by
      Suharto Anggono.

      Note that "R-base" is no longer the default domain e.g., for
      top-level calls to gettext(); rather translation needs explicit
      domain = * specification in such cases.

    * identical(attrib.as.set=FALSE) now works correctly with data
      frames with default row names (Thanks to Charlie Gao's PR#18179).

    * txtProgressBar() now enforces a non-zero width for argument char,
      without which no progress can be visible.

    * dimnames(table(d)) is more consistent in the case where d is a
      list with a single component, thanks to Thomas Soeiro's report to
      R-devel.

      Further, table(d1, d2) now gives an error when d1 and d2 are data
      frames as suggested by Thomas in PR#18224.

    * Fix for drawing semi-transparent lines and fills on the native
      Windows graphics device (PR#18219 and PR#16694).  Thanks to Nick
      Ray for helpful diagnosis on Bugzilla.

    * The deparser now wraps sub-expressions such as if(A) ..  with
      parentheses when needed; thanks to Duncan Murdoch's PR#18232 and
      Lionel Henry's patches there.

    * remove.packages() no longer tries to uninstall Priority: base
      packages, thanks to a report and suggestions by Colin Fay in
      PR#18227.

    * win.metafile() now has xpinch and ypinch arguments so that the
      user can override Windows' (potentially wrong) guess at device
      dimensions.

    * x[i] and x[[i]] for non-integer i should now behave in all cases
      as always documented: the index used is equivalent to
      as.integer(i) unless that would overflow where trunc(i) is used
      instead; thanks to Suharto Anggono's report and patch proposals
      in PR#17977.

    * asOneSidedFormula() now associates the resulting formula with the
      global environment rather than the evaluation environment created
      for the call.

    * <bibentry>$name now matches the field name case-insensitively,
      consistent with bibentry() creation and the replacement method.

    * cbind() failed to detect some length mismatches with a mixture of
      time-series and non-time-series inputs.

    * The default LaTeX style file Sweave.sty used by the RweaveLatex
      driver no longer loads the obsolete ae package; thanks to a
      report by Thomas Soeiro in PR#18271.  Furthermore, it now skips
      \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} for engines other than pdfTeX (if
      detected) or if the new [nofontenc] option is used.

    * smooth.spline() now stores its logical cv argument more safely,
      fixing a rare bug when printing, and also stores n.

    * smooth.spline(x,y,*) now computes the cv.crit statistic
      correctly, also when is.unsorted(x), fixing PR#18294.

    * The data.frame method of rbind() now warns when binding
      not-wholly-recycling vectors, by analogy to the default method
      (for matrices).

    * setAs() finds the correct class for name to when multiple
      packages define a class with that name. Thanks to Gabor Csardi
      for the report.

    * Fix for detaching a package when two classes of the same name are
      present in method signatures for the same generic. Thanks to
      Gabor Csardi for the report.

    * match.arg("", c("", "a", "B")) gives a better error message, in
      part from PR#17959, thanks to Elin Waring.

    * R CMD Sweave --clean no longer removes pre-existing files or
      subdirectories (PR#18242).

    * The quartz() device no longer splits polylines into subpaths.
      That has caused narrowly-spaced lines with many points to always
      look solid even when dashed line type was used due to dash phase
      restarts.

    * Deparsing constructs such as quote(1 + `!`(2) + 3) works again as
      before R 3.5.0, thanks to the report and patch in PR#18284 by
      Suharto Anggono.

    * as.list(f) for a factor f now keeps names(f), fixing PR#18309.

    * qbeta(.001, .9, .009) and analogous qf() calls now return a
      correct value instead of NaN or wrongly 1, all with a warning;
      thanks to the report by Ludger Goeminne in PR#18302.

    * plot.lm() failed to produce the plot of residuals vs.  factor
      levels (i.e., which=5 when leverages are constant) for models
      with character predictors (PR#17840).

    * interaction.plot(..., xtick = TRUE) misplaced the x-axis line
      (PR#18305).

    * Not strictly fixing a bug, format()ing and print()ing of
      non-finite Date and POSIXt values NaN and +/-Inf no longer show
      as NA but the respective string, e.g., Inf, for consistency with
      numeric vector's behaviour, fulfilling the wish of PR#18308.

    * R CMD check no longer runs test scripts generated from
      corresponding .Rin files twice and now signals an ERROR if
      processing an .Rin script fails.

    * tools::Rd2txt() used for plain-text help pages now renders \hrefs
      (if tools::Rd2txt_options(showURLs = TRUE)) and \urls with
      percent-encoding and standards-compliant delimiting style (angle
      brackets and no URL: prefix).  \email is now rendered with a
      mailto: prefix.

Subject: [Rd] R 4.2.1 is released
Message-ID: <8041EC09-6465-4939-896A-E85F838AADA3@cbs.dk>

The build system rolled up R-4.2.1.tar.gz (codename "One Push-Up") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release. 

You can get the source code from

https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.2.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

CHANGES IN R 4.2.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * New function utils::findCRANmirror() to find out if a CRAN mirror
      has been selected, otherwise fallback to the main site.  This
      behaves in the same way as tools::CRAN_package_db() and is
      intended for packages wishing to access CRAN for purposes other
      than installing packages.

      The need for this was shown by a day when the main CRAN website
      was offline and a dozen or so packages which had its URL
      hardcoded failed their checks.

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * The libraries searched for by --with-blas (without a value) now
      include BLIS (after OpenBLAS but before ATLAS).  And on macOS,
      the Accelerate framework (after ATLAS).  (This is patterned after
      the AX_BLAS macro from the Autoconf Archive.)

    * The included LAPACK sources have been updated to 3.10.1.

  UTILITIES:

    * The (full path to) the command tidy to be used for HTML
      validation can be set by environment variable R_TIDYCMD.

    * Setting environment variable _R_CHECK_RD_VALIDATE_RD2HTML_ to a
      false value will override R CMD check --as-cran and turn off HTML
      validation.  This provides a way to circumvent a problematic
      tidy.

      The 2006 version that ships with macOS is always skipped.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The undocumented legacy declarations of Sint, Sfloat, SINT_MAX
      and SINT_MIN in header R.h are deprecated.

  BUG FIXES:

    * fisher.test(d) no longer segfaults for "large" d; fixing PR#18336
      by preventing/detecting an integer overflow reliably.

    * tar(., files=*) now produces correctly the warning about invalid
      uid or gid of files, fixing PR#18344, reported by Martin Morgan.

    * tk_choose.files() with multi = FALSE misbehaved on paths
      containing spaces (PR#18334) (regression introduced in R 4.0.0).

    * sort(x, partial = ind, *) now works correctly notably for the
      non-default na.last = FALSE or TRUE, fixing PR#18335 reported by
      James Edwards.

    * Environment variable _R_CHECK_XREFS_REPOSITORIES_ is only used
      for checking .Rd cross-references in R CMD check (as documented)
      and not for other uses looking for a CRAN mirror.

    * The search for a CRAN mirror when checking packages now uses
      getOption("repos") if that specifies a CRAN mirror, even when it
      does not also specify all three Bioconductor repositories (as was
      previously required).

    * The HTML code generated by tools::Rd2HTML() has been improved to
      pass tidy 5.8.0.

  BUG FIXES on Windows:

    * Writing to a clipboard connection works again, fixing a
      regression in R 4.2.0 (PR#18332).  Re-using a closed clipboard
      connection longer issues a spurious warning about an ignored
      encoding argument.

    * C function getlocale no longer attempts to query an unsupported
      category from the OS, even when requested at R level, which may
      cause crashes when R 4.2.0 (which uses UCRT) is embedded
      (reported by Kevin Ushey).

    * Accent keys now work in GraphApp Unicode windows, which are used
      by Rgui whenever running in a multibyte locale (so also in UTF-8,
      hence fixing a regression in R 4.2.0 for users of systems where R
      4.1 used a single-byte locale).

    * Completion in Rgui now works also with non-ASCII characters.

    * Rgui no longer truncates usage information with --help.

    * Text injection from external applications via SendInput now works
      in GraphApp Unicode windows, fixing a regression in R 4.2.0 for
      Rgui users of systems where R 4.1 used a single-byte locale but R
      4.2.0 uses UTF-8.

    * Performance of txtProgressBar() in Rgui when running in a
      multi-byte locale has been improved (fixing a performance
      regression in R 4.2.0 for users of systems where R 4.1 used a
      single-byte locale).

    * The script editor in Rgui now works also on systems using UTF-8
      as the native encoding.  Users of the script editor have to
      convert their scripts with non-ASCII characters to UTF-8 before
      reading them in R 4.2.1 or newer (on recent Windows where UTF-8
      is used).  This fixes a regression in R 4.2.0, which prevented
      some operations with scripts when they contained non-ASCII
      characters.

CHANGES IN R 4.2.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * tools::Rdiff(useDiff = TRUE) checks for the presence of an
      external diff command and switches to useDiff = FALSE if none is
      found.  This allows R CMD Rdiff to always work.

    * On Windows, environment variable R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT
      can be used to switch to only 'best-effort' SSL certificate
      revocation checks with the default "libcurl" download method.
      This reduces security, but may be needed for downloads to work
      with MITM proxies (PR#18379).

    * (macOS) The run-time check for libraries from XQuartz for X11 and
      Tcl/Tk no longer uses otool from the Apple Developer Tools
      (PR#18400).

    * The LaTeX style for producing the PDF manuals, Rd.sty, now loads
      the standard amsmath, amsfonts and amssymb packages for greater
      coverage of math commands in the Rd \eqn and \deqn macros.  The
      \mathscr LaTeX command is also provided (via the mathrsfs
      package, if available, or the amsfonts bundle otherwise),
      fulfilling the wish of PR#18398.

    * (Windows) The default format of readClipboard() and
      writeClipboard() has been changed to 13 (CF_UNICODETEXT).

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * The PDF manuals (if built) can be compacted by the new target
      make compact-pdf (at the top level or in directory doc/manual).

    * There is now configure support for LLVM clang 15 on Linux, which
      defaults to position-independent (PIE) executables whereas
      gfortran does not.

    * Many small changes to ease compilation (and suppress warnings)
      with LLVM clang 15.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Rscript -e would fail if stdin were closed (Reported by Henrik
      Bengtsson.)

    * qt(*, log.p=TRUE) in outer tails no longer produces NaN in its
      final steps, thus fixing PR#18360.

    * tools::Rd2latex() now escapes hashes and ampersands when writing
      URLs, fixing LaTeX errors with such URLs in \tabular.

    * When isGeneric(f, fdef=*) is used with mismatching names, the
      warning is better understandable; reported (with fix) in PR#18370
      by Gabe Becker.

    * poly(x, n) now works again (and is now documented) when x is a
      "Date" or "POSIXct" object, or of another class while fulfilling
      mode(x) == "numeric".  This also enables poly(x, *, raw=TRUE) for
      such variables.  Reported by Michael Chirico to R-devel.

    * write.table(), write.csv() and write.csv2() restore their
      numerical precision (internal equivalent of digits = 15) after an
      interrupt (PR#18384).

    * One can now read also byte FF from a clipboard connection
      (PR#18385).

    * source("") and source(character()) now give more helpful error
      messages.

    * R CMD check --as-cran set _R_CHECK_TIMINGS_ too late to have the
      intended effect.

    * as.POSIXlt(x) now also works with very large dates x, fixing
      PR#18401 reported by Hannes M"uhleisen.

    * Files can now be extracted even from very large zip archives
      (PR#18390, thanks to Martin Jakt).

    * Non-finite objects of class "POSIXlt" are now correctly coerced
      to classes "Date" and "POSIXct"; following up on the extension to
      format() them correctly.

    * Added methods for is.finite(), is.infinite() and is.nan() for
      "POSIXlt" date-time objects.

  BUG FIXES on Windows:

    * Non-ASCII characters are now properly displayed on Windows in
      windows created using GraphApp via e.g. winDialogString thanks to
      a workaround for an at least surprising Windows behavior with
      UTF-8 as the system encoding (PR#18382).

    * Find and replace operations work again in the script editor in
      Rgui on Windows.

    * Computation of window size based on requested client size in
      GraphApp when running in a multi-byte locale on Windows has been
      fixed (regression in R 4.2.0 for users of systems where R 4.1
      used a single-byte locale).  Rgui again respects the number of
      console rows and columns given in Rconsole file.

    * Rterm support for Alt+xxx sequences has been fixed to produce the
      corresponding character (only) once. This fixes pasting text with
      tilde on Italian keyboard (PR#18391).

Subject: Call for proposals to organize a hybrid useR! in 2023 or 2024
Message-ID: <fd5b1015-6d40-41fa-be6f-cb23e6011f14@app.fastmail.com>

Dear All,

The R Foundation Conference Committee invites proposals to organize a hybrid useR! in 2023 or 2024:

https://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR_2023_call.html

The call is open to teams worldwide and the deadline for outline proposals is **Wednesday 30 November 2022**. 

Selected hosts will have support from the R Consortium to underwrite event management provided or managed by the Linux Foundation Events Team.

Any queries should be sent to R-conferences at r-project.org (after a careful read of the call!).

Best wishes,

Heather Turner
on behalf of the R Foundation Conference Committee
