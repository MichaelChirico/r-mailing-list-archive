# R Mailing Lists

The R ecosystem includes a few mailing lists for technical issues. The archives of these lists are freely available, and can be searched specifically (e.g. on Google for `r-devel`) with pattern `{search terms} site:/stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/` (h/t @gmbecker).

This repository exists so you can clone it & then use command-line facilities like `grep`/`awk` to search more flexibly, or if you wanted to turn these archives into a data set (e.g. for NLP).

Infinite gratitude to the maintainers of R, CRAN, and these mailing lists.

We track the following archives (file an issue to get a new list added):

## `r-announce`: announcements, e.g. releases

> This list is for _major_ (aka "important") announcements about the development of R and the availability of new code

## `r-devel`: technical questions about R itself

> This list is intended for questions and discussion about code development in R. Questions likely to prompt discussion unintelligible to non-programmers or topics that are too technical for R-help's audience should go to R-devel

## `r-help`: general-purpose list for help using R

> The main R mailing list, for announcements about the development of R and the availability of new code, questions and answers about problems and solutions using R, enhancements and patches to the source code and documentation of R, comparison and compatibility with S and S-plus, and for the posting of nice examples and benchmarks.

## `r-package-devel`: technical questions about R package development

> This list is to get help about package development in R. The goal of the list is to provide a forum for learning about the package development process. We hope to build a community of R package developers who can help each other solve problems, and reduce some of the burden on the CRAN maintainers. If you are having problems developing a package or passing R CMD check, this is the place to ask!

## `r-sig-mac`: Special interest group (SIC) on Mac + R

> This list might be used also for bug reports or feature requests on the R application for OS X.

## `r-sig-geo`: Special interest group (SIC) on using geographical data and mapping

> A mailing list for discussing the development and use of R functions and packages for handling and analysis of spatial, and particularly geographical, data. The list also covers mapping and cartographic issues, and interfaces between R and geographical information systems.

## `r-sig-finance`: Special interest group (SIC) on R in finance

> A mailing list for discussing the use of R in finance.
