Hello,

Sorry for my late reply.

I do not the total number of cells, and yes it is pretty large.

I tried family = "ordbeta" :

M1b <- glmmTMB(propCFU~ parent_state * TIME + (1|SAMPLE), 
data=prop_daughters, family=ordbeta)

Anova(M1b,type="III")
Analysis of Deviance Table (Type III Wald chisquare tests)

Response: propCFUdaught
 ??????????????????? Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq)
(Intercept)?????? 184.388? 1? < 2.2e-16 ***
parent_treat?????? 23.174? 1? 1.480e-06 ***
TIME?????????????? 24.162? 4? 7.411e-05 ***
parent_treat:TIME? 20.683? 4? 0.0003659 ***

when I use plot(simulateResiduals(M1b)) from the DHARMa package, the 
plots do not show significant deivations which is a clear improvement 
compared to my previous model. However, I am worried that the p-values I 
obtain are pretty low considering I have between 11 and 14 data points 
per treatment combination and a random factor.

How would I run a zero-inflated beta-binomial model ? I have found the 
ZIBR package which seems to have been developed for analysing microbiome 
data. I am not sure this is adapted to what I am trying to test ?

Best, and happy new year !!

Caroline

Subject: [R-sig-ME] Introduction to Generalised Linear Mixed Models for
 Ecologists
Message-ID: <CAEsSYzz11EUojrNDOMjvH15XkfD7tbYho6BHAc59HevBM-JU1g@mail.gmail.com>

Introduction to Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Ecologists
<https://prstats.org/course/introduction-to-generalised-linear-mixed-models-for-ecologists-mmie01/>Learn
to build and interpret linear, generalised linear, and multilevel models
for ecological data using R, lme4, and rstanarm in this five day applied
training course.

https://prstats.org/course/bayesian-multilevel-modelling-using-brms-for-ecologists-mmie02/

Join our intensive live-online workshop: *Bayesian Multilevel Modelling
using brms for Ecologists*. If you work with ecological data and want to
advance beyond standard regression into hierarchical modelling,
spatial/temporal structure and full Bayesian workflows, this course is for
you.

*What you will learn*

   -

   A full foundation in Bayesian inference: priors, posteriors, credible
   intervals and uncertainty quantification.
   -

   How to fit and interpret generalised linear models (GLMs) and
   multilevel/hierarchical models using the brms package in R.
   -

   How to specify meaningful priors for ecological parameters and perform
   model criticism via posterior predictive checks, WAIC, LOO-CV and other
   diagnostics.
   -

   How to model non-Gaussian ecological responses (counts, proportions,
   zero-inflation), and account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in
   your hierarchical models.
   -

   How to build multivariate or joint species-distribution models,
   interpret group-level effects, visualise hierarchical structures and
   communicate results effectively.

*Who should attend*
This course is designed for ecologists, data analysts, postgraduate
researchers and early-career scientists who already have some experience
with R and basic statistical concepts (e.g., mean, variance, correlation,
linear regression). While prior exposure to GLMs is helpful, the essentials
will be reviewed and built upon.

*Format & logistics*

   -

   Live online sessions (5 days, approx. 6 hours per day) covering 30 hours
   of instruction, practical exercises and guided coding.
   -

   Sessions are recorded and made available so you can revisit content if
   you miss a live slot.
   -

   Participants are encouraged to bring their own ecological datasets where
   possible, for practical application.

*Why this course stands out*

   -

   It bridges the gap between theoretical Bayesian modelling and applied
   ecological data analysis, focusing on workflows that ecologists can use in
   real research settings.
   -

   Emphasis on interpretation, visualisation and clear communication of
   uncertainty ? not just model fitting.
   -

   Uses the brms package which allows flexible specification of
   hierarchical models while leveraging powerful backend tools (Stan) for
   Bayesian computation.

*How to register / next steps*
Visit the PR Stats website for full course details, upcoming dates and
registration information. Early registration is recommended as places may
be limited. If you have questions about suitability, software requirements
(R, RStudio, brms package) or data prerequisites, contact the course
organisers for guidance.

Message-ID: <e7ae7a14-176c-4589-b87f-2bdef5070908@highstat.com>

Dear colleagues,

We?re happy to announce an upcoming hybrid course:

Introduction to GLMMs and GAMMs with R. - With applications to spatial, 
temporal, and spatial-temporal data-
2?6 March 2026, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia (or join 
online via Zoom)

This is a hands-on, applied course designed for people who want to use 
GLMMs and GAMMs in practice, rather than get lost in theory or heavy 
maths. The aim is to help you understand what these models are doing, 
how to fit them in R, and how to interpret and visualise the results.

We start with a short refresher on multiple linear regression and 
generalised linear models, then move on to generalised additive models 
(GAMs) ? a flexible and intuitive way to deal with non-linear 
relationships. From there, we introduce mixed-effects models for grouped 
or repeated-measures data, and finally bring everything together in 
generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs).

In the final part of the course, we apply these models to spatial, 
temporal, and spatial-temporal data, using realistic examples with 
different types of response variables, including continuous and count data.

Across five modules, we cover:

* How GAMs work, including model selection and smoother interactions
* Linear mixed-effects models and Gaussian additive mixed models
* Hierarchical GAMs (the GAM equivalent of random-slope models)
* Poisson and negative binomial GLMMs and GAMMs
* Applications to spatial and spatial-temporal data
* Guidance on analysing binary, proportional, and continuous data (time 
allowing)

All analyses are done in R, mainly using the mgcv and glmmTMB packages.

Each module includes practical exercises with real data and fully 
annotated R scripts. Before the course starts, you?ll also get access to 
preparatory materials (short videos and exercises) covering linear 
regression, Poisson GLMs, DHARMa model validation, and variograms. PDF 
copies of all theory slides are provided as well.

As part of the course, we also include a free 1-hour one-to-one video 
meeting, where you can discuss your own data or analysis questions with 
one or both instructors.

Venue: James Cook University, Townsville Campus, Australia (hybrid format)
Dates & times: 2?6 March 2026, 09.00?16.00 (local time)
Price: ?500
Instructors: Dr. Alain Zuur and Dr. Elena Ieno

Dear all,
 
We are excited to announce the 4th edition of our Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) in R online course, taking place September 21?24..
 
For more information and to register, please visit:
[ https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-work/glmms-in-r ]( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-work/glmms-in-r )
 
 
This course is designed for graduate students and researchers with experience in generalized linear models who want to deepen their skills to analyze complex grouped and correlated data. You will learn to specify, interpret, and validate GLMMs using the R packages lme4 and glmmTMB, along with hands-on training on model diagnostics and assumption checking using DHARMa.
 
The basics of linear models (LM), generalized linear models (GLM), and ANOVA are reviewed at the start of the course. However, if you do not have a solid understanding of these topics, you may benefit more from our course ?Generalized Linear Models as a Unified Framework for Data Analysis in R,? also offered by Physalia: [ https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/glm-in-r-1/ ]( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/glm-in-r-1/ )
