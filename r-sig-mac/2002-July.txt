Message-ID: <60BC3646-8D33-11D6-895D-003065A21C86@stat.ucla.edu>

Is available from ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub. It has

--- a new package fink.pkg (replacing the older package sw.pkg), which 
has dylibs
      for support of tcltk, netcdf, gnome, XML, readline, jpeg, tiff, 
png, zlib, bz2. It
      installs in /sw, and if I have included what I intended to include, 
you do not
      need fink anymore. It also has /sw/bin/less.

--- updates for many contributed packages.

Unpack with Expander to get the diskimage R-1.5.1.dmg. Then just click
and click and click and click and everything will be installed in 
/usr/local.
After installing, just say "R" in a terminal window.

In the same directory you also find XInstall.app, which installs a 
complete
Xfree86 plus XDarwin on your system, filling /usr/X11R6 and /usr/etc/X11
with bins and dylibs.

And it has OroborusOSX, the incredible Aqua-like rootless window manager.

Jan,

I have some questions from the perspective of someone who would like 
to use the new R dmg, but also uses fink for other things (for 
example, an X11-enabled emacs).

Basically, does fink.pkg overwrite dylibs already installed by 
fink--and if so, what you have in mind for version control?

That is, I currently have a bunch of fink-installed dylibs in 
/sw/lib, used by who-knows-what other packages I installed with fink.

If I install fink.pkg, and it replaces some fink dylibs, and then 
later I run fink update on some package, and it replaces those dylibs 
with newer ones, is that likely to break R? Will you have to keep 
playing "catch-up" with fink, watching for new dylibs, and releasing 
a new R installer when necessary? What if fink gets ahead, and the R 
installer overwrites fink-installed dylib with an older one?

Or, suppose I have an older version of some dylib installed by fink, 
and I overwrite it with a newer one from R's fink.pkg. Then, later 
on, when I run fink update on some fink package, will fink get 
confused because version of the dylib actually there doesn't match 
fink's record of what version is there? Or the version order could be 
reversed.  If that's the case, then it would make sense to update all 
with fink before installing R. Or


Thanks
-Don

Overwriting by fink with newer versions is no problem. Overwriting
by R of newer fink versions by older versions is not a problem now,
but may become one. So, to be on the save side, if you also use fink
for other purposes you install the other packages and not the fink
package (it's optional anyway). Also, fink will not get confused
because it does not check for dylibs but for debs.

My reasoning is that if people actually use fink, they have the
developer package installed, and they can compile their own R
(either from fink or from source).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]R-devel (new version with native tcltk)
Message-ID: <247005C4-A11E-11D6-A4F5-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

See

ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

There you will find R-devel.tar.gz and MacOSXTk8.4a4-2.tar.gz.
The tcl/tk in the last file is native and the tcltk package in R has
been compiled using this native AquaTk. Thus you do not need
an X server to run the tcltk demos. Since R-devel comes with the
quartz() device, you have a version of R here that runs from the
terminal and does all its graphics (including tk) without X11. In fact
this R has been compiled with the --without-x flag.

Install the Tcl and Tk frameworks in /Library/Frameworks, and
do not forget to edit bin/R to reflect where you install this R.

There is one major problem with this R that prevents it from being
anything more than just interesting. It does not have an event handler, 
and
thus the window of the quartz device and the windows made by
tcltk do not react to mouse or keybord. You cannot click them
to bring them to the front, you have to move other windows out of
the way. You cannot fill in the tk dialogs or click the tk buttons.

To make this a practical R, someone has to add some sort of event
handler, and maybe add the Carbon or Cocoa GUI as well.

For the emacs fans:

ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub/emacs

now has three versions of emacs. All three are
self-contained, in the sense that you do not need any
emacs lisp files and tools elsewhere on your system.
Everything is in the application bundle.

carbonemacs.tar.gz is emacs 21.1 with a Carbon GUI, using
emacs 21.1 from ftp.gnu.org, with patches by Andrew Choi
(akochoi@mac.com) and with various contributions
by David Caldwell (david@porkrind.org). Recompiled for Jaguar. See
http://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/ and http://www.porkrind.org/emacs/

cocoaemacs.tar.gz is emacs 20.7 with a Cocoa GUI by
Christophe de Dinechin (descubes@earthlink.net).
Recompiled for Jaguar. See http://emacs-on-aqua.sourceforge.net/
This one has hard-coded paths, and it must be installed in
/Applications/Text/Editors/CocoaEmacs. You have to create this
directory.

xemacs.tar.gz is xemacs 19.14 with a Carbon GUI, done by Pitts
Jarvis (pjarvis@mac.com). It did not require recompilation for Jaguar.
See http://homepage.mac.com/pjarvis/xemacs.html

If you want to install emacs packages such as ESS, you can do this
in the bundle itself. Let me know if you come across any problems.

Message-ID: <p05111b06b96c703a4d64@[193.49.112.222]>

Hi:

I am using R for MacOS X .5.1 and found a strange behavior. Nothing 
happens when I run the following script using "source file":

	dat = read.table(header=T,sep="\t",file="stylprg.dat")
	attach(dat)
	xyplot(g ~ day | nubbin)
	detach(dat)


The prompt is back but no graphics is displayed. However, the xyplot 
command work fine when I type it in the command line and a graphic is 
displayed when the xyplot command is replaced by "plot(day,g)" in the 
script.

Help would be appreciated!

Cheesr,
jp
