Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] weird race condition bug.
Message-ID: <06D8D7D1-2C3A-11D9-9AC4-000D93C24D64@hsph.harvard.edu>

There appears to be a race condition in console output event. For 
instance, typing 'help' to show the function as the first command after 
loading on my Powerbook results in double output (half black, half 
blue) that kills the console for further input and the following error 
in the console:

2004-11-01 11:06:56.372 R[681] *** NSTimer discarding exception 
'NSRangeException' (reason '*** NSRunStorage, _NSBlockNumberForIndex(): 
index (2919) beyond array bounds (2000)') that raised during firing of 
timer with target 3ace80 and selector 'runRELP:'


However, doing some stuff and then trying the same command doesn't 
result in the same problem. Either its just the particular timing of 
the event or something about the startup process that causes the 
problem. In any case, I expect it will be hard to replicate, but a 
showstopper when it happens to people. Just a heads up.

It's not quite clear what happens there - I can reproduce this on my 
PowerBook, too. However, it's not really a show-stopper, because 
hitting <Esc> will give you console back and everything is OK again.

It's hard to tell if this is related to the timer (we're using a 
one-shot timer to start the REPL), or something else ... I'll keep on 
digging ...

	Notes (Not a Bug Report!)
Message-ID: <6F045B40-2C5C-11D9-9AC4-000D93C24D64@stat.harvard.edu>

Disclaimer: To Simon and Stefano, this does not constitute a bug 
report---I know you guys are busy and have enough on your plate w.r.t. 
R (and doing a great job), let alone your Real Jobs. Its more thinking 
out loud in the (apparently) rapidly growing community of OS X R 
users---it seems like there have been more messages on this list in the 
last two weeks than the last six months, which is great.

Ok, so after a very quick hack to add back and forward buttons and make 
the current toolbar a real toolbar, it appears that the Help system is 
generally broken.

The hack that grabs '?' and 'help' is seems to be the culprit (but I 
see why its there, discussed below)---? is actually both a binary and a 
unary operator so calls of x?y don't get snagged and valid calls to 
help() erroneously bring up the HTML help (help("foo",offline=TRUE), 
for example, does not work anymore). Its fine for casual use, but it 
breaks for heavy users of S4 classes (e.g., Bioconductor users).

Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems that account for the 
hack's existence:
1) R internal help goes through the general pager so, under normal 
circumstances, we end up with non-linkable HTML files. Its possible to 
improve the current pager to support underlines and such, but it seems 
a waste.

2) We can force HTML help (essentially set htmlhelp=TRUE under the Aqua 
platform) and add .show_help_on_topic_as_HTML to the aqua-specific 
subdirectory of package:utils to route to an internal call (say, 
Re_show_help) that brings it up using WebKit (or, if web kit isn't 
available routes to the user's local web browser).

Sadly, this modifies the semantics of help(htmlhelp=TRUE) under OS X, 
which is sort of lame. We could have an option in a preferences panel 
to allow users to route to the default (or an arbitrary) HTML viewer. 
However, its my best proposal at this point (and I've already 
implemented a chunk of it so I can keep going if y'all would like).

Turns out Duncan is right. We really do want ?foo to be an alias for 
show(help("foo")). Especially since it would be much easier to track 
the path through the help system if URLs were of the form 
"help://utils/foo" or something and not "http://...."

More Things Noted:

Only two-level nesting in the Workspace Browser doesn't work:

data(iris)
nested = c()
nested$someting = iris

doesn't let you drill down into "something". I'm guessing that this 
wasn't intentional as editing from the browser != nested$something = 
edit(nested$something)  (presumably the observation below would go 
towards remedying this problem)


Things that would be Fun:

dragging an element from the workspace browser to the console would 
paste it. I.e. dragging "Sepal.Length" from iris would paste 
iris[["Sepal.Length"]]. Even cooler would be cross-app drag-n-drop that 
pastes print(iris) when you drag iris, but thats more time consuming. 
;-) I may take a shot at the former since I think it would be fairly 
easy (though from a quick glance at the code, it probably requires a 
weak reference back link to the parent item in the former case). (My 
thought is not that it would actually be in the console work 
flow---more allowing drop targets in user-supplied things. Like a 
simple regression who's interface was just a plot and dragging 
"Sepal.Width" to the y-axis reruns the regression with "Sepal.Width" as 
the response. You get the idea.)

Byron,

if you read the docs and our comments, you would know that we 
emphasized that the "?" hack is very temporary and the only reason it 
was kept in the release was that a modification of R is necessary for 
the clean solution and it was too late to do that for the 2.0.0 
release.

IMHO the way to go (and I successfully tested) is to re-define the 
print methods for the help objects. As of htmlhelp - htmlhelp=FALSE 
basically doesn't make much sense in OS X. It's ok for the console 
version when the existence of a html browser is not guaranteed, but it 
make no sense in the Cocoa GUI.

With respect to this and the WB, you may have a look at JGR - it's got 
both issues solved pretty well I guess. The only reason it's not 
implemented in R.app is the lack of programming power :P So send us the 
diffs and we'll be happy to include it ;)

Sure, I arrived at roughly the same conclusion (and suspected that the 
hack was there for a good reason---though I apparently missed it in the 
documentation). I'd take it one step further and suggest that the help 
system in general Made Sense At The Time(tm) but that we have display 
environments rich enough that we really want to do on-the-fly 
calculations for a lot of these things (e.g., to eliminate the simlinks 
for HTML). A lot of Rd parsing stuff has been showing up in R for the 
quality control stuff, there's no reason it couldn't be harnessed to 
parse Rd files on the fly (I know the Gnome interface could to the same 
thing with Gtkhtml, as could Win32, though it already has the CHM 
system that works pretty well)---but doing that would mean a pretty 
major overhaul of the help system and I'm guessing there are higher 
priorities. (Dear Easter Bunny, Multiple evaluators/greenthreads would 
be "Da Bomb" ) :-)

I admire the look of JGR, but haven't had much time to play with 
it---but I see what you mean about the browser.

BTW, on a positive note, I think we just set some sort of record for 
"shortest time to prepare a grant" and the new Cocoa GUI had a lot to 
do with that---begin able to get the plot "just so" and hit Save As... 
was a real time saver.

FWIW, I have put the original package I developed
to access ObjectiveC code from R on the Omegahat Web site

 http://www.omegahat.org/RObjectiveC

I put there in case people can make use of the code in
there to assist in filling in Simon's package (or vice versa)
e.g. for the conversion of different data types,  some
reflectance material, etc.
I imagine Simon's package is a very good start, and I am
not offering this one as a competitor but hopefully
to encourage others to help merge the facilities.
I am happy to help make it do more things,
so if there are any issues, please mail me.

If I recall correctly,  there was an issue
with ObjectiveC on Linux and OSX handling references to structs
(or something "primitive") slightly different.
But I may just be forgetting.

thanks for sharing this with us!
Since the death of franz I could not find any Omegahat CVS repository 
with RObjectiveC in it (Jan and I were looking for it a while ago), 
that's why I put up the Cocoa draft here.

 From the quick look I could take at RObjectiveC it seems that your 
package is much more complete, provides good type conversion and is 
using S4 objects which has some benefits concerning reflection. At any 
rate I'm sure this surely helps to build the Cocoa widget package.

As of Obj-C and Linux: I guess our primary target is Darwin - once we 
have that well covered, we can tinkle with the GNU step support.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <418805F8.3080505@stat.wisc.edu>

I have a working version of R 2.0 with option packages installed on an 
OS X 10.3.5 system. Option packages were installed with install.binaries 
option and that seemed to work. Install using sources failed.

I tried installing bioconductor from sources and got mixed results (at 
best). Some packages failed to install (annotate, graph, Rgraphviz and 
maybe XML and possibly others). I also need to install arrayCGH to get 
DNAcopy. That uses the g77 compiler and failes with a mismatch of gcc 
library versions. I have g77 from fink.

Is there a install.binary option for bioconductor and some of the 
bioconductor contributed packages (specifically  arrayCGH)? If not now, 
when (if ever). If never, I may need some help to fix compile errors 
trying from source.

I am working on this for an Apple 4 node XServe to see if it can be used 
  under the iNquiry portal for R/Bioconductor applications.

hi Michael,

what exactly fails? You should set up the system as it is explained in 
the FAQ and g77 is one issue.
Are you using the getbioC script ? BioC 1.4 needs R 1.9.1 and 1.5 (to 
be released) needs R 2.0.0. You cannot use bioc 1.5 with 1.9.x

I strongly suggest you one of the two options
1. build R from scratch eventually using fink stuff
2. remove any fink stuff, and use the cran binary of R 2.0.0.

you should report the error logs to let us to help with these. I'm 
currently testing the build of BioC 1.5 using getBioC.
I'll put results here and on the bioc-related lists.

You want the g77 from http://hpc.sourceforge.net---the fink g77 has 
never worked properly for me (actually, thats a general statement about 
fink for me :-) )

Jan De Leeuw usually wraps up the latest Bioconductor release into his 
"Batteries Included" version of R. I don't think there's a dedicated OS 
X machine doing binary builds anymore (IIRC, there used to be one doing 
the nightly smoke test). Unfortunately, OS X is probably the most 
finicky platform at the moment as well for that reason.

Ooh! Could you ping me off list about how thats working out for you? 
Our group has been considering one to serve some of internal 
computational needs---we're mostly curious about how much 
administration and configuration it requires. (i.e., do you just turn 
it on and go?)

I have R 2.0.0 and am working with BioC 1.5, so far from source. I 
really don't want to compile from source if I can help it, but I can try 
setting up per the FAQ. It sounds like I should not use fink binaries 
for g77, and that I can fairly easily change.

I attached a text file of the status/error messages I have gotten so far 
in the BioC/DNAcopy installs.

Thanks for the quick response...
Mike

Byron,
I will try the sourceforge g77 in place of the fink version. I am still 
hoping I can find someone that has prebuilt the BioC binaries I need.

It may be possible to run the XServe as a turnkey system, but for now it 
is going to be a fair amount of work to get R and Bioconductor into the 
portal interface. Once there, access is easy to manage. It is still 
likely that, even with the portal, some number of the research community 
here will want to run the XServe as a full Unix system, so then 
administation will be more typical of other systems.

Thanks
Mike

well, for 1.4 there are binary builds. For 1.5 I'm late, but it should 
be me again.
I'll setup everything back soon.

i have an extra (unused) OSX machine under my desk at school, if its not 
too hard to rig up automated binary builds....

are these getting done on other platforms, such that i could just gank the 
scripts and do the builds?

Hi all  - in regards to the recent posts on both the r-mac and the  
bioconductor mail lists, I'll share a successful effort at getting the  
graph set of packages (graph, Rgraphviz, RBGL) in Bioconductor running  
on OS X.  I'd been trying for weeks with the source of graphviz, R 1.9  
and BioC 1.4, but all seems well now with R2.0, graphviz >=1.12 and  
Bioconductor 1.5.

I am running R2.0 with OSX 10.3.5 with dev tools installed and the  
latest g77 from HPC http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ (very important, i  
think)

My process was as follows

1) download graphviz 1.16 from ATT  
http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-1.16.tar.gz
2) move it to your home if necessary, and gunzip it, then tar -xvf it,  
both from a terminal/shell window
3) cd to that folder: graphviz-1.16
4) proceed with the "standard" 3 step build process in this terminal  
session, ignoring errors
./configure
make
sudo make install
5) quit this terminal and open X11
6) now, type export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/graphviz
(this makes a temporary "link" in this shell to the location of the  
graphviz libraries, so that Rgraphviz building knows what to look for,  
i think)
7) now, start R (in X11)
8) type source("http://www.bioconductor.org/getBioC.R")
9) type getBioC("graph")
10) wait for everthing to build.... it builds biocondctor basics and  
the three graphing packages; this puts the bioconductor libraries in  
the globally accessible library set, rather than in your home library
11) voila. 8-10 are as the bioconductor website suggests.  This worked  
for me, for the subset of bioconductor for graphing.  Quitting X11 and  
restarting the aqua interface or X11now both run graph and Rgraphviz

Hope this helps.... my guess is that installing the biconductor  
packages through X11, using getBioC() will make the effort smoother,  
but still allow their use in the aqua interface.

Hi Andrew,
thanks for your report.
I guess that steps from 5 to 11 will work under the aqua gui as well  
(using Sys.putenv for example and running the x11 server)

Yes, that's basically why there are print methods.

Anybody compiled R with the Autovectorizing gcc from

and noticed any speed up?

Hi, attached to this mail you'll find the crash report of the new (very 
nice) R GUI for Mac OS X. To make it crash I just double clicked on an 
R source file to open R and edit the source file; just when I try to 
write the first letter, the GUI crashes. The usual way to avoid this 
bug is to launch the R.app, type something in the console window and 
then open the source file; then I can edit the file without any problem 
  (well, more or less).

Best regards,

Now where would the speedup be coming from ? vecLib
has already been optimized, and vectorizing does not
handle double precision floating point. I am sure it is
possible to write C code (to be loaded into R) that can
be optimized by vectorization, but I am not sure there
is much in the standard R that will benefit a great deal.

[Sorry if this is a repost, but I got an odd error message previously trying
to reply to 'r-sig-mac-request@stat.math.ethz.ch']

Hi. I (the author) got a similar problem report two weeks ago and it was
also from a person running R v2.0.0 on Mac OS X. I do not have access to
this system so unfortunately I cannot troubleshoot it myself. 

The solution that worked for this person was to download the bundle manually

http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/R.classes_0.55.tar.gz

and run

R CMD INSTALL R.classes_0.55.tar.gz

from the system's command prompt.

Does this work? 

If it does, it is a good starting point for troubleshooting. The problem
seems to be that R.oo is not available (==installed) when it tries to
install R.audio, which depends on R.oo. I'm not 100% sure from your log
(below), if R tried (failed, succeeded?) to install the R.oo package first,
and then tried to install R.audio (your error message), or if it starts with
R.audio first. 

Have someone else on the R-SIG-Mac list experienced this? Try

install.packages("R.classes", contriburl="http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R")

Currently, it seems to me that this is a OSX problem only (based on sample
size n=2). If not, I will check with the r-devel list.

Best wishes

Henrik Bengtsson

Dear Henrik,
dear all,
same problem for me on Mac OSX R v 2.0.0.
However it works with Jan de Leeuw version.
Stefano Iacus is aware of the problem.

Thank you. I understand from your reply that there are a few MacOSX versions
maintained (or similar) and that the one maintained by Stefano Iacus is the
one giving the problem. 

To Stefano Iacus, if you not already know, I suspect that it has to do with
the order the packages are installed. Under "Packages bundles"
(http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Package%20bundles) it
says

"The Contains field [in DESCRIPTION] lists the packages, which should be
contained in separate subdirectories with the names given. During building
and installation, packages will be installed in the order specified. Be sure
to order this list so that dependencies are appropriately met."

With the introduction of lazy loading this is important. Before, it did not
seem to be a requirement in practice. Is this order strictly followed by the
MacOSX installation scripts?

Just a though.

It seems like the problem is in the fact that if R_LIBS is not defined  
the aqua GUI does not define it.
By default, the aqua GUI uses ~user_home/R/library and R.oo is in fact  
installed there (temporarily, then removed on failing).
One temporary solution is the following:
1. authenticate as root from within the Aqua GUI (i.e. click on the  
"lock")
2.  
install.packages("R.classes",contriburl="http://www.maths.lth.se/help/ 
R",lib=.libPaths[2])
this will install the bundle inside the framework.

and I have to figure out how to pass the lib argument to the script.

For some reason, you don't see the output of the package installation  
due to lack of synchronization when you run a script as a root.

FYI: the aqua GUI uses the same install.packages as the console  
version. The problem is that R CMD INSTALL (which is called by that  
function) is not aware of R_LIBS env var which is to the contrary  
needed in this bundle case.

Thanks for the report. My first guess is that the defaults for colors 
etc. are not set yet, because R initialization was not finished. Many 
strange things will happen if R.app is used before R is actually 
initialized - that's why we disable the console until R is ready. 
Obviously editor is one of those things that can be used independently. 
I'll fix this for the next build.

Cheers,
Simon

I am wondering if this is just my setup, or if it is true for others as  
well.


(a) rgenoud compiles fine, but does not load

 > library(rgenoud)
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :

Undefined symbols:
___gxx_personality_v0
Error: .onLoad failed in loadNamespace for 'rgenoud'
Error in library(rgenoud) : package/namespace load failed for 'rgenoud'


(b) some packages use the g++ script for linking (such as kernlab and  
knncat). This
fails, but manually replacing g++ by gcc in the link command works.

Thanks for the report, again. This bug is now fixed (SVN revision 704). 
Should be reflected in tonight's build.

The only things I could imagine are some loops on R objects (such as 
integer vectors), but you're right, it's very unlikely that this would 
affect R code. I could only think of C code in packages under some 
circumstances ... but admittedly rare. According to my tests you can 
get ca. 30% speed gain alone by using gcc optimization flags, but R 
won't make several basic the checks then ;). If you know what you're 
doing, it may be ok (but don't rely on NAs then - they may turn into 
zeroes).

Simon

Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.0.20041105113637.03c80420@magellan.umontreal.ca>

Hello all,
I have develop a small package with C code. The package works well with 
R-1.9.1 on windows and mac os x. One colleague has install R 2.0.0 on its 
mac and the cocoa interface. The library works well in terminal or aqua-gui 
version, but not with the cocoa version. I have to test what is exactly the 
problem, but I am quite sure that the problem is with the C code. The 
functions works well but the C code does not transform any of the 
arguments. The call is something like:
.C("myfunc", res=as.double(rep(0,n)), x=...). The vector res must be 
transformed by the C function but nothing happens.
What is very strange is that it happens only for the cocoa version.
I would like to know if others have encounter this kind of problems. I 
will  test different things to be more informative and produce a better 
description of the problem

Thanks,

PS: please reply to my personal address as I am not a member of this list 
... I am a poor windoze user but I think I will soon migrate to your 
community ;-)

Message-ID: <B54E196C-2F4B-11D9-B12F-0003931A8C1A@woodgasllc.com>

Hi,

When attempting to connect to a user level data source using  RODBC 
1.1-2,  I get a segmentation fault or illegal instruction and crash R.  
As in:

When I run "sudo R" this is the result:
 >library(RODBC)
 > cha<-odbcConnect("jeff")
Illegal instruction


When I try to connect to a system level data source with the same setup 
as the user level data source (with and without "sudo R"), I get some 
errors.  As in:


 > library(RODBC)
 > cha<-odbcConnect("pgjeffect")
Warning messages:

Manager]Data source name not found and no default driver specified. 
Driver could not be loaded
2: ODBC connection failed in: odbcDriverConnect(st, case = case,

Both data sources work great when accessed through Microsoft Query.  
iODBC Test.command hook up to the databases, and IODBC Adminsitrator 
"Test" reports "The connection DSN was tested successfully, and can be 
used at this time."  I have stored the username and password in the 
odbc.ini file.

I would believe it is a user error, as I only have a vague idea of how 
what I'm trying should work, but I'm stumped and don't know what else 
to try next to remedy the situation.

Has anyone seen this before and fixed it?  Is this expected behavior? 
What additional information would help determine an appropriate 
solution?

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Byron,
I have been having some success with R installation by replacing the 
fink version of g77 with the sourceforge version. So thanks very much 
for that info.

Now that I have a good R base system compiled on OS X (I am trying  both 
on a Powerbook for testing and on the XServe), I have been trying to 
load bioconductor to test compile with the sourceforge g77, but with no 
success over the last week. Something seems to have changed, since I was 
able to get further along before then.

On the Powebook, I do the standard connect to 
http://www.bioconductor.org/getBioC.R and the do the getBioC(). It spins 
for a few seconds, then gives an error message "Error in getBioC()" but 
with no additional diagnostic information. This is the same if I ask for 
default or specific packages. I also tried "verbose = TRUE" and got no 
additional info. When I try on the XServe, I get an error message "Error 
in file(file, "wb") : unable to open connection".

I am sure that I wasn't getting these messages when I first tried 
loading bioconductor to the XServe.

Any idea of what is up?
Thanks

Well,  I am at a loss...
Just after I sent this message to you, I tried one more time on the 
Powerbook, and now it appears to be successfully executing getBioC. I 
wish I new what I did differently. So far, it appears to be compiling 
successfully. I won't know until a lot later. I don't think the 
bioconductor default installations use g77. I need to install DNAcopy 
which is where I had problems in the past.

I will have to wait to try this again on the XServe. It is down at the 
moment for some hardware work.
Thanks

Message-ID: <f8e6ff05041109115370d6af8f@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone had any luck installing the hexbin package from bioconductor?

Using gui and installing from binaries: library(hexbin) gives "Error
in library(hexbin) : 'hexbin' is not a valid package -- installed <
2.0.0?"

Using gui and installing from source: gives "make: g77: Command not
found" (and I do have g77)

Using command line and R CMD install: "

Any suggestions?

Hadley,
Are you using the sourceforge version of g77 (rather than the fink 
version) as recommended in previous messages? I was getting errors 
similar to your:

ld: warning -L: directory name
(/usr/local/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin6.8/3.4.2) does not exist

when I used fink and they went away with sourceforge.
Thanks
Mike

Yup. I've built 1.1-4 (2004-10-27) from source without difficulty, 
though it doesn't pass CHECK apparently due to a (non-hexbin) related 
bug in the examples. However, the Release version seems to be 1.0 (and 
the download link broken at the moment). I'd recommend getting the 
Developer version of that package as the older hexbin packages were 
seriously broken in several ways---I think the difference between the 
two versions is the upgrade from S3/base to S4/grid that Martin 
Maechler & co. have been doing.

The problem with source compiling is because of wrong versiong of g77. 
Please read the Mac OS X Faq to get the latest and correct version of 
g77.

As for hexbin: it builds fine with this release of R for Mac OS X and 
related GUI (which I remember is just  a wrapper around command line 
R).

the other question is about 2.0 binaries for BioC. There was a wrong 
link to 1.9 packages instead of 2.0 packages in the macosx page on BioC 
(it was my fault as usual).

It is now fixed, so the package installer of R.app should now be able 
to get the correct version.

Hi Susan,
the complete (default set of packages of) bioc 1.5 is now available in 
binary form.
Can you please report us the errors you get and exactly what you do, 
your mac os x versio etc ?

Dear Stefano,
dear all
I have tried to get the complete bioc 1.5 in binary form from the R 
menu.
While it downloads and installs everything in my ~/Library/R/library
whenever invoked by, for example library(rama), I get an error that the 
package
is pre 2.0.0.
How do you force R downloading the right packages without recompiling 
them?
Many thanks
Anestis

it seems that some packages have not been updated by my script. I've 
now forced the complete rebuilding of all the packages, I hope it would 
be ok in a couple of days (due to mirroring).
And you are right, rama is one of the packages built for 1.9.1 and 
never updated (gosh!)

I'll file a mail to this mailing list when the complete process is over.

Stefano

Hello,

I have uppgraded to R 2.0 and to MacOS X.3.5
The new GUI is very (very) impressive but I have noticed this message when I
try to install new packages:

dyld: tar version mismatch for library: /usr/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib
(compatibility version of user: 5.0.0 greater than library's version: 4.0.0)

And then, the GUI "freeze".

I have the same problem when I use R in the "Terminal" or in "Xterm".

Have any idea on can I fix that ?

Thanks in advance.

from the shell
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib

the libiconv was needed in a old version of R for macosx. Now it shis 
with Mac OS X 10.3+, so you don't need the copy in /usr/local/lib

stefano
p.s. pressing "esc" should "defrost" the GUI

dear list,

i changed my os from win xp to mac os x (10.3) and upgraded R to Version R-2.0.0. now i would like to install a source package which contains fortran code. unfortunately it seems to that the way to compile it is not the same as under windows. under windows i used the special folder "src" and the command R CMD INSTALL ...
but no it doesn't work under mac. first: if i am not wrong there is no src folder and if i try to use R CMD INSTALL then i get this message:

(andqua@g4an:Scource)R CMD INSTALL Test -l /Users/andqua/Documents/Rlibrary/
* Installing *binary* package 'rsmooth' ...
* DONE (Test)

which is wrong because it is no binary. furthernore  the package manager tells me there is no package called Test. if i try to install this package with the package installer then i get following error message:

gzip: /Users/andqua/Documents/Rlibrary/Scource/Test.zip has more than one entry--rest ignored
ERROR: cannot extract package from '/Users/andqua/Documents/Rlibrary/Scource/Test.zip'
    npackage installation failed

i will be very happy if somebody can tell me what i am doing wrong or give me some sources to read in the internet because i do not found any hints in the R FAQ for mac os x and the faq for building packages in R.

thanks in advance
andreas

Could you post a transcript of what you're trying to do? In general OS 
X's behavior is much closer to UNIX/Linux than WinXP (especially when 
it comes to the command-line utilities).

In general, assuming you have an R package downloaded called 
"package_1_0_0.tar.gz" on your desktop you would execute the following 
from a Terminal window:

# cd ~/Desktop
# R CMD INSTALL package_1_0_0.tar.gz

The caps are very important (there is actually a system utility called 
'install') and you shouldn't actually have to unpack anything.

If you're attempting to install a FORTRAN-based package you will need 
to install g77 from hpc.sourceforge.net as it is not included in 
Apple's Developer's Tools (for some unfathomable reason. Dear Apple, 
please ship g77 with Tiger). The appropriate version number is in the 
FAQ and the installation instructions for g77 are available on its 
website.

Hi,

I'm using the R2.0 Aqua Gui version. I'm interested in creating small 
GUIs for a psychoacoustic experiments in R (using tuneR; i.e. people 
pushing buttons, and a sound is played).

However I have no experience. Googling around it seems that using tcltk 
from would be the best thing. Yet I'm a little overwhelmed at the 
bedinning by the amount of information.
Does anybody know an easy to use tutorial (best starting with 
installation) optimally with special consideration of Mac OS X users.

Best,
Nathan

dear bryon,

> Could you post a transcript of what you're trying to do? 

i try to make a package from existing r functions. that means i load the 
functions with "source()" in R and use "package.skeleton()". After it i 
add the fortran code (written under win) in the src-folder and try "R 
CMD check" which tells me the package is not a source package:

* checking for working latex ... OK
* using log directory '/Users/andqua/Documents/TMP/Test.Rcheck'
* checking for file 'Rsmooth/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
* checking if this is a source package ... ERROR
Only *source* packages can be checked.

If i try to build a tar.gz file with "R CMD build" than i get following 
message:

(andqua@g4an:Rlibrary)R CMD INSTALL Test/ -l 
/Users/andqua/Documents/Rlibrary/
* Installing *binary* package 'Test' ...
* DONE (Test)

for my understanding this should be wrong because the package is no 
binary and if i try to load this package with "library(test)" i get the 
error message that the packagae is unknown.

So i guss the problem is the fortran code (devweloped under win xp)  but 
i have no idea to solve this problem because should can compile the code 
because g77 is installed and gcc also.
Furthermore i have no administrative rights at this pc but that should 
be not a problem if i change add my own folder "Rlibrary" with 
".libPaths()" to the known libraries.

hope the descripion of my problem was more detailed now and helps to 
find a answer for my problem.
best regards
andreas

AFAIK tcl/tk doesn't work natively in OS X yet (but you can use it in 
X11), so I would not rely on it, but on the other hand, there are not 
really too many alternatives. The only cross-platform solution that 
even works natively on OS X is iWidgets in JGR ( 
http://www.rosuda.org/JGR/ - see R help pages of the iWidgets library 
for examples). iWidgets have a simple API, so it should be easy to get 
started. However, since iWidgets are really fresh, there aren't many 
projects to borrow example code from.
A native Cocoa package for the R-GUI does not exist yet, although there 
are plans to create one. If I get to write one, it will have the same 
API as iWidgets, so it will be interchangeable.
This is just my EUR 0.02 ... others may thing of other alternatives, 
and I'm aware that we need to put some effort in this area ...

Cheers,
Simon

In my version of R (http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub) Aqua Tcl/Tk works  
fine,
and Aqua Gtk+ works partially, but the R Aqui GUI and JGR do not work,  
so
you have to run R from Terminal.app or from Emacs.

If you try to compile your fortran outside of R does it succeed? This 
will help us to find out if the problem is the fortran code.

I would have to disagree with Simon here.  tcltk works reliably, with 
little configuation effort, on all R platforms (? possibly except 64-bit 
linux). The x11 version on the Mac is undeniably ugly, but it does work 
and the Apple X server is not going to suddenly vanish.

It depends on how much you want to focus on OS X.  If you really want easy 
portability then I think tcltk is the way to go (and there are quite a few 
examples of its use out there). If you mostly want use on a Mac with the 
ability to port if necessary then something prettier and more flexible 
(such as iWidgets) might be appropriate.

Hi:

I have installed a package (seacarb) and all seemed to work OK. The
package is in:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.0/Resources/library/seacarb

When I check the packages installed, I get the following warning
message:

> library()
Warning message: 
library '/Users/gattuso/Library/R/library' contains no package in:

BUT the package is listed in the window which opens subsequent to the
library command:

Packages in library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library':
.....
seacarb                    Calculates parameters of the seawater
carbonate
                           system
.....


However, none of the functions of this package work from within R Aqua
(also in an X11 window):

Error: couldn't find function "carb"

What did I do wrong?

We have just released R for Mac OS X 2.0.1

Apart from R specific news and fixing, the R.app GUI that comes with 
the installer is a major update over the first release.
Among the news and fixes: fixed drag and drop problems with ascii 
files, configurable editor, fixed a bug with R_LIBS that causes 
weirdness in package installation, new pref panes for configuring GUI 
behavior, fixed problem with symbol font handling in the Quartz 
graphics device, fixed a bug that caused excessive CPU time 
consumption.

Message-ID: <419B89A9.1080106@stat.wisc.edu>

I'm just getting started building R-devel on an Apple compute server. 
I'm familiar with Unix/Linux and especially with Debian so fink is 
familiar.  However, I don't know anything about Frameworks, etc.

I think I want to use the vecLib.framework because these machines are 
dual-processor and it looks as if the R-2.0.0 binary uses threaded BLAS 
here.  Should I be using a --with-blas=<whatever> switch to configure or 
something like that?

At present I am using

setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/sw/include"
setenv LDFLAGS "-L/sw/lib"
$R_SRC/configure \
   --with-pcre \
   --with-bzlib \
   --with-zlib \
   --with-recommended \
   --enable-R-shlib \
   --enable-R-profiling

and I am encountering problems compiling the lapack module.  I imagine 
this is due to accessing the fink version of libg77.a.  Could someone 
volunteer to do a bit of off-line hand holding for me regarding this 
problem?

Hi,

I really like the new R mac gui, but I am not sure yet if it behaves 
unexpectedly at times or if it is just my limited knowledge of R. In 
particular I did not look very much for what has changed between R 1.9 
and R 2, so I may do stupid things.

It seems to me that in the previous R on Mac (1.9), all menu selections 
resulted in feedback in the console. It does not seem to be the case 
anymore. This is confusing because getting feedback some of the time 
leaves you wondering if things are OK the rest of the time. For 
instance, in package manager, if I select mgcv, I get "This is mgcv 
1.1-8" in the console. But if I take MASS, nothing happens in the 
console.

In preferences, I don't seen a way to permanently set my working 
directory anymore. Choosing it with "change working directory" and 
saving my working directory when quitting R does not set the working 
directory permanently either.

In preferences for the quartz device, the "change" button to select a 
font does nothing.

Also, while acknowledging the immense amount of work that the authors 
of R gui have done, I would like to make a suggestion so that R gui 
would be yet more mac like. In things like Package Manager, we click on 
packages we'd like to load, but there is no button to select an action 
to be taken on our selection. We have to "close" the window and the 
packages get loaded. It is counterintuitive, in other programs if we 
close a window we cancel the selections we might have made. It would be 
clearer, I think, to have at the bottom a <cancel> and a <load> (or 
just OK) button. Do other users agree?

this is not the case anymore in R 2.0, it was like that on 1.9.x old 
GUI. Now if you check the "load" check mark, you'll see R trying to 
load the package. If everything goes right the check mark stays 
"checked" otherwise is switched back to unchecked status.

My first impression of the Cocoa GUI in 2.0.1 is very positive. Great
work. Thank you.

My favourite improvement so far is the help browser. Among other nice
things, I was happy to see that arrow keys now scroll the text. But
Command-+ does not make the font bigger yet. It only flashes a menu.
Please, make this work. (Not as urgent as resizing the Quartz device.)

In the console window, fonts resize nicely. Thank you.

There is a prominent button for letting R use root privileges. This is
really scary. Please, could the code in question be removed? Not just
hidden but removed. Don't risk the stability of my computer for some
convenience. (What is it for? To mess with the kernel?)

(The "quit" button is merely redundant.)

Message-ID: <qotllcxit6w.fsf@venus.ling.helsinki.fi>

The 2.0.1 installer is much better about permissions than versions
before 2.0, but it still changed the owner of /Applications:

User differs on ./Applications, should be 0, owner is 502
Owner and group corrected on ./Applications
Permissions corrected on ./Applications

It really should leave the owners and permissions of existing
directories alone.

I'm on 10.3.6, so I installed the version for 10.3+.

  I assume it is to allow you to install packages system wide. You can just 
not use it -- it's not a bomb that can go off accidentally. Remember that 
R can't possibly increase its own privileges, so the button uses the same 
OS interface that installers use, to get the OS to ask you for your 
permission and password. Any code on the Mac can *ask* for this, the 
security comes from the fact that the OS puts up a standard, recognizable 
prompt and the user has to explicitly give permission.  People who give 
permission without thinking will quickly destroy their computers whatever 
R does.

I wouldn't have put this in myself -- I would rely on sudo R CMD INSTALL 
or on setting up appropriate group permissions if I wanted to install 
packages system-wide.  However, if you want a GUI package installer it has 
to be able to request permission to write to protected directories, and 
the button has to be slightly safer than starting up the R GUI with admin 
privileges, if only because the privileges are invoked for a shorter time.

1.9.x didn't use Apple installer (except for the looks) - it actually 
untarred a tar ball - bad boy. The current one (2.0.0 and 2.0.1) are 
totally different specified from scratch, using PM.

Well, our packages tell Apple Installer to leave them alone. It seems 
to be a bug in Apple Installer, because from 
R-GUI.pkg/Contents/Info.plist:
         <key>IFPkgFlagOverwritePermissions</key>
         <false/>
so it shouldn't replace any existing rights. I'm pretty much at loss, 
because no package contains the Applications folder and R-GUI uses 0:80 
as owner:group - and it's respected as you can see:
Miraculix:~% ls -ld /Applications/R.app
drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102 20 Nov 00:42 /Applications/R.app

In fact UID 502 is not used anywhere in any package of the R installer. 
Is your UID on that machine 502?
We could work around it by changing the rights in post-flight but we 
instructed AI to not change them in the first place ...

Cheers,
Simon

Thomas nicely explained the reason behind the button and where your 
seem to misunderstand the way such things work and the implications.

Just for completeness, technically what happens is that the R_system 
call is authorized to run as root if authenticated as long as the lock 
is unlocked (pretty much like in all Apple applications BTW). It does 
not change the privileges of R.app itself. The main reason for this 
functionality is that there is no way to run R.app as root for 
system-wide tasks and "sudo R" does not give you necessarily the same 
environment (let alone GUI for package installation ;)).

Simon

Message-ID: <D131590E-3BC2-11D9-84FD-000393DB9466@stats.ox.ac.uk>

Just as an experiment I tried the following.  First, as the root user I 
created a file named unlink.me in /:

[muffin] /> ls -l
total 8753
<snip>
-rw-r--r--   1 root  admin       11 21 Nov 13:15 unlink.me
<snip>

Then I started up R, clicked on the lock and authenticated myself.  I 
was able the delete unlink.me with the command

 > unlink("/unlink.me")

The unlink function is defined as

 > unlink
function (x, recursive = FALSE)
{
     if (!is.character(x))
         stop("argument must be character")
     if (recursive)
         system(paste("rm -rf ", paste(x, collapse = " ")))
     else system(paste("rm -f ", paste(x, collapse = " ")))
}
<environment: namespace:base>

So when the lock is unlocked one really is only a typo away from some 
potentially serious harm (remember the iTunes installer?).  I think a 
good short term solution would be to have R ask for a password for each 
operation requiring root privileges and deauthenticate when that 
operation is complete.  It would also be good if the dialog could tell 
you what the operation is.  For instance, "R needs your password to 
install the the package ${packageName}."

Just my 2 cents.

Well, but this is true for ANY shell ran as root - with sudo R you're 
exactly in the same position, even worse as you can create files by 
writing as root (which you can't in R.app), so I don't quite get your 
point. When you authorize yourself as root, you should know what you're 
doing. As Thomas said - giving authorization without thinking will give 
any application the rights to kill your system.

Unfortunately both things are not possible. SF provides no way to 
specify a message the user should get. Secondly there is no guarantee 
that the performed operation is atomic - if you patch R_system you will 
see that it's called more than once for seemingly single operations, so 
it's not clear when to deauthenticate. We did indeed discuss the whole 
issue before implementing it :P.

So the bottom line is that the tool is pretty harmless and safe for 
regular users, as the user has to acknowledge their responsibility by 
authenticating. It could be argued whether the icon should be present 
in the bar by default (e.g. I'd propose to make it visible by default 
to admin users only), but so far I see no argument against the feature 
in general.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

I am working on adding the R.framework to darwinports 
(darwinports.opendarwin.org).  So far everything seems to be working 
fine except that when I use the Cocoa gui I get this error

Error in rm(rlibs) : can't remove variables from base namespace

at start up.  It appears as the very first thing in the command window, 
even before the copyright notice.  Other than this error (which has no 
apparent effect) everything seems to work fine.  I am using version 
2.0.1 of the R.framework.

Does anyone have any idea where this error might be coming from?

Which R framework is it? The only place I can think of is
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/base/R/Rprofile
but at least the released 2.0.1 version checks for R.app presence and 
does NOT run that code .... are you sure that you're using the latest 
version of both the R framework and R.app? (that would be R 2.0.1 and R 
GUI 1.01)

I think this one is not the same as the long-paste-problem. I suspect 
that this one was introduced by the external editor support. Rob, can 
you, please, check it? Please correct me if I'm wrong. Unfortunately 
I'm overly busy the next week [and w/o my desktop computer], so I won't 
be able to check it :(.

Gareth, can you, please, try to find a reproducible example? That would 
help localizing it more precisely .. Thanks.

Hi,

I am in the process of testing the R.framework I built using 
darwinports.  For some reason I can't seem to install packages into the 
framework using the GUI (compiled from source available yesterday).  
Everything works fine from the R.app command line though.  Anyone have 
an idea what might be going wrong?  I swear this worked yesterday.  
Thanks,

Kjell

I cannot always reproduce my fault but on it does occur  when I save a 
graph using the pulldown window.

The console window and the Quartz (2) active remain the same but my R 
is dead and needs to be restarted
- in the sense that the console window ignores further typing.

Hi,

I like to comment my programs, and often I do so in French.
But accented vowels in a R editor window get screwed up in the R 
console, so that

# exemple  suivre

becomes

 > # exemple  suivre

(other french accents become just as ugly).

I suppose this is a font encoding error. Can it be fixed, or is there 
something in R itself which prevents it from even displaying such 
characters?

Simon and Gareth,

I think this path is taken if Save As is chosen with Quartz as the key 
window. By adding
below method into the file RQuartz.m (I did it just above the 
saveDocument method) the
problem is resolved.

- (IBAction)saveDocumentAs:(id)sender
{
	[self saveDocument:nil];
}

Gareth, please let me know if you occasionally build R yourself, use 
the nightly
version from Simon or the general distribution from Stefano. If 
possible I would
like to get you a version to verify if this indeed solves the problem.

Thanks,
Rob

No, it's not "R itself", since this works in quite a few other
circumstances in other R consoles: You should be able to use
accents even in strings and plot them, see 
 > example(text)
in R, and even in R object names :

E.g. (in a Linux console):

 > Z?ri <- "exemple ? suivre" # ? suivre
 > Z?ri
 [1] "exemple ? suivre"
 >

---------
However it is -- as you write -- an encoding issue,
and probably also depending quite a bit on your so
called "Locale" settings.  To learn more, e.g., see in R

 > apropos("locale")
 [1] "Sys.getlocale"  "Sys.localeconv" "Sys.setlocale"
       
and now, e.g.,
 > ?Sys.getlocale

Here (where I mainly work with Redhat Enterprise Linux) I've
explicitly turned off the Unicode locale (UTF-8 to be specific)
and reverted to "C" (or "POSIX"), by at least setting  'LANG=C'
or 'LANG=POSIX' instead of something like 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8'.

Look at what
  > Sys.getenv("LANG")
tells you, and consider

Ok, the problem may well be with Apple's installer. I don't know these
details. I'll add a couple of details below and leave it at that.
Sorry for the delay.

Yes, that's what I have, too. Only /Applications was set to another
owner. One detail I omitted in my report was that I chose the
destination folder myself, so the installer did not know it was
installing in the default place. (I did this because it said it would
install in the folder "Macintosh HD" on the volume "Macintosh HD",
which is nonsense.)

Another detail that I omitted is that my system is localized to
Finnish, so I actually chose "Ohjelmat" as the destination. It's still
/Applications.

I don't see how these should matter, though. It was an existing
folder, with existing owner, and that owner was changed.

Yes, 502 is my admin account. I use that for installs.

Maybe just leave it alone and people can Repair Permissions when in
doubt. Though I'd like to be able to just drag and drop R.app to
/Applications and R.framework to /Library/Frameworks.

It's a bug and a feature of the R GUI ;).
Internally, R GUI uses UTF-8 encoding for text handing, including the 
editor. The idea was to have a localized GUI with support for any 
language and UTF-8 is the natively supported format in Cocoa. To make 
the mess even bigger, there was a bug in the GUI that converted the 
UTF-8 to vanilla C string at one point, thus resulting in the wrong 
behavior you spotted.

Now I have fixed that latter bug, such that your comments should appear 
undistorted now:

 > # exemple ? suivre

If this is all you need, get tonight's nightly build.
However, using UTF-8 in strings in R is not that easy. Even if all you 
want is to retain the UTF-8 contents (i.e. tell R to not worry about 
the encoding and just print back what it gets), the actual problem is 
that R escapes certain characters, regardless of the locale:

 > Sys.getlocale()
[1] "en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/C/en_US.UTF-8/C"
 > "M?ll"
[1] "M\303\274ll"

This means that the don't-worry-concept doesn't work. The latest info 
on encodings and UTF-8 I could find was for 1.8.1, but I suspect that 
nothing changed since: basically R has no UTF-8 support and there will 
be none unless someone with enough time, energy and skill will take up 
the task.

The bottom line is that I'll try to fix the GUI in a sense that it will 
use the locale-specific encoding in its internal representation and for 
all communication with R. The drawback will be that users on systems 
with different locales won't be able to use each other's files 
transparently. Still, this should fix things for users of more simple 
encodings (such as Latin1), but for more general support of UTF-8 or 
other multi-character encodings we will have to wait until there is a 
global solution in R.

Cheers,
Simon

Hello,

I am planning to compile and install R on 10.4 Tiger Preview.
Does someone already do this? If so, could you share the experience?
What would be the version of gcc and g77 (or g95) to compile R 64 bit?

Thank you very much in advance,

Some of us have tried. The couple gcc-3.5 and g77-3.4.1
does not work, and you need gcc-3.5 for 64 bit. My guess
is that someone has to recompile g95-3.5 using gcc-3.5
to get this to work (you can then also turn autovectorization
on).

I built a gcc-4.0 from the head of Apple's cvs tree this week 
(apple-gcc-4020).  It built OK with the new F95 Fortran that appears to 
work.  This compiler is not compatible with the current gcc_select, 
although it could be the default cc with some manual changes or can be 
invoked as gcc-4.0.

If anyone would like a copy of the compiler drop me an email.  I have a 
package installer.

AFAIK R uses g77 because it is Fortran 77 code (Hollerith card line 
lengths and all that.).  I don't expect the configure system would 
recognise the new Fortran 95.

64 bit stuff is another story.  The changelogs show many changes in the 
last few weeks (since the Tiger preview release) enabling 64 bit 
elements like a 64 bit libgcc.  However, these would not build on my 
computer because I did not have the necessary 64 bit ppc64 architecture 
header files.   I checked with a colleague who has a new G5 iMac with 
Tiger preview and he does not have the headers either.  So I guess we 
need to wait for a Developer Tools update before 64bit compilation of 
user level code becomes an option.

The compiler will build 64 bit code now.  Just use the -m64 option.  
However the C and Fortran runtime libraries are crucial to any real 
program.

Do you really need 64 bit code?

Using the Mac GUI, R version 2.0.1 (as well as 2.0.0), the undo command 
undoes way too much.  I have had times where I was editing code, made a 
typo, unconsciously hit undo, and saw the entire document disappear.  
Other times it goes back to what looks like the state when I opened the 
file during the current session.  Thankfully the redo command works, 
but this scares me every time it happens, my peace of mind would be 
helped by making the undo command a bit less aggressive.

My apologies if this is a known issue.

Hi

sometimes when trying to select text with the mouse in either the R 
console or an editor script, there's no way to do it. It's still 
possible to select in some other areas, but in others it isn't. 
Noting that important, but it has happened once in a while.

I also get the undo key "extreme" behaviour mentioned in an earlier 
posting. And that's scary!

thanks to all the people that have done this wonderful work.

I have something only partially related to add: I'd like to select text 
in the console and delete it. In other words, after spending time 
making a program just right, my console window is full of my failed 
attempts. I'd like to remove the unwanted material (actually I'd like 
better to just "clear" the console, maybe leaving the R version number 
that is put there when opening R) and rerun my complete, debugged 
program to have a clean output for archiving. As of now the novice that 
I am had to quit R and reopen it to run my debugged program.

In short I'm not reporting a bug but asking for a feature, just a menu 
command to "clear the console".

Sincerely,

Denis Chabot

That indeed seems a very useful feature. Oftentimes I cut&paste the 
output of the
latest run into an editor window and then print/save it. Now, with the 
save R Console
option, a 'clear R console' feature would be even more valuable.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] A few niggles with the new R interface
Message-ID: <f8e6ff05041127091365306ee0@mail.gmail.com>

I really like the new R interface (it's a vast improvement over
RAqua), but there are a few little niggles that I find rather
frustrating:

 * When restarting or shuting down the whole computer, R always
cancels the shut down process

 * R activity doesn't stop my computer from going to sleep

 * Sometimes when using cmd-` to rotate through active windows, all
the other windows are shuffled to the back of any other open
applications - this is frustrating when switching been help and code. 
However, this doesn't happen consistency, and I haven't been able to
figure out what triggers it.

 * help(package = "MASS") doesn't do anything

 * using stop (or pressing cmd-.) won't break out of a loop that uses try()

why don't simply use the sink() feature of R to save the output of your 
scripts?

Hi

Another little thing: sometimes - no always and I cannot link it to 
any special operation - when I press delete, the whole editor clears. 
There still seems to be text in there - that sometimes flashes, but I 
cannot retrieve it (what I have been doing is to close the window, 
not save it and open it again - loosing the changes I have made 
meanwhile)

also, I don't know whether this type of little things should be 
directly sent to the mailing list or to some other place, let me know 
if there's some other way to report this little things - and I 
apologize for any wrong use of the mailing list

Hi, thanks for the feedback.
This mailing list is the right place where to send reports.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] browser,  editor, .RData
Message-ID: <p06100500bdd0e6763d61@[83.132.29.55]>

Dear R-MacList:

some little things:

a) when trying to open the workspace browser:
it happens once in a while that I get error messages like:
Error in .subset2(x, i) : subscript out of bounds
this happens after I load tables that are not that huge: 14010x30

b) I would find useful to be able to see the .RData files that are 
produced in each folder. I know I can access them and delete them in 
the UNIX terminal and even proudly know how to do that, but it would 
be easier to see them in the folders and to delete them - if that's 
the case - in that more usual way

c) with the editor it would be great to be have a short cut to have 
the line passed into the console and go to the next line without 
having to select them. having the two options would be the best: if 
the nothing would be selected the shortcut would pass that line and 
move to the next one, if something would be selected only the 
selection would be passed to the console

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Strange behaviour when setting proxy?
Message-ID: <41AB3A3F.6080700@rcsi.ie>

Is it possible to set proxy information permanently? Does R have a 
startup file that it will execute which will do things like proxy 
setting or changing working directory? (Sorry if this is a very newbie 
question, but I am a very newbie...)

It would be nice to add proxy settings to the GUI, as it took me a long 
time to track down the information on how to do it from the 
documentation, and it's a big stumbling block in getting R set up on OS X.

However, I also have this odd behaviour on 2.0.1 running on 10.3.6

I accidentally issued the command

Sys.putenv("http_proxy"="http://proxy.rcsi.internal.ie")

Realising my error (a period instead of an underscore) I issued the 
command correctly

Sys.putenv("http_proxy"="http://proxy.rcsi-internal.ie")

However, R persisted in trying the first proxy. Experimenting with this, 
it seems that R allows me to put a definition for the proxy just once, 
and the only way of recovering from an error is to exit R and restart.

Is this a bug or a feature?
