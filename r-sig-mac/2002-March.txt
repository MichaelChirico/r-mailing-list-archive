Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Writing R doc on Mac
Message-ID: <f05101400b8a4e230ae16@[134.214.32.58]>

Hello,

What is the best way to write R documentation on Mac ? Is it better
to write it under Windows/Unix/MacOS X ? Which are the best tools ?
I already have some documentation in MS Word files (in R doc style),
which I'd like to use. I suppose that there is no automatic Word
(rtf or txt) to .Rd translation program ?

Thanks,
Jean

After having used lm(), I encountered some odd results in the Darwin 
version (Mac G4, OS X Version 10.1.3). Then I tried out this (in the 
Darwin and the Carbon version):

Darwin version (1.4.0):

Are there any explanations, why one can get 4 different results

There isn't any automatic translation, but Rd files are plain text, like
.txt, so this shouldn't be a problem.

The prompt() command will produce a nice skeleton for a .Rd file and then
any text editor should be fine.  I use Emacs on Linux and Windows and
TextEdit on OS X. The logical choice for OS 8/9 is probably Alpha,
although Word should be fine as long as you save the file in text format.

Unix is probably the best platform for *processing* .Rd files, as Unix
systems tend to have all the necessary tools built in.

This is correct (2.442e-15 is zero by any reasonable definition)

The problem here is that you have the same expression on both sides of the
formula, so R will drop it from the RHS.  You would see the same thing
with
  lm(dummy1~dummy1)

Getting 22 is a bug, but not one that you should normally encounter

Same correct answer as a

Correct answer after dropping the response from the RHS

In fact there are three different results and two of them are correct.

I can't reproduce (b) on any other system I have access to, but it does
seem to be a bug. Anyone else with 1.4.0 on Darwin find this? Does it
still happen with
	lm(c(1:10)~1)
which would be much more serious?

Here is a couple of other different results (Darwin, version 1.4.1 -- by 
the way
upgrading will correct some problems).
===========================================================
 > dummy1 <- c(1:10)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)
         5.5
===========================================================
 > lm((c(1:10))~(c(1:10)))

Call:
lm(formula = (c(1:10)) ~ (c(1:10)))

Coefficients:
(Intercept)      c(1:10)
   1.221e-15    1.000e+00
===========================================================
It looks to me there is no problem, everything gives (0,1), except for
lm(c(1:10)~c(1:10)), which may not be legal R (by the way, I also
get 5.5 with the Solaris version). The examples below illustrate the
problem is with naming the dependent  variable c(1:10)
===========================================================

 > lm(c(1:10)~(c(1:10)))

Call:
lm(formula = c(1:10) ~ (c(1:10)))

Coefficients:
(Intercept)
         5.5

 > lm((c(1:10))~c(1:10))

Call:
lm(formula = (c(1:10)) ~ c(1:10))

Coefficients:
(Intercept)      c(1:10)
   1.221e-15    1.000e+00

O, good. So 5.5 is not a bug and lm(c(1:10)~c(1:10)) is legal R,
but only fits the intercept. I don't have any R-1.4.0 versions left,
but someone reported a similar lm bug in Darwin 1.4.0 recently.

Message-ID: <63C8562C-2EEB-11D6-8A9C-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

Options:

1. Run the Carbon version of R (available from CRAN). You don't need
anyhting else. You don't even need OS X. This version of R is relatively
slow, compared to the Darwin based versions, and it misses various
components (tcl/tk, internet upgrading and installing, ATLAS). It does
have its own menus, of course.

2. Run the Darwin version of R in a Terminal window. If you want graphics
you can use the devices such as pdf, postscript, xfig which write to a
file. If you want graphics output to the screen, run your X11 server in
rootless mode and run the X11() command in R. This will open an X11
graphics device on your Aqua desktop. If you use the XTools or XOroborus
window manager,  then your X11 windows will look like the rest of your 
Aqua
desktop.

3. Run the Darwin version of R in an Xterm (or Eterm, or whatever
X11 terminal emulator you use). This can be done both in rootless
and full screen mode. It sets the graphics device to X11()
automatically. In this option you can use the various window
managers to make your desktop look like a GNOME or
Next desktop, if you are so inclined.

4. Run the GNOME version of R. This can be done by saying "R --gui=GNOME"
in an Xterm window, or in the Terminal window if there already is an
X server running. This gives R its own window, with various menus. Of
course you can run this on the Aqua desktop on in full-screen X11 mode.
The GNOME version is "experimental", and some of the menus do not
work. The fink version of R does not have GNOME support. You can
run the GNOME version of R in full-screen mode using the complete
GNOME or nautilus desktop (both are in Fink).

5. Run XEmacs, with ESS installed. You can get the latest version of
XEmacs from Fink (same for X11 versions of GNU Emacs). This will run
R in an Emacs window. It gives you all the usual Emacs menus and
commands, plus some extra menus specifically for R. You can split
the window and run R in one buffer and edit R in another buffer (and
you can evaluate pieces of R code in the second buffer conveniently).
The device is automatically set to X11, and again you can use rootless
and full-screen.

6. Run the Carbon version of GNU Emacs (also in Fink) with ESS
installed. This runs on the Aqua desktop, so you need to run your
X server in rootless mode, and you need to tell R (running in the
Emacs window) that X11(display="localhost:0.0"). This will open an
X11 graphics device.

7. For insane people: if you have Virtual PC running, you can also
run the Windows version of R. If you have an X11 server running within
Virtual PC, you can duplicate most of the options above. If you
have a Macintosh emulator running in your X11 server, you can have
real fun.

For most of my work I use option 2 or option 6. It is also clear what
is missing most painfully: a Quartz graphics device for the Aqua 
desktop. This
would allow you to use options 2 and 6 without having to use X11 at
all. As far as I know, you cannot run the Quickdraw (macintosh()) device
from the Darwin version (that would already be quite nice).

Good Morning !

I am trying to run R on MacOS X using XFree86 4.2.0 on a G4 867, 512 
Mb, running MacOS X 10.1.3, fink and R-project version 1.4.0. The 
files where downloaded from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/.
When I try to run it, I get the following error message

"dyld: /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.bin version mismatch for library:

than library's version: 1.0.10)
".

I hope you have some ideas what the problem is and how I can fix it.

thanks for your help

I got that error too when trying to run R1.4.0 from CRAN. I then used FINK
to compile/install R and it worked fine. Took a long time to compile on
my 500Mhz iMac, though.

It seems that the problem might be related.  I thought that the BLAS

Confirmed here for the Matrix package. You can make it install by doing the
following from your shell (got this tip from Jeff Whitaker):

setenv LDFLAGS -L/sw/lib
R INSTALL Matrix_0.3-16.tar.gz

I guess that this should take care of the other package, too.

The problem is that the -L flag (location of binary libraries) is set to
/usr/local/lib, which is wrong for Fink (should be /sw/lib). As a matter of
fact, this should not happen with the newest Fink R version 1.4.1-1, since
Jeff Whitaker (the Fink R manintainer) fixed it. If you look at the file
/sw/lib/R/etc/Makeconf, you should find a line LDFLAGS = -L/sw/lib in there.
I have no idea why it doesn't get used for the installation of this package,
though - it solved similar problems for other packages (e.g. KernSmooth)

I will no longer maintain the Darwin/X11 version, since

(a) You can get a better version from fink -- in particular
if you set up fink properly you will not have the missing dylib
problems.

(b) I have agreed with Jeff Whitaker (fink R maintainer)
that he will put r-base, r-base-atlas, r-base-gnome, and 
r-base-atlas-gnome
in fink.

(c) I have agreed with Stefano that we will get working on
an Aqua GUI for R and he will get working on a Quartz device.
This will mean Quartz/Aqua wrappers around the
Darwin/X11 version of R, best of both worlds.

(d) I have agreed with Jeff that we will start putting R packages
into the fink system. He has already installed rpy, which
went without a glitch, and which now allows one to use
all of R from python.

Message-ID: <a05101500b8b1779b5305@[12.232.130.78]>

I've seen a mention of R 1.4.1 being available from fink, but when I 
do "fink list" I get this:

  i  r-base          1.4.0-3     Environment for statistical computing and g...
  i  r-recommended   1.4.0-2     Recommended add-on packages for R ('GNU S').

This is as of today, 10 March 2002, having run fink self-update yesterday.

In other words: I don't know of anything I'm doing wrong with regard 
to using fink; at least one recent post to R-sig-mac has indicated 
that 1.4.1 is present on fink; yet I don't see it.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

Does the Trees line in your /sw/etc/fink.conf say

Trees: local/main stable/main stable/crypto unstable/main 
unstable/crypto local/bootstrap

because R-1.4.1 is still in unstable.

This is quite ambitious, and I'm generally supportive. I think there 
are probably a lot of Mac users for whom this would make it more 
likely they would use R.

I do have one question. Would the ability to work in X11 mode go away?

Here's why I ask. Standard practice in the Mac windowing environment 
has always been that the window that receives keyboard input MUST be 
on top. When I'm using R, I find this restriction extremely annoying 
and counter-productive. I normally have the graphics window partially 
covering the top right of my command input window. That way I can 
make the graphics window larger. Many, if not most, X11 window 
managers have an option to allow this (it goes by various names; 
"follow-focus" is one, because focus follows the mouse). Please, 
please, please, if at all possible, have the "Quartz/Aqua" wrapper 
allow follow-focus. In all likelihood, "input window on top" is so 
ingrained in Apple's world-view that it won't be possible, in which 
case my request is to allow continued use in X11 mode.

To put it briefly, given a choice between X11 mode allowing 
follow-focus, and an Aqua mode that doesn't, this is a matter of 
personal preference that I feel strongly about, and I would choose 
the X11 mode.

No, I dont think X11 would go away. If you would start R from  the 
command line in an
Xterm you would still be able to use the X desktop.

Don,

the follow-focus can be implemented by some small utilities at system 
level. There was something similar even under old MacOS. So I don't 
think this is really something you can discouraged about in using and 
Aqua/Quartz R.

But be confident, the X11 version will not be abandoned in any case.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]pdf plots from Darwin/X11 R
Message-ID: <60B54794-36BA-11D6-8498-00039364CC92@stat.ucla.edu>

If you set the device to pdf() in the Darwin/X11 version of
R, and then make a plot, then the letters in the plot will
not show up in the Preview Application (and if you
include the pdf in a TeX file using TeXShop, they will
not show up in the TeXShop previewer). Also, if you
print, the text wuill not show up. All you will see are the
little rectangles in which the letter should be.

On the other hand, if you look at the pdf file in
Acrobat, or if you look at the pdf produced by TeXShop
in Acrobat, and if you print from Acrobat, then
everything looks fine.

The solution is to set the device using pdf(enc="MacRoman").

Hy,

this is just to say that I have added the system() function to Carbon R. 
Of course, it will work only when R is launched under MacOS X.

Peter, this version works for me (both Carbon and Darwin R). You should 
better not cut strings.
