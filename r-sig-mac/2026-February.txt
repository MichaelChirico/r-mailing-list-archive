but https://mac.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.5/ has

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Updating packages from RStudio
Message-ID: <CABkCotT_4Go5geuaHx1hezH3WK3tcwz5dvYvOunaLHVvyCeN7Q@mail.gmail.com>

When I try to update packages from RStudio using the menu on macOS, some
packages fail to install.

I can fix the issue by reinstalling them manually from source, for example:

install.packages("car", type = "source")
I am wondering whether this is a known macOS/RStudio issue (e.g., related
to binary vs source packages), and whether there is a recommended
workaround or setting.

R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31) -- "[Not] Part in a Rumble"
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20

I've never seen a failure in those circumstances.

You should post full details of the next failure:  what you did, what 
versions of R and RStudio you were using, what went wrong.

There's a good chance this is purely an RStudio bug, in which case it 
would be off-topic here, so if you can reproduce the problem using 
R.app, that would be important.

G?bor,

$ curl -sS  https://mac.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.5/PACKAGES | grep -A1 'Package: pkgload'
Package: pkgload
Version: 1.5.0

so it was apparently temporary. 

That said, it shouldn't happen, because PACKAGES are synced only *after* the binaries are copied but before the old versions are deleted:

    rsync --exclude PACKAGES\* -av $BASE/$TARGET/bin/$ver/ mac.R-project.org:/$CRAN/bin/macosx/$TARGET/contrib/$ver/
    rsync --delete-after -av $BASE/$TARGET/bin/$ver/ mac.R-project.org:/$CRAN/bin/macosx/$TARGET/contrib/$ver/

so in the interim there should be still two versions of the packages available until PACKAGES is updated (i.e. you should see both pkgload 1.4.1 and 1.5.0 in the listing).

Did you see the 00_COPYING? file in the listing? That would indicate a sync in progress, but still, it shouldn?t be inconsistent. If you see something like this again, please send the full output of
curl https://mac.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.5/
to me so I can check what state the files are in at the lime when you are looking at it.

Thanks,
Simon

I have seen RStudio get confused occasionally on student machines. 

A potential source of trouble is that RStudio hooks some off their own bookkeeping into the install.packages() function and it gets confused. 

It may help to retry the installation from R in a terminal window, or simply to force the original version of the function by using utils::install.packages. I suspect it is not necessary to install from source (which could involve a lot of trouble for packages where you need the entire toolchain with compilers etc.)

It is also possible that you just ran into a temporary situation where the binary package hasn't been updated yet or the PACKAGES file in the CRAN directory has gotten out of sync with the actual content. I notice that "car" is published 2026-02-03 (because change of maintainer, I suppose). In that case, just waiting should work.

Since car was released not so long ago, I am fairly sure that this is
an issue with the CRAN metadata, similar to what I (and many others)
see for newly released packages:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2026-February/015335.html

I wrote some code to show the packages for which the metadata is inconsistent:
https://gist.github.com/gaborcsardi/797472e42b43d2f938f852614f2a170f
(Update the URL for a different arch or R version.)
Seems like car should be fine now, assuming this already propagated to
your mirror.

FWIW AFAIR all RStudio does is calling install.packages() so if you
see a 404 there, it is unlikely that it is a problem with RStudio.
Nevertheless I agree that it is always a good idea to test your code
in a plain R console.

No, I am fairly sure that I did not see 00_COPYING...

I put the output of curl here, together with some code that shows what
packages are currently inconsistent, if any:
https://gist.github.com/gaborcsardi/797472e42b43d2f938f852614f2a170f

When I try to install a package directly using install.packages() on macOS,
I get the following error:

install.packages("ggiraph")

https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.5/ggiraph_0.9.3.tgz

The downloads complete successfully, but the installed versions are older
than the current CRAN versions. As a result, when I try to update packages
again, they all remain listed as needing updates.

Reinstalling the same packages from source (e.g.,
install.packages("ggiraph", type = "source")) does update them correctly.

That is just CRAN "churnaround", ggiraph 0.9.4 was published _today_ and the binary builders haven't gotten to it yet. Remember that recompilation of CRAN packages may involve recompilation of a packages reverse dependencies, so it may take a while to get to your favourite package.

You may get som traction from install.packages(....., type="binary") or options(pkgType="binary") so that the system doesn't confuse itself with newer source packages.

Well, for many years now, still in my 2026 version of RStudio,
they (now "Posit") put  **their own** version of install.packages in the user's search() path;
they do it "smartly" and set it's environment still to
asNamespace("utils") such that printing it looks normal at first
(and also in order for the function to see internal utils
functionality which should ...):

If you type `install.packages` (*without* '(..)') to print its definition to the console, 
in the R console in Rstudio, Menu [Help] --> [About RStudio]
showing popup menu

      RStudio
      2026.01.0 Build 392
      ? 2009-2026 Posit Software, PBC

with small print (in two lines; the mail software will wrap the
relatively long lines), hence I'm adding a line '-----------------' 
between the two) :

------------------------------

If you instead look at  utils::install.packages
you see that it has a completely different body, but identical
arguments,
also in RStudio's function they construct a call to utils::install.packages,
i.e., in principle it *is* "just" a wrapper about R's function;
but I have seen several (somewhat special) cases, where the
result of the two different functions *was* different.

and now, not "nevertheless",  but really because you get the
true install.packages() function from utils, rather than RStudio / Posit's version
which does its own things in addition to what the
utils::install.packages function would do.
