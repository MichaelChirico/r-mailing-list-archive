I am impressed!

I have R 1.4.1 installed on a remote Solaris system, and R 1.4.0 
installed on my desktop Macintosh running OS X.

I did some work using R on the Solaris system, i.e., read some data, 
wrote some functions to do things with the data, including x11 
graphics.

I mounted the Solaris directories where I did the work on my Mac 
using NFS. Running R 1.4.0 on my Mac in the mounted directories, 
using the data and functions created with R 1.4.1 on the Solaris box, 
works like a charm. No need to actually transfer the .RData files 
from one computer to the other.

Congratulations and thanks to the R core team and other contributors 
for this achievement.

Hi

I usually work on the same .RData in windows and linux whithout any
problem, for a long time.

This is one of preferred features in R.

In my opinion R is one of the best examples in cross-platform
compatibility.

Best regards, thanks and keep the good work.

For the record, complete cross-platform compatibility is not guaranteed
until 1.5.0, although all known platforms support XDR (the last piece of
the jigsaw, which we supply in 1.5.0).

All platforms have been able to read files with all line endings (LF,
CRLF, even CR from a Mac) for a long time.

Hi
I was wondering if anyone could advise on which port of R to OS X (Carbon or
Darwin) is faster for running long loops as encountered in MCMC.

Generally, the Darwin version is quite a bit faster. Especially
for linear algebra, but also for loops and iterative processes.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]fink info files for R packages
Message-ID: <3109F68E-517A-11D6-A738-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

fink.sourceforge.net has R-1.4.1 as packages r-base and r-recommended
(mained by Jeff Whitaker, jsw@cdc.noaa.give)

One of our projects is to put as many R packages as possible into our
local fink tree, i.e. create /sw/fink/dists/local/R. I am not sure
if we should burden fink with 200 additional packages. Although they
all could go in libs/rpacks. Anyway, this directory
will contain info and perhaps patch files for the CRAN and other
packages. If packages have the appropriate R structure, then the
fink info file simply is, for example, acepack-1.3-1.info

===========================================================
Package: acepack
Version: 1.3
Revision: 1
Depends: r-base
Source: http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/src/contrib/%n_%v.tar.gz
SourceDirectory: %n
CompileScript: echo "no compile script"
InstallScript:  R CMD INSTALL %b
Description: ace() and avas() for selecting regression transformations
License: GPL
Maintainer: Jan de Leeuw <deleeuw@stat.ucla.edu>
Homepage: http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html#acepack
===========================================================

If packages are not packaged appropriately, other info files will be 
needed
(with the usual configure and make commands, with CFLAGS, or with
R CMD INSTALL parameters).

We can group packages by making a virtual package which does not install
anything but depends on its component packages (such as recommended,
CRAN, Lindsay, OmegaHat). Currently, r-recommended  has all the R CMD
INSTALL commands in the InstallScript section, but this makes it harder 
to
patch and document individual packages.

The first thing to do is to be able to build R itself.

I suggest you to start with the forthcoming release of R 1.5.0.
It has new and more efficient way to build the code and the packages.

Once R 150 is out, look at the source code in the directory 
src/macintosh and read the file INSTALL inside this folder.
There you find step by step procedure to build R. You don't need to 
build R on your own, but you have to fit all the requirements in terms 
of compiler and libraries (look at the section REQUIREMENTS). When you 
have done, you'll be able to build your package by simply using one of 
the makefiles you will find in the src/library/<package>/src  folder and 
adapting it to your needs (is changing the library name and the list of 
file names to compile).

For what concerns a R package you have to look at the "Writing R-exts" 
manual.

For any particular problem you can then ask me or Jean Thioulouse 
<Jean.Thioulouse@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr> who is helping me with package 
mantaining.

I have just updated the CRAN with the latest build of R 150.
The archive also contains all the base and recommended packages.

It will be mirrored in a couple of days or so.

Contributed packages will follow in few days.

Here the Changes for version 1.5.0

		Macintosh-specific changes to R
		===============================

rm150
=====

* using dev.off() when a user close a windows instead
   of killing directly the device
* changed MPWBuild to take care of changes in the src/include
   directory
* fixed a bug with path length (Thanks to T.Lumley)
* fixed a problem with building help files. In particular,
   html help files now have correct links
* added system() functionality under MacOS X. When R is
   running under MacOS X, it is now possibile to run BSD
   shell commands via the system() R command. Very limited
   at the moment but working.
* fixed the problem with the error message: "negative length vectors
   are not allowed". Now you should not experiment this anymore.
* MacZip not needed anymore.


Note for developers:
--------------------

For the people who want to build R from sources: you should the replace 
the file src/macintosh/MPWBuild with the one you find in this prebuilt 
distribution of R for Macintosh. See details in the file README_MAC.TXT 
inside rm150 folder.
