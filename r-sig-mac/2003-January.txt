We already had Qt/Mac

http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/

and we now have

http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/

Both are native Carbon ports, providing the Aqua interface. Both
allow you to continue to write in C, not Objective-C. Code written
for these systems compiles on Mac, Windows, and X11 (Linux) systems
(provided they also have Qt or GTK+ installled).

There is also

http://gtk-quartz.sourceforge.net/

which uses Cocoa and Objective-C, but this project is not as far
along and may be stalled.

GTK+ is free, Qt is commercial (although the X version is free). There
is an RGTK module to make GTK+ programs directly from R, which means
that if RGTK is linked with the new native GTK and GDK frameworks,
it does not need an X server and produces Aqua applications.

It may also mean that with some tweaking "R --gui=gnome" can be
made to run in a native Aqua GUI window.

By the way, there is also good news for people use use X11 for
visualization etc on the Mac: the latest CVS versions of Xfree86
now have hardware-accelerated GLX (i.e. OpenGL). There will be
binaries on gifi.stat.ucla.edu later this week.

Following from R-Sig-Mac digest #238 ...
I installed R as suggested in R.pdf "4. Exit Gifi".
On starting R with

R --gui=gnome

The system works reasonably but demo(graph) plots several demo graphs 
and their labeling off its window and the problem can not be cured by 
simple resizing the screen.  This is only a bug when using gnome.  When 
using the regular Xterm invocation of R all demo(graphs) behave as they 
should.

I assume this is a problem with gnome?  Is this problem catalogued and 
solved yet?

Confirmed. It is not your version of R or environment or the window  
manager
(happens in OroborOSX, sawfish, blackbox). So it must be R-gnome, or
gnome from fink, or gnome itself. Would be good if it could be  
verified/falsified
on other gnome systems.

Message-ID: <D7B9F536-1F72-11D7-A298-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

If you want to try Rpy-0.3 on OS X there is a nice example of overkill
on

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

This has macpython-2.3.tar.gz which includes pyobjc, Numeric,
numarray, wxPython, and Rpy, all in a framework build. You
can do python from the command line, from pythonIDE or
IDLE, or from pycrust and pyshell using wxPython. Then you
can load Rpy, make sure there is an X server running, and
do R and R graphics from python.

The file is more than 30MB (most of it is wxPython). This means
you can also do Cocoa and wxWindows programming from
this Python build.

For those who are interested, the site also contains recent builds
of gcc-3.3 and Emacs-21.3.50 and xfree86-4.2.99.3 (CVS build
with hardware GLX support).

Message-ID: <6549EB24-1FA7-11D7-8087-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

Couple of things.

1. To do X11 graphics from Rpy you need to have XDarwin or OroborOSX
running. libR.dylib is compiled with support for the default graphics
device, which is X11.

2. Rpy does not load in pycrust or pyshell, because the symbol
_unz_copyright is defined in libR.dylib and libwx_mac-2.4.0.dylib.
This can be hacked away (by changing dounzip.c in the R distribution)
but it's not a nice solution.

3. Come to think of it, the pycrust and pyshell scripts in  
/usr/local/bin
do not work at all, because wxPython is not 100% compatible with
MacPython-2.3 installation. This is easy to fix. Just change the exec  
line
in pycrust to

exec  
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/ 
Python.app/Contents/MacOS/python /usr/local/bin/pycrust.py

and the one in pyshell to

exec  
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/ 
Python.app/Contents/MacOS/python /usr/local/bin/pyshell.py

4. You can run the Rpy examples using "/usr/local/bin/python  
faithful.py" etc. And you can do Rpy programming from the
command line in /usr/local/bin/python.

5. You cannot do X11 graphics from Rpy from IDLE or PythonIDE, but you  
can do png and ps and pdf and jpeg etc, by
using r.pdf(), for instance.

6. You cannot do tcl/tk graphics from Rpy, even if python is running on  
the command line. The command
r.library('tcltk') works fine, but running the demos confuses Python  
(or R or both). You can of course do your
computing in R and your tk (or wxWindows or Cocoa) plotting in Python.

I now managed to do graphics from PythonIDE in interactive mode.
Basically, you have to set the display explicitly. So

from rpy import *
r.x11(display='gifi.stat.ucla.edu:0.0')

IDLE still bombs, more precisely the python used by IDLE bombs.

Message-ID: <EAB1A589-20D5-11D7-9038-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

This refers to earlier emails about the MacPython-2.3 build (with
pyobjc, Rpy, wxPython) on http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

If you want to use Rpy (R from Python) in Pycrust or Pyshell (the
Python GUI's that come with wxPython) then you have to recompile
libR.dylib by commenting out the two lines in src/main/dounzip.c
that use the variable unz_copyright (just put // at the beginning of the
line). This solves the problem that unz_copyright is already
defined in the wxWindows dynamic libraries. Now Rpy loads fine
and you can R away from Pycrust (including X11 plotting).

Some of you may wonder why it is good to R from Python. The
brief answer is that you can also Python from Python -- i.e. you
can do many other things from the same GUI that you cannot do
in R (Cocoa programming, wxWindows programming), and
you can also combine all this in Python scripts. And you
basically get a bunch of new GUI's for R for free: on OS X these are
IDLE, PythonIDE, Pycrust/Pyshell, and the command-line
interfaces provided by python and pythonw.

   Don't know if this has become public knowledge yet (it wasn't in the
MacWorld Expo keynote), but Apple have just released a public beta
X11 package based on Xfree86.

http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/

   Apparently there are some issues with existing installations of
XDarwin and OroborosX, but if you have a clean slate and are looking
to move to the X11 version of R, this could be the ticket.

This build and runs fine in the Darwin/X11 version for Mac OS X. It  
does require some
hacking of RGtk. Basically, you need to build RGtk both as the bundle  
RGtk.so
and as the static archive libRGtk.a This is necessary to be able to  
build
RGtkExtras and RGtkGlade and so on. Binaries will be in the next

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Tcl/tk on OS X Jaguar
Message-ID: <3E2811DC.3060906@rz.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear all,

We want to use tcl/tk  (tk esp) on a Macintosh to simplify access to our 
R scripts. We have
the OS X and classic mac version of R (1.6) installed, but it doesn't 
seem to support tcl/tk.

We then tried to install the OS X / Darwin version (1.5), but although 
we got a "installation
succesfully completed" message, we cannot find the R directories, 
binaries, etc.

Question 1: Do we need the OS X specific version of R for tcl/tk support?
Question 2: How come the OS X version does not install?

We're running a Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) computer, with X11 installed and 
a Mac native tcl/tk.

Thank you very much for your help.

--Fernando

I believe that's correct--or was at one time--perhaps the carbonized 
(not just classic) version now supports tcltk.

You might as well go for the latest version, 1.6.2.

On my OS X Mac, I installed the Darwin R from source code, and the 
final step, the "make install" step, put things here

[322]% which R
/usr/local/bin/R

and here
[323]% ls /usr/local/lib/R
./           .DS_Store*   COPYING      COPYRIGHTS   NEWS         THANKS

It does install, but it took me several tries to get it right, the 
first time I did it.

Your fastest route to tcltk support is probably to get Jan's binaries from here
http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

I installed tcltk from fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/) in order 
to get tcltk functionality in R, the R I built from sources. But 
check Jan's website first.

It is easy to get native (non-X11) tcl/tk support in the Darwin version
of R (in the sense that you can run the tk demos and so on) but since
Darwin R runs from the terminal window there is no way to get the
tk windows to the foreground. In order to do that R has to be
embedded in a Cocoa application, so that the events are handled
correctly by the OS X windowmanager (in particular SetFrontProcess).

So the easy way out is to use the Darwin/X11 version, for instance
the one on gifi (which will be upgraded later today with pmg,
RGtkExtra, RGtkHTML, RGtkGlade, RGdkPixbuf).

I removed the X11 dylibs from the page, because you can/must now install

not yet. I hope to implement it for 1.7.0.

there is also the opportunity to use the REventLoop package but I have  
not had time to implement it.

If you have downloaded rm162.sit dated Jan 17 please update the
"methods" library that you find in the archive "methods4rm162.sit" on 
CRAN.

If you have downloaded "rm162.sit" after Jan 19,  you don't need
to update the methods library.


Follow these steps:

1. Uncompress the archive
2. move the "methodsLib" file to rm162/library/methods/libs folder

I apologize.

                         Stefano M. Iacus



p.s. Changes will appear on CRAN in a day or two due to mirroring.

It seems that the built of the VGAM package for R 1-6-2 does not work 
properly, i.e. some examples won't run.
This is not specific to Mac (either Carbon or Darwin) build of R.
The author of the package is working on this.
What you get is usually something like this

fink :-)) I've finally got the gifi version of R 1.6.2 running on my 
iBook. To get things working I needed libjpeg, libpng (R did not like 
the versions that I had built, giving the dreaded dyld incompatibility 
error).

To get GNOME working it looks like I still need libgmodule.

Hope that helps with rbin-dylibs.tar.gz and gnome-dylibs.tar.gz :-)

Thanks for the builds!

Have you actually tried the R Corba interface?  Unless it's been
updated, it doesn't really work (not with the recent version of
Orbacus, which might not even be available  -- it had a pretty
restrictive license).  

At one point, I'd made progress with getting OmniORB to work, which
might be a better approach, but it isn't finished (and is based on
an early version 3, not the current version 4, or the "last" version
3).

I have just uploaded on CRAN a patch for Carbon R 1.6.2. The file is 
called rm162_patched.sit and contains only the R binary. Just repleace 
this with the original one you already have.

This patch fixes the problem with the cross-platform bug introduced in 
R-1.6.2 concerning read.table() see PR#2485. The patch (by Brian Ripley 
and me for the Carbon side) works for Darwin R too.

I have also updated the full archive of rm162.sit that now has a file 
date of Jan 22. You don't need any patch if you download this.

I'm having a problem with the Rggobi library. I've installed R1.6.2 
using Jan de Leeuw's binaries and separately I have installed ggobi. 
The binaries include the Rggobi package. However when I try to access 
it in R I get

 > library(Rggobi)
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
         unable to load shared library

Has anyone else had this problem?

Has anyone successfully installed the yags package under Darwin? When 
I install it I get
.
.
.
you will need to have
/sw/lib/R/library/yags/libs
[or the current --library or -l destination]
as an element of LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
or create a version of libu.so (e.g., using yags.make.libu)
and have an LD_LIBRARY_PATH entry superior to that version

.
.
.
I'm not sure whether those warnings are lethal or not. As recommended 
in the note, I type
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /sw/lib/R/library/yags/libs

The problem is that both libu.so and yags.so are build as bundles
using R SHLIB. But libu should be a dylib, loaded dynamically by  
yags.so, as
far as I can see. Same problem happens with other packages such as
tkrplot. Means you have to build manually and tweak on the way.

Hi there -

I am on a PBG4 1ghz, running R1.61, fink, etc.

I am trying to install Frank Harrell's Design and HMISC libraries for 
R.  I have downloaded to packages to /Users/~me/tmp, and then run sudo 
R CMD INSTALL....

I get the following error/output.

My guess is that I am missing somthing for g77 or gcc to work right?  I 
also get this error running install.packages() for the fields package 
and a few others on cran.

any help is much appreciated.

Jan can probably give you the definitive answer...and I might be 
revealing my ignorance!

Looks to me like the key message is this:
   ld: can't locate file for: -lreadline
In other words, libreadline is not being found.

readline can be installed using fink. If you build R from sources, 
then the configure script should find it. Then subsequent 
installations of packages should find it.

If you installed the R that Jan built, then my guess would be that 
something fell through the cracks, and however Jan incorporated 
readline into his build, some packages aren't finding it. If this is 
the case, you can probably work around it by installing readline, and 
then adjusting some environment variable (LD_LIBRARY_PATH ?) to 
include /sw/lib before attempting the package installation.

On the other hand, it could be trickier than that. To explore a bit, try this:

test[37]% which R
/usr/local/bin/R

test[38]% grep LD /usr/local/bin/R
: 
${R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${R_HOME}/bin:/sw/lib:/usr/local/lib:/sw/lib:/usr/local/lib:/sw/lib:/usr/local/lib:/sw/lib/gcc-lib/powerpc-apple-darwin6.2/3.1:/sw/lib/gcc-lib/powerpc-apple-darwin6.2/3.1/../../..:/usr/X11R6/lib:/sw/lib:/sw/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib}
if test -z "${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"; then
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="${R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="${R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Note that /sw/lib is present in R's load library path.

you ?
