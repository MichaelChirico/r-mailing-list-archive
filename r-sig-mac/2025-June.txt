Thanks for the feedback, Marc! Very interesting.

It seems we (emacs/ess users) are a diminishing crowd :-(

I had already planned to upgrade to macos-15.5. I?m not able to
upgrade (fully) to R-4.5 in the immediate future ? worse, I need
to have multiple R versions on-hand for some backwards-compatibility
testing (work apps/apis).

I do subscribe occasionally to the ?three-finger salute? way of
fixing some OS or program issues, but I really dislike the fact that
it works much more frequently than I think it should.

|ggplot2| does tend to be more complex and test the graphics device
more than typical base graphics; I recall an issue with ggplot on
windows several years ago that caused the window to dump,
occasionally causing R to dump and crash as well, triggered by a
mouse-wheel action on a ggplot graphics pane. This is not the same
issue, certainly, but speaks to the difference with base graphics.

For the record, while I use it much much less frequently, I have yet
to see the issue appear when a base-graphics plot is displayed. This
is not conclusive.

The only mentions I can find of XQuartz on the R-Mac pages are:

  * Big Sur and newer require XQuartz 2.8.5 (I?m good, installed 2.8.5
    from the start)
  * ?Always re-install XQuartz when upgrading your macOS to a new
    major version?: not applicable, I?ve been on 15.3 or newer on this
    laptop (unless ? is 15.4 a ?major version? over 15.3?)

Regardless of that, I don?t understand how an xorg-server would be
at all tied to (needing to be reinstalled/relinked after) changes in
a client library (R plotting services). Can you provide more
information (a link) where they say XQuartz needs to be reinstalled
with each R upgrade? I apologize if I?m missing it on mac.r-project.org.

> See if re-installing XQuartz has any impact on the issues that you are observing.

Regardless of ?why? it may work, I think I?m going to uninstall and
reinstall XQuartz when I do the macos upgrade. ?It can?t hurt?,
famous last words.

Sage advice, I appreciate it.

That?s been on my list, but since I still don?t know exactly what
causes it to hang, I have not spent the time trying to repeat it
from outside of my normal R use.

Once thing I find interesting is that it is particular to one R
process, but not to XQuartz. That is, when one R process? graphics
device is hung, I can open a new R process and plotting works
without issue. I can close the first process, eventually its hung
window closes, and other processes continue to plot without issue. I
don?t know if this narrows it down at all, since a bug in either R
or XQuartz could show that specificity. (The major pain is that
often I?m working with many GBs of data, and reloading and
reprocessing is a not-free chore. Usually not impossible, just many
many minutes and reacquiring my mental focus.)

Thanks again for your experience, Marc!

I'm puzzled why you need XQuartz in the first place. R in a terminal usually fires up the quartz() graphics device and that has nothing to do with XQuartz (which is X on top of Quartz, not the other way around).

We do have an annoyance with XQuartz though: When install.packages() goes looking for a CRAN mirror (*), it fires up a Tk selector and that will require XQuartz to fire up. Every now and again that hangs for me too, but as it is usually the first thing I do in an R session, I can ctr-Z and kill the process and start over. But it really could do with a looking into. (I do miss strace/truss from days of yore, where you could just probe into a running process and see what it is up to.)

-pd

(*) Yeah, I know, it should be in a configuration  file ... somewhere.

Thank you, Peter. I think that?s a misunderstanding of mine based on 
mis-reading mac.r-project.org and incomplete research. I have since 
uninstalled XQuartz and indeed |quartz()| still works, so my bug-report 
has been a misdirection. With this, I?ve changed the here from ?xquartz 
hanging? to ?quartz hanging?.

I?m still working on a reprex, haven?t found the culprit yet. (I haven?t 
had a repeat since I uninstalled and reinstalled then uninstalled XQuartz.)

Thank you again,
Bill

I have been using quartz from inside Emacs for a long time and I basically
never (or at least very rarely) have any issues. I rarely use XQuartz and
never with R installed on my local machine (mostly to start X windows from
a remote server). There is a way to configure the default device in R, so I
would try to start the quartz device manually with
  R> quartz()
  R> plot(1:10)
and check that is the same as
  R> plot(1:10)
to rule out any configuration issues and make sure we're talking about the
same device.

Are you compiling R from source or are you using the CRAN binaries? That
might have an impact.

Best,
Kasper

R 4.5.0's addition of two new routines to BLAS 
(https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html) the 
sym-linking to veclib will not work as Apple doesn't provide the new 
routines.
