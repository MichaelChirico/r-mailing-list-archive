Use a recent version of R, 2.0.1 is over a year (closer to two years)  
out of date. Lots of other things are nicer as well and AFAIK still  
Panther compatible.

Message-ID: <F9E14FBC-B769-4114-9D90-32B31CECFCFA@stat.ucla.edu>

I managed to build a native binary (Mach-O executable i386) for the  
MacIntel machine
on a MacIntel machine, using the bundled gcc and the (beta) Intel  
fortran compiler. This
is a framework build with aqua support -- the quartz device works  
fine, so does the X11
and tcl/tk interaction. I have to do most of the links manually  
because configure/make
does not find the correct Intel dylibs.

I have NOT been able to compile a native gfortran from the apple cvs  
(low priority for apple)
and i have NOT been able to build R using the intel C and fortran  
compilers (mostly
configure problems).

I was struggling with gfortran on the IntelMac for a while, too. The  
only (and I tried many, including backporting stuff, trust me)  
configuration using gcc that (sort of) works is FSF build from the  
4.0.x branch.

Jan, can we compare some benchmarks? I suppose the Intel compiler  
should be much faster ... (and no, I still don't have a good  
benchmark example - we can use yours).

I'm working on R 2.2.1 release builds for ppc64 and i386 right now  
(batteries included ;)), so stay tuned. [Yes, ppc release will be out  
very soon, too - just the GUI localizations are a tad behind schedule  
- my apologies - you can get the framework from the nightlies page  
for now].

Cheers,
Simon

Its all good, I'm using your 2.3 nightly builds since it appears  
someone did something to useDynLib. I'm sort of hoping I can use it  
to resolve symbols more easily.... I need to try libffi again to see  
if I can get the objc/ffi stuff working on x86, the Darwin/x86 code  
wasn't working last time I checked.

Here are some apples and oranges. This is the MacIntel machine
with a single 3.6 Ghz CPU vs the G5 which has 4 x 2.5 Ghz CPU's.
The MacIntel machine uses gcc 4.0.1  and Intel's ifort, the
G5 uses gcc and gfortran 4.0.1. As soon as you have a fat or
a i386 build, we can compare compilers. So far, the MacIntel
looks good -- it will look even better with dual core
Intel chips and with icpc instead of gcc. I'll try to build
something just using the Intel compilers, but I run into trouble
building dylibs and bundles.

There was a recent thread on Mac text editors. I don't remember
seeing smultron (smultron.sourceforge.net) -- which is pure
cocoa, is thus very macosx, has rectangular selection, has line numbers,
projects, a toolbar, a drawer for snippets, show invisibles, html
preview, html help, dotmac synchronization, parantheses matching,  
regular expression
and multi-document search. It can serve as an external editor for FTP  
and
TeX programs and has a command-line version. It's freeware and an active
sourceforge project. If you don't like X11 and Swing and are starting to
dislike the usual Carbon look more and more, this is a good choice.

It has syntax coloring for about 25 languages (not for R/S), but syntax
coloring is easy to add as a plist to the application bundle.

Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to compile the latest devel version from the source.

I'm using gcc 3.3 and g77 (based on gcc 3.4.3). But when I run ./configure I 
get the following error:

configure: error: linking to Fortran libraries from C fails

Do you guys have any suggestion on how I should proceed?

thanks,
b.

btw, these are the last lines of my config.log:

#define STDC_HEADERS 1
#define TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME 1
#define Unix 1
#define VERSION "2.3.0"
#define WORDS_BIGENDIAN 1
#endif
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" void std::exit (int) throw (); using std::exit;

configure: exit 1

hmmm...

it looks like

export FLIBS='-L/sw/lib/ -lg2c'

before ./configure fixed my problem...

if you guys have a better approach, please let me know. it seems it has 
something to do with fink.

cheers,

Yes, there is a better approach. Do not use fink and
get your g77 from Stefano/Simon. Adding the /sw and /opt
hierarchies easily leads to trouble.

FWIW, I am using Fink and building R from source.  I *did* install g77
from the R binary install and not from Fink.

I agree that you need to be careful with Fink.

Thanks Jan. The syntax coloring you forwarded works fine in Smultron.
Does Smultron support rectangular selections?

Last year I used Smultron quite a bit to test with external editors  
in R.app
and indeed found it a really nice editor.  And it also worked fine with
AppleScript (to submit a selection or the entire source file to R).  The
sourceforge version has added several neat features!

At some point I integrated the Smultron source into R.app to see how
difficult that would be. A simple test turned out fairly easy, but  
dropped
that idea in favor of the current setup in R.app (everybody can pick  
his/her
own favorite editor and open/quit of R and editor are decoupled).

Tried to make Smultron multiple window (like the R.app internal  
editor and
SubEthaEdit, a request which at that time had been turned down by
Peter). Would indeed require a lot of work (if at all possible). The
only other minor feature I find surprising is the difference between
Command-Q and clicking the window close button.

After your emails I downloaded the latest version and Smultron  
definitely
is a nice editor and the project feature works well/is useful.

Updated syntax coloring some more. I also colored my strings
blue.

www.cuddyvalley.org/smultron.zip

Rectangular selections work for me (as in BBEdit
or Alpha) using option-click-draw.

As for the AppleScript, I would be nice to have an
R service in R.app so that R code can be evaluated from any
Cocoa application.

on darwin it makes sense to set, once and for all,

sudo ln -s /usr/include/limits.h /usr/local/include/values.h

saves you the trouble of mucking with the source of various libs

If you're going to go through the trouble to simulate a
SysV-specific header on a BSD-derived OS, why not fake
the rest of it?

There was a recent thread on Mac text editors. I don't remember
seeing smultron (smultron.sourceforge.net) -- which is pure
cocoa, is thus very macosx, has rectangular selection, has line numbers,
projects, a toolbar, a drawer for snippets, show invisibles, html
preview, html help, dotmac synchronization, parantheses matching,  
regular expression
and multi-document search. It can serve as an external editor for FTP  
and
TeX programs and has a command-line version. It's freeware and an active
sourceforge project. If you don't like X11 and Swing and are starting to
dislike the usual Carbon look more and more, this is a good choice.

It has syntax coloring for about 25 languages (not for R/S), but syntax
coloring is easy to add as a plist to the application bundle.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] [MacOS] C++ compilation on macos
Message-ID: <BFE7E198.34AD%sdavis2@mail.nih.gov>

I am trying to compile a single c++ file into a shared library using R CMD
SHLIB.  I am able to compile a simple executable using the same code.
However, I get the following output when compiling using R CMD SHLIB.  I am
hoping that some of the Mac gurus can give me a hint about what might be
going on.  I can find plenty of folks having similar problems in other
contexts, but no solutions.  I am using MacOS 10.4.3, g33/g++ 3.3, and R
2.2.0.  

Thanks,
Sean

AFAIR OS X does not provide Excel-ODBC drivers (Excel is not part of  
the OS) and Microsoft doesn't, either. However, Actual Technologies do:
http://www.actualtechnologies.com
I used only their database ODBC drivers, so I don't know about the  
Office one, but it's supposed to work well.

Sean,

you seem to have conflicting compilers in your system. You have some  
compiler (g77? gfortran?) in /usr/local that conflicts with system  
compilers. You should remove the offending compiler, otherwise you  
won't be able to compile any packages at all. More precisely you  
cannot use dynamic /usr/local/lib/libgcc* as it conflicts with  
system's libgcc.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks, Simon.  That was the issue.  I removed g77, gcc, and g++ from
/usr/local/bin and libgcc* from /usr/local/lib and the compilation went
smoothly.

Hi,

Does anybody know how to copy / paste data from Excel to R?

If I type the following:

> read.table(file("clipboard"))

or 

> read.delim(file("clipboard"))

I get an error message:

> Error in open.connection(file, "r") : X11 module cannot be loaded

Thanks,

Sylvain.

Wrong connection, you should use pipe("pbpaste") - see ?pipe - so in  
your example it could look like this:

read.table(pipe("pbpaste"),sep="\t")

Sylvain/Simon -

Is it worth pointing out that read.csv("path/to/file.csv") will read  
the excel data in directly (as a saved as a csv file that is),  
without resorting to the clipboard and copy/paste mode?

Well I would think that such work-around is obvious and unless you  
happen to already have such a file it's more clumsy. (Personally, I  
avoid the use of csv because Excel loves to screw it up depending on  
your locale settings).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app incorrectly choosing localisation
Message-ID: <4f19b6396dc79760a4723ff36cdbec07@utoronto.ca>

In R.app, but not in the console, in 2.2.1 and in 2.2.0 (and perhaps 
earlier), all messages are in Japanese, though menus are still in 
English.

R.app appears to be choosing its language based on the "format" setting 
rather than the "language" setting (in System Preferences > 
International), which would be more appropriate.  I choose dates in 
Japanese in the menu bar for their compactness, but do not read enough 
Japanese to be able to read all R messages in Japanese.  Changing the 
date format setting to "Canada" solves the problem without 
re-installation, but this should not be necessary.  If there is a 
reason R.app does not use the "language" setting, perhaps the language 
for messages could be a choice in R.app preferences.

After starting the R application, it immediately quits "unexpectedly",

Yes, your OS is outdated. You need Mac OS X 10.3.9 in order to run  
the CRAN binary. Please update your system using the software update.

Your OS is outdated, you need 10.3.9, so please update your system.

Another option, that I personally prefer, is read.xls(), from a 
package whose name I don't have available at the moment. Might be 
'foreign'.

I have used it only when the data in the spreadsheet starts in the 
upper left-hand cell (A1), but in that case it works very well.

Thanks. This is in the 'gdata' package. But copy paste is good when you just
want a subset your big files.

Actually, this IS a bug in R.app, since if 10.3.9 is now
required, that value should have been put in the Info.plist.
The user would then be informed of the OS requirement rather
than deal with the application crashing.

Info.plist:
        <key>LSMinimumSystemVersion</key>
-        <string>10.3.0</string>
+        <string>10.3.9</string>

It's not strictly a bug in R.app, because R.app doesn't require  
10.3.9, but the CRAN binary of R does. You can still safely compile  
your own R and use it with the existing R.app. Moreover the  
LSMinimumSystemVersion entry is rather a safeguard than a  
requirement, really. I agree that it would make sense to add a check  
in the CRAN binary installer, but the problem with that is that there  
is no simple way to tell the user what requirement is not met (that  
became possible only in 10.4 so it doesn't help, either) - it will  
simply not allow you to select any volume.

Incidentally, the incompatibility is not really intended directly, it  
comes from the fact that the CRAN binary is compiled on a 10.3.9  
system whose libraries are apparently not compatible with earlier  
versions (and this was the case even with earlier releases of R, so  
it didn't change *now* - it was only noticed recently). Still, I  
don't see a compelling reason not to update one's system, since R  
binary not running is the least drawback there. However, based on  
these requests I will update the documentation correspondingly. (It  
still startles me that exactly the same question with exactly the  
same subject and exactly the same cause is asked twice on the same  
list within 24h although answered promptly.)

Cheers,
Simon

I didn't test MySQL, but AFAIR this problem is caused by compiler  
mismatch (it started with Xcode 2.2 I believe). Did you run sudo  
gcc_select 3.3 before compiling? The real reason for the above is  
that you're missing -lSystemStubs (which is static) when compiling  
RMySQL. Adding that to the LIBS for the package should work.

Cheers,
Simon

I can confirm now that I was using gcc 3.3, but there were some  
warnings. Here is the build log:

Thanks for the reply. I've got the synlink referred to in the doc:

barbaloot:~/src/R-2.2.1 kwythers$ ls -l /usr/lib/libcc_dynamic.a  
lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel  27 Sep 19 13:03 /usr/lib/libcc_dynamic.a@  
-> gcc/darwin/default/libgcc.a

  but I'm confused concerning the "add the ld flag" bit. Does that  
mean just use

./confugure  -with--LDFLAGGS?

The better solution is to get your gcc and gfortran in sync. See

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Current recommendations for compilers on OS X 10.4
Message-ID: <m24q46ftte.fsf@fhcrc.org>

Can someone confirm the recommended compiler and fortran to use for
building R-devel from source on 10.4.x?

I have been  using gcc 3.3 and it has been working fine.  Last I
checked (months ago) gfortran wasn't ready for prime time and the
recommendation was to do gcc_select 3.3.  Is that still the case?  

The wiki [1] seems to indicate that gcc 4.0 is what I should be
using.  Comments?

Thanks,

Well, the Wiki says "Using gcc4 is currently discouraged unless  
necessary, because gfortran is not stable enough (yet). However, you  
are free to give it a shot (useful for 64-bit R - see below, or G5- 
optimized R - see OptimizingR)." so I would say it indicates the  
opposite ;).

The situation got worse, in fact, because recent Apple build versions  
of gfortran don't compile at all. However, you can still use older  
versions of gfortran which (sort of) work.

Incidentally, we have been chasing some nasty compiler bugs in gcc4  
just last week, and the global consensus concerning gcc in general is  
still to avoid gcc4 on production systems (unless necessary, e.g. you  
can't get around gcc4 for 64-bit ppc version of R). Yesterday's Xcode  
update still contains 4.0.1, so I suspect that Apple is currently  
more focused on getting the Intel machines going...

Cheers,
Simon

My apologies.  I hadn't had enough coffee yet and I encountered this page:
http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigerGCC via google and I
interpreted the gcc4 howto as a recommendation. 

Once I (had some coffee and) clicked on the little house icon to get
to the main R+Tiger page (http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigeR)
things are much more clear.

I will stick with gcc3 + g77 for now.

Thanks,

I'm sorry that I probably didn't make myself clear - as I was trying  
to say the problem is (and your build log confirms it) that you have  
Xcode 2.2 and you didn't add -lSystemStubs. You need to do so,  
because R was configured with a different compiler. I just checked  
and the following worked for me with the latest MySQL (5.0.18) and  
latest Xcode (2.2.1):

PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/mysql/include PKG_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mysql/ 
lib -lmysqlclient -lSystemStubs' R CMD INSTALL RMySQL

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building R to use quartz devices from the command line
Message-ID: <556AC5AC-3322-4584-B4D4-4E11F9BEAED4@mail.utexas.edu>

With some very kind help from Jan, I have built R such that it can  
utilize quartz devices from the command line on my iMac G5 (running  
OS 10.4.4).  My understanding is that I cannot use the R.app anymore,  
but that's a trade-off I can live with for now.

My problem is that I cannot seem to get the same thing to work on my  
iBook G3 (also running 10.4.4).  Building and installing seems to  
work just fine, but upon running the program and using the  
install.packages() command, the Aqua tcltk device opens and runs long  
enough for me to choose a CRAN mirror, but then crashes soon  
afterwards (crashing R as well), and returning the message  
"Segmentation fault".  I haven't had a chance to mess around with  
this build too much, but everything else I've tried seems to work  
fine.  I can even open and use a quartz device, which is (so far as I  
can tell) completely interactive.

Here's the configure command I used:

./configure
	\ --with-blas='-framework vecLib'
	\ --with-lapack
	\ --with-tcl-config=/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/ 
tclConfig.sh
	\ --with-tk-config=/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh

Any ideas what I might have done wrong?  Also, I realize I might need  
to reproduce the crash in debug mode in order to isolate the problem,  
but how is this done?  Also, should I post the crash log?

Thanks

Matt

If I remember well, rgl on OS X now uses Aqua OpenGL. If you want to  
run it under xterm you need either to build rgl yourself forcing to  
use X11 OpenGL or rebuild R using Jan's approach. The same applies to  
TclTk.

I had it working at one point, but that was quite a while ago now.

You are starting it from an R that knows about X11 and an appropriate 
tcl/tk (for X11), no?

Folks - please forgive a rather uninformed post from a poor soul who
bailed out on the mac os several years ago...  I am considering the
purchase of a new MacBook Pro; however, I rely heavily on R for my
teaching and research.  I am assuming that the current binary of v.
2.2.1 will work through the Rosetta engine, but - anyone have a guess as
to how long it will be before a native binary is available (I am no
prorgammer, and it would take me months to try to figure out how to
compile, especially in uncharted warters)?  Anyone know of any problems
I should be aware of?  

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Both Simon and I have working versions of a native R -- Simon may
also have a fat binary. We use both gcc/gfortran and the beta
versions of the Intel compilers. Things are not smooth yet because
the Intel compilers are pretty beta and don't know about bundles,
while gfortran must be gobbled together from various bits and pieces.

Just curious, but what will it take to get R on macintel stable?  What are
the limiting factors and when will those limiting factors disappear,
particularly since the new laptops are SUPPOSED to ship next month?  Just
curiosity....

Well, the iMac's are already shipping. We are waiting for
several things: improvements in the Intel compiler
sequence (it compiles all of R, but there are linking and
runtime problems) and for Apple to update gfortran in
its CVS and make it compile on Mactel (although it is
optimistic to hope this will happen any time soon). My
guess is there a usable R in a month.

There is an unofficial, experimental R 2.2.1 release for MacIntels  
available already (see the CRAN OS X page at the bottom - Jan kindly  
posted the direct link). The R.app GUI is in fact shipped as  
universal binary since 2.2.1.

The reason for the Intel build being experimental is that it doesn't  
pass make check. The compilers (both Apple gcc and Intel) still seem  
to have bugs that cause them to miscompile code.

However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel - just now I was  
able to compile R for MacIntel that is much closer to passing make  
check ("only" one part of one check failed), so I expect to have more  
serious binary sometime next week.

Cheers,
Simon

For those who also want to dabble in this:

Intel ifort and Intel icc do compile R, but cannot link
bundles. You can hack around this by using the bundled gcc
compiler driver for linking, but then you also
have to tell it where the Intel libraries are. You could
probably also get around this by using configure flags and/or
environmental variables. And possibly by using the -X flag
to pass icc arguments directly to the static linker ld. But
none of this is nice.

GNU gcc and gfortran from CVS have the same problem,
basically. They don't know about --bundle, so linking
of packages with shared libraries fails. But at least
you can build both gcc and gfortran on MacIntel from
here.

Apple gcc and gfortran from CVS have more problems,
because you cannot build a native gfortran from
the current Apple CVS. You cannot build it using the
bundled gcc, and not with the Intel compilers
either.

So what's left: use the bundled gcc from apple to
build gfortran from GNU-CVS. These two together build and link
R just fine -- it just doesn't pass make check yet.

GNU gcc (at least for ppc) does know about -bundle.  It just can't be  
the first argument - this is a long standing parser bug.  Here is a  
configure patch that fixes the problem on ppc, it also removes -no- 
cpp-precomp.  Anyone want to try it on x86 OSX?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problem including jpeg & png support for R-2.2.1 under
	OS-X on G5s
Message-ID: <0D754B66-65E6-4FF6-812E-433E0F9E6AD4@biostat.ucsf.edu>

For some reason, my builds of R (OS X 10.4.4, gcc 3.3) on our G5  
machines
aren't picking up these libraries (as evidenced by the output of the
capabilities() command), even though they exist and check out
as OK in config.log.

However, the G4 builds include both. The only difference I see  in  
the configurations
are the use of G5-specific optimization flags on the G5s:
     CFLAGS='-mcpu=970 -mtune=970 -mpowerpc64 -mpowerpc-gpopt'


Any suggestions appreciated.

Ah, it just hit me - do you have X11 running at all? Bitmap support  
requires you to have X11 server running, because that's the way R  
creates bitmaps. The output of "capabilities" is dynamic, i.e. if  
your DISPLAY is not set or there is no X11 running, R will disable  
both X11 and bitmap support.

All,
   The problem seems to be that tcltk just won't load, nor can it be  
installed from CRAN.  Any ideas?  Even clean installs of R (on  
machines never having had R installed) reproduce this problem.  Is it  
just broken for the latest release, or what?

John,

Are you using R.app? Did you customize & selected Tcl/Tk when you  
installed R
(during the 4th or 5th step)?

Please respond directly to me.

Regards,
Rob

Solution see below - but I'd be interested in your exact setup.  
Please send me the version information of all compilers involved.

This comes from a work-around for the incompatible ABI of gfortran.  
For some strange reason (I'd like to know why) your gfortran seems to  
append two underscores.

The 'hot-fix' for your particular setup is to edit src/modules/lapack/ 
vecLibg95c.c and replace everything between #ifdef and #endif at the  
beginning of the file by one simple
# define F77_SYMBOL(x)   x ## __

In the meantime I'll see if I can get a better fix committed.

Thanks,
Simon

Dear list members,

I was suggested to contact this list for information concerning the kinship 
package that I ported a while ago. It is said that the package won't compile 
properly but I have no means to check for it, although it appears there is 
no problem with the checking from CRAN. However, that was for a version I 
posted almost a year ago. It works with no problem on Sun Solaris, Red Het 
Linux and Windows that I usually use.

Any indication and suggestions for fixing the problems, if any, would be 
greatly appreciated. I can also be contacted via my e-mail account from work 
jinghua.zhao at mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk.

Many thanks in advance,

Simon,

Your hot-fix worked perfectly.  I'm not sure exactly what you want  
about compilers,
is this sufficient?

yzzy: gcc --version
powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.0 (GCC) 4.0.0 (Apple Computer, Inc.  
build 5018)

yzzy: gfortran --version
GNU Fortran 95 (GCC 4.0.0 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5018))

Thanks very much for your help,

Roger

The usual problem: to link bundles (plug-ins) OS X uses flat  
namespaces, and by
default you cannot have multiple symbol definitions if you use flat  
namespaces,
because the dynamic linker would have no way of knowing which  
definition to
use at run time.

The proper way to fix this is to define your symbols only once and  
declare
them extern in the other files.

Those of you who want to use the package without waiting for the fix  
can use
R CMD INSTALL in the terminal, which will break at the same place.  
Then copy the link statement
to the clipboard, go to the src directory, and paste

/usr/local/bin/gcc -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress - 
Xlinker -m -L/usr/local/lib -o kinship.so agfit6b.o  
bdsmatrix_index1.o bdsmatrix_index2.o bdsmatrix_index3.o

coxfit6b.o coxfit6c.o gchol.o gchol_bds.o   -F/Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/.. -framework R

INserting -Xlinker -m  forces the link. Apple frowns on this, for  
obvious reasons. Then run R CMD INSTALL again.

Yes, that is a known issue with the X11 tcltk package if you try to  
save tcltk objects in the image. Basically what happens is that when  
you save a workspace containing tcltk objects, R will automatically  
load tcltk on the next start while restoring the image. This very  
often breaks things (including R crash), because R may have been  
started in a different way before (cmd line/X11/R.app...). The short  
answer is don't save tcltk objects.

The hot-fix for the Rcmdr is to run
rm(.commander.done)
before you quit R and save the image. I have no idea why this  
variable is stored in the global environment instead of a private one  
in Rcmdr, but you'll have to ask John about this.

Simon

Hi!

I tried to build R 2.2.1 from source on Mac OS 10.4.3 Tiger, Darwin 8.3.0

I was proceeding like this:

./configure F77=g77 CC="/usr/bin/gcc-3.3"
make

You will need to run
sudo gcc_select 3.3
before configuring R (and you don't need to set F77/CC if you don't  
want to). If that doesn't help, please let me know.

Thanks a lot for your help, this worked fine!

Unfortunately I am running into another problem: I can not load RMySQL
after installing it from source. What I do is the following:


sudo gcc_select 3.3
export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/mysql/include"
export PKG_LIBS="-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient"

sudo R CMD INSTALL RMySQL_0.5-5.tar.gz 

This seems to work, but when I try to load RMySQL in R i get the
following error message:

> library(RMySQL)
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) : 
        unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/RMySQL/libs/RMySQL.so':

  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/RMySQL/libs/RMySQL.so
  Expected in: flat namespace
Error in library(RMySQL) : .First.lib failed for 'RMySQL'

Any idea how I could solve this?

Thanks, Kjell. I have committed similar changes to R-devel and it now  
compiles on Intel Macs pretty much out of the box with the GNU build  
of gcc4. The Intel compilers are almost there, save for a few bugs  
that have been reported. As of performance, don't hold your breath,  
Core Duo is fast for daily use, but not particularly good at  
computing like BLAS.

Is this something that is likely to change?  Will new chips going into
high-end desktops have the same issue?

I have no idea and I would hope not. I'm pretty curious as of what  
Apple wants to use to replace the current quad-G5 line which is  
really fast. For now, AMD64 X2 is still the clear winner compared to  
everyone else, but who knows what the landscape will look like by the  
end of 2006 ... (and Steve has always an ace up his sleeve ;)).

Has anyone tried linking R against an accelerated BLAS like Atlas or
K. Goto's BLAS?  I know that Goto's BLAS for the Opteron are
multithreaded and can use a dual core processor effectively.  I
presume the same is true for dual core Intel processors.

Yes, I was using ptATLAS (which compiles fine on OS X) and it uses  
both cores resulting in a bit less than half the time compared to  
vecLib which doesn't use threads.

Message-ID: <BFFD3997.5B04%s.charlat@ucl.ac.uk>

Hi,

Is there any simple way to get histogram for different levels of factor?

Say you have the following data set:
  
 Island Sp.diam  
 Moorea 1.21  
 Moorea 1.27  
 Moorea 1.28  
 Moorea 1.22  
 Moorea 1.28  
 Rurutu 1.5  
 Rurutu 1.67  
 Rurutu 1.75  
 Rurutu 1.55  
 Rurutu 1.7  
 Rurutu 1.55  
 Rurutu 1.59  
 Rurutu 1.66  
 Rurutu 1.7

Is there anything better than:

> hist(Sp.diam[factor(Island)=="Moorea"],main="Island=Moorea")

followed by

> hist(Sp.diam[factor(Island)=="Rurutu"],main="Island=Rurutu")

Sorry for this very stupid and basic question...

Thanks for any help,

Sylvain.

Hi,
you should change the settings in XCode so that R(.framework) headers  
can be found in proper places.
Probably you should first drop away the R headers from the R.app  
project and add them again by drag and drop from your ~/Library

According to Apple, the Intel iMacs have specFP performance twice  
that of the G5 iMacs they replace. Definitely slower than the quad  
powermacs but will make most most people happy.

That is true, you need to add ~/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Headers to the include path (-I) in the compiler options. R headers  
directory structure is not compatible with the way frameworks are  
included so we still need the to set the header path explicitly.

SPECs are one thing, reality another, we have learned that many times  
over. I guess it is public information now that those Macs are now  
available at every Apple store where you can test this for yourself,  
but BLAS is actually slower on Core Duo than on a single G5 of the  
same clock speed (and this includes using both cores of the Intel  
with ptATLAS so you can test it on any computer with Darwin). This is  
in fact consistent with the P4 BLAS performance in general (no one I  
know considers P4 seriously for computing - if x86 then AMD). Some  
other (non-BLAS) tests show faster speed than G5 possibly due to the  
large caches and the Intel chip blows away G5 in tasks like sorting  
of large vectors.

Apart from R performance the machines feel fast - the dual core is  
definitely a win if you can keep it busy (compilation, threaded tasks  
etc.). My next laptop will be a MacBook, but I'll keep my iMac G5 for  
a while ;).

Simon

The gfortran referenced on the TigerGCC wiki page is
4.0.0(5202) for Xcode 2.1. I loaded this on my system
before remembering I'm running Xcode 2.2.1. My gcc
version is 4.0.1(5250) which is newer than the full
replacement tarball 4.0.1(5224) as well.

Are these compatible or is there a later (working) gfortran
that goes with the build on my iMacG5?

The problem is that the answer to the latter is "no". Apple's branch  
has broken gfortran a while ago. So right now there are basically two  
alternatives - use old Apple-branch gfortran or use the FSF build (I  
tried to port FSF changes to Apple's build but failed - anyone who  
succeeded, please let me know).

For the latest optimized R (ppc64) I am currently using complete FSF  
build of gcc off the 4.0.x branch and it works fine. In fact the  
upcoming R 2.2.1 release for Intel Macs (due sometime next week) is  
also built using those tools.

As for the 5224 and Xode 2.2, I don't know about the compatibility,  
because I have only one box with Xcode 2.2 due to all the issues it  
was causing and that one is already heavily infested with various  
builds of gfortran so frankly I can't tell. With the 5224 you'll also  
lose the ability to compile i386 code, because those are not "fat"  
compilers (but AFAIK three is no gfortran that would support fat  
builds anyway). I can package my latest FSF gcc build for anyone  
interested... I have it in a separate directory so it doesn't  
conflict with the 'regular' tools.

Cheers,
Simon

I continue to hear Apple's branch has broken gfortran, though never
hear specifically what is broken about it. I don't mind filing a
bug report with them too (always heard their Java engineers fixed
what got the most bug reports first). I imagine there are enough
people reading this list to file enough reports to at least get
someone to look at it. Or possibly get someone with expiring
"incidents" to use one on this. Do we have enough information
to say specifically what's wrong with gfortran?

It doesn't compile - that's what's broken :). My impression is that  
there is quite a bunch of new pieces and changes in the C back-end  
code that were shared by the gfortran, but the fortran part was not  
updated correspondingly. I tried to patch some of the holes, but  
didn't get very far. Maybe if someone has the spare time to trace all  
the changes individually in both the FSF and Apple branch could put  
it together...

> I don't mind filing a bug report with them too

The problem is Apple doesn't support gfortran and never did. The  
ability to compile gfortran from the Apple branch was just incidental  
and required some tweaking as well (basically manually enabling f95  
in the build script and patching together fat gfortran libraries),  
but it was harmless. When you ask them, they say "use f2c" (but R  
doesn't support that).

Cheers,
Simon

I guess what I find odd about [gfortran not compiling] is
that no one seems to mention that in the Apple mailing
list over the last couple months.

gfortran compiles find on powerpc systems -- not on mactel
systems. until a few weeks ago, people with mactel systems
were under nondisclosure and could not post the info on
any mailing lists.

Obtaining a newer build of 'gfortran' than 5202 is not out
of the question then. Just wanted the matching F95 compiler
for Xcode 2.2.1 build (PPC).

Many thanks for the hints.
I succed to build R.app by addressing the headers and framework in R  
project, plus changing 3 links in the file Info.plist.
R.app works perfectly but if I delete the Mac-GUI folder it doesn't  
work anymore. Anyone knows how to fix it?
Many thank in advance.
Regards
Roberto

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Foreign and UTF-8 on OS X
Message-ID: <43DE822C.1090509@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

Hi List,

    I brought this issue up in the R-help list a few months ago, and
they recommended that, as the problem looked Mac environment-related to
them, I bring it up here.

    In particular, when I use the foreign package to export a dataframe
to SPSS, the data file looks good, but the command file contains a mix
of ASCII and UTF-8 quotation marks. For example, executing ...

>write.foreign(test.df, "datafile.dat", "codefile.sps", package="SPSS")

yields ...

-----------------------
DATA LIST FILE= !!!datafile.dat!!!  free
/ subjID AR.efkt SR.efkt Efkt AR.corr SR.corr w.tgtPrt w.tgtUrt w.prmRrt
w.prmUrt s.tgtPrt s.tgtUrt s.prmRrt s.prmUrt tgtPrt tgtUrt prmRrt prmUrt  .

VARIABLE LABELS
subjID "subjID" ... ... ...
------------------------

where !!! are UTF-8 left and right quotes. The quotes in "subjID" are
ASCII, and thus cause no problem.

Why am I getting a mix of UTF-8 and ASCII? Is it valid to mix UTF-8 and
ASCII in the same file? ... or is this an error? ... or is something
incorrect in my environment?

I am running Panther 10.3.9 on an iBook G4

Ideas?  Thanks in advance.
