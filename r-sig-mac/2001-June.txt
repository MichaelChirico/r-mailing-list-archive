Dear all,
I discovered a conflict between R and the control panel Adobe Type Manager
(I have ATM Light 4.6.1 on a not new iBook under OS 9.1).
When I start up R, after clicking OK on the
file input dialogue, there is a pause of highly random length before
the R command window appears. Roughly speaking: 0 with probability 1/3, 
exponential with mean 5 seconds with probability 1/3, infinite with 
probability 1/3.

Did anyone else experience this problem or something like it?

I have ATM Light because OzTeX tells you you should. It takes care of
(excellent) screen rendition of postscript fonts. It is available free
from the Adobe web pages (if you look very carefully) for   
Adobe Type Manager DeLuxe.
Yours
Richard Gill

Hello!  Thanks for the first report I've seen of ESS/Emacs on Mac OS.

I didn't know that Emacs on OS 9 handled subprocesses?   This needs to
be checked/verified.

Can you do anything like:
        M-x shell ?

Is there an Rterm.exe on the Mac?

If not, we'd have to figure out if R on Mac OS (>=9.x) uses anything
like COM/OLE to communicate (I'm pretty sure it did/does, but also
sure that it wasn't COM/OLE/DDE); this would be in analogy to the
Emacs Splus 2k direct connection.

I've had the symptoms you describe but hadn't worked out what the 
problem was - I use ATM 4.6.1 on a G4 PowerMac with MacOS 9.1.  I 
gave up using R but I might get motivated to solve the problem now. 
Thanks!

Hi, again!

Oh, I didn't know that there was some other requirement to
use ESS/R. I think you're right. I got

"Multi-processing is not supportrd for this system"

message when i typed "M-x shell". It looks like I;m out of
luck. :( Is there anyone working on this matter?

Thanks again.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]vectorizing calculations
Message-ID: <p05001908b74152d41e84@[128.115.153.6]>

Hi,
 From Apple's scitech mailing list, Veridian Systems is (are) looking 
for beta testers for an OS X vectorizing compiler. Given the 
vectorized nature of R, this seems like it ought to have some 
potential.

-Don

p.s.
Please let me know if copying something like this to r-sig-mac is 
considered inappropriate to r-sig-mac (I doubt that Veridian would 
object...)
[and I expect there might be licensing issues]

For those who don't know about it, see

Subject: AltiVec Fortran vectorizer beta test on OS X
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 13:29:42 -0700

We're looking for beta testers for a new product of ours on OS X,
VAST-F/AltiVec.  If you're interested, please contact me (see below).

Using Absoft's F90 beta version and Apple's [g]cc, we're seeing speedups
for simple operations roughly like this (at vector lengths of 100):

array+array     3.8
array*array     3.8
saxpy           3.5
sqrt(array)     7.1

Real applications won't show this much gain; roughly speaking a factor of
two is a pretty good target for a fairly-well-vectorizable program.  (The
reason for this is that the limiting factor tends to be how much of the
code _doesn't_ get vectorized, not how much faster the vectorized part
is.)   For example, Linpack 100x100 acclerates by 1.8, ARC2D (a well-known
older fluid dynamics benchmark) by 1.6.

Some caveats:  As you probably know, there's no double precision support on
AltiVec.  Because of various overheads in this particular setup, vectorized
code may be slower than scalar at loop counts less than about 8.

A little background:  VAST-F/AltiVec operates by converting vectorizable
loops into calls to VAST-generated C functions containing vector
operations.  This somewhat roundabout procedure is necessitated by
Motorola's having defined source-level vector extensions only for C;
however the compilation details are handled by the driver we supply, so
compiler invocation is identical to what you're used to except for the name
of the compiler.

On OS X we also have an existing analogous product for C, VAST-C/AltiVec,
and are preparing versions of VAST-F/Parallel and VAST-C/Parallel, for
autoparallelization on dual-processor systems.  All these products are also
available on Linux.

More information is available on our web site, and again please contact me
directly if you're interested in the beta test.

while you are waiting to learn about multiple processes, you can still
do the editing in ESS in emacs, and get the syntactic highlighting and
other editing awareness that ESS provides.  You will need to manually
pick up and drop highlighted regions from ESS into the R window.

Message-ID: <p05010400b743543909e3@[193.170.84.51]>

I am not able to restrict axes to a given extension if I want to add text to a plot outside the area of the xlim(or ylim) area.
I tried to use par(usr) or par(xaxp) both seem not to work. (I am fairly new to R and did not use a non-Mac version before - possibly I misunderstand those par or some other function/approach makes this easy).
Does anybody have an idea how to get rid of surplus axes.

I hope this example is easily reproducable (Wanted: to get rid of negative axis in this case):

ws<- c(0,0,5,7,18,31)
labF2<- c("Industrie","Finanzdienst","Transport,Telekom","Tourismus","Gewerbe,andere Dienstleistung" "Handel" )

I have now setup things to compile R using Darwin/X11 in
various ways

1. with or without gnome support
2. with or without tcl/tk support
3. using f2c or g77

I am using X11 libraries from tenon, but I am sure Xfree will
be equally effective. One thing you definitely need is dlcompat.
I now use dylibs rather than static libraries whereever possible.
For this (gnome, tcl/tk, dlcompat, readline, makeinfo, tetex)
I use the excellent system at fink.sourceforge.net. For g77
versions I use the stuff at http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/macosx/10.0.X/,
but this version of gcc/g77 does not work well with configure, so
some tweaking by hand is required.

If you want to try the same thing, or need some of my dylibs, or
want to have a tarball with R-devel (f2c + gnome + tcltk), drop me
a line. I can also send dylibs later, if it turns out you need them.

The main advantage of using Darwin/X11 over Carbon is that
it is generally easier to install packages and to interact with
other parts of the system (CORBA, g-xgobi, perl, python. mysql,
etc). Also, if you use the Xtools server from tenon, the two
implementations more or less look the same (and soon Xaqua/
Xfree will have rootless as well).

Regarding my earlier question: here is the answer. Using the XDarwin
server from XFree86 4.1 makes "R --gui=gnome" work fine on OS X
(using both XFree86 and the gnome stuff from fink). The problem was
the Xtools server I used before.

Regarding my earlier question: here is the answer. Using the XDarwin

server from XFree86 4.1 makes "R --gui=3Dgnome" work fine on OS X

(using both XFree86 and the gnome stuff from fink). The problem was

the Xtools server I used before.

<excerpt>

Over the summer all faculty and student Macintoshes will be upgraded

to MacOS X. To indicate which choices this gives you, let me outline

the possibilities for running R (which will be our official supported
graduate

and faculty computing environment starting next year). Of course most

people do not need all these alternatives, but the nice thing is that
you

have many choices before you settle down in your preferred environment.


It will also please you to hear that I have been running MacOS X in

various versions for over a year now, Jose has been running it for

months, Dick has been running it for a month. It does not crash.
Sometimes

applications crash, but that's a minor event for OS X, they dont take
the=20

whole system with them as in MacOS 9.


We will only look at native versions of R, i.e. versions that run
directly in

OS X, have executables in Mach-O fomat, and do not run in some sort

of emulated environment. This excludes versions of R you could run

in Windows running in the Virtual PC emulation, it also excludes
versions

of R running in the Classic environment, which runs the MacOS 9

operating system. Machines will be configured in such a way that they

automatically start Classic, which means that all applications that are

not native yet (such as Office and Acrobat and SPSS) will run
seemlessly.

On the other hand, we expect that most of these applications will have

been ported to Carbon (see below) by the fall anyway.


Here are the R alternatives.


1. There is a Carbon version of R. It runs under both MacOS 9 and
MacOS X

(which technically means it uses PEF and not Mach-O), but you only get

the benefits of running native (better memory management, symmetric

multiprocessing, protected memory) if you use MacOS X. This is the

way of running R that is  closest to classic Mac. Of course you do get
the

benefits of the Carbon library (the Aqua interface), even under MacOS
9.

In this version R has a command window and you open a graphics

device, which is by default another Mac window. This is the year 2000

version of R. For Mac persons.


2. There is also a 1970 version. You open a terminal window, type R,

the terminal window becomes the command window. You set the device

to postscript or pdf or none, and you do not have to deal with
graphical

interfaces at all. There is no good reason to do this, except perhaps

nostalgia.


3. The 1990 version presupposes that you have installed an X server.

Our Macs will have XDarwin installed (at least as an option). Start R
in

the terminal window and open the x11 device for all your graphics.

This works basically in the same way as the Carbon version, but

it uses executables in Mach-O format, and can be expected to be

more efficient. Because you are in the BSD Unix + X11R6 environment,

it is easier to port R packages. Also, remember that installing XDarwin

gives you access to all X applications (xpdf, xdvi, xemacs, xv, xfig,

and so on). You can download this version  of R from my homepage.

For Mac/Unix persons.


4. There is a 2000 variation on the 1990 version. R comes with a

gtk device, which you can use if you start R with "R --gui=3Dgnome"

in a terminal window. You need a specially compiled R, which again

sits on my homepage, but you also need many parts of the gnome

desktop environment installed. This gives an R for Linux persons.

The command window is a gnome window, and the graphics window

is yet another gnome window. The gnome environment allows you

access to yet another slew of applications (guppi, gimp, ggobi, and so
on)

on top of all of X11. For Mac/Linux persons.


5. The 2010 version of R uses Cocoa and Quartz. These are the natural

and best tools for application development on OS X, programs compiled

in this way are better at multiprocessing and use the native pdf format

for OS X graphics more efficiently. There is no Cocoa version of R

yet (although people are working on a cocoa device for R).


Of course what we have said here for R in principle also applies to
XLISP-STAT,

but because the developer community is much smaller, there are fewer

alternatives (only Classic in emulation mode and X11). Carbon and Cocoa

versions will probably never happen. It also applies to commercial

programs, which are in the process of being carbonized. There are

carbon versions of Eudora, Acroread, Stata, Interarchy, Graphic
Converter,

CMacTeX, Python, gnuplot, BBEdit, AppleWorks, Explorer, Mozilla

to mention a few popular programs. The Cocoa program TeXShop=20

provides a very nice interface to the command-line teTeX programs

running in the background, and uses the native pdf previewer. In

short, there is very little reason to use the Classic mode, and there

will even be less reason by the end of the year.

I would like, in an elementary probability class, to draw by freehand
a curve and import it into R as a function (e.g. as a bezier curve with
knots). Does anyone know a quick and easy way to do this
preferably using some freeware or cheap shareware drawing programme?
The aim is to do it "live", quickly and easily.

It may not be quite what you want but here my bit:
I used dataThief for similar things (translating scanned diagrams into tables).
You could follow a curve in any PICT-graph and catch coordinates pointwise (but not slopes). In R you would need a spline function or something similar.
My version (1.08) is from 1992 (and I have not tried it on my current 9.04).
I could forward it but you want to test it try first to find a more recent version.

Answer to my previous question on negative axis deletion
Plot barplot without axes.
Add restricted axis afterwards.

ws<- c(0,0,5,7,18,31)
labF2<- c("Industrie","Finanzdienst","Transport,Telekom","Tourismus","Gewerbe,andere Dienstleistung","Handel" )
barplot(ws,  main="Wirtschaftssektor, Fachgruppe",horiz=T,names.arg=NULL,xlim=c(-68,40),xaxp=c(0,40,4) ,axes=F )
text(-63,seq(0.6,length=6,by=1.2),labF2,adj=0)
axis(1,c(0,20,40,60))

I am still interested in a way to do it whith the plot/barplot command.

Does anybody have an idea how to plot AND save a series of graphs (not the commands to plot them)  unattended (for a slightly changed data set/data frame)?

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now find

R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 22 MB)

This file has support for X11, tcl/tk, and gnome. It uses many
dynamic libs, which are NOT included. If you need one (because
R cannot find foo.dylib, just ask me, I'll send it, and you put it in 
the appropriate
place). You could also install Xfree/XDarwin, plus dlcompat,
plus all the gnome stuff from fink (fink.sourceforge.net) -- but
that will take some time. This version has been build with f2c,
not with the new f77.

You unzip and untar in /, everything is put in /usr/local (so
you probably must sudo).

The file also contains compiled versions of the following
packages (latest versions):

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now find


R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 22 MB)


This file has support for X11, tcl/tk, and gnome. It uses many

dynamic libs, which are NOT included. If you need one (because

R cannot find foo.dylib, just ask me, I'll send it, and you put it in
the appropriate

place). You could also install Xfree/XDarwin, plus dlcompat,

plus all the gnome stuff from fink (fink.sourceforge.net) -- but

that will take some time. This version has been build with f2c,

not with the new f77.


You unzip and untar in /, everything is put in /usr/local (so

you probably must sudo).


The file also contains compiled versions of the following

packages (latest versions):

Message-ID: <200106240438.VAA57570@pine.frazmtn.com>

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now REALLY find

R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 23 MB)

Uploading it from the mountains over a modem turned out to be a
bit of a problem. Therefor you can now also find the file split in 22 
chunks
in the directory chunks.

You can also find more recent versions of R.bin and the modules
lapack.so and R_gnome.so that have been compiled with the
fast BLAS from ATLAS in the directory atlas. libatlas and libcblas
and libf77blas are statically linked, so no dylibs are necessary to use
these. Just replace the files.

The directory dylibs will eventually hold the necessary dylibs, but I
need to find out on a clean OS X install on another Mac which ones
I actually need.

It might be better to change the order of calls in
macintosh()


macintosh(5,3,12)
should be equivalent to
macintosh(width=5,height=2,pointsize=12)
 at the time it complains about missing string constant

Error in Macintosh(display, width, height, pointsize) :
	invalid string argument

I guess instead of
> macintosh
function (display = "", width = 5, height = 5, pointsize = 12)
.Internal(Macintosh(display, width, height, pointsize))

use better
> macintosh
function (width = 5, height = 5, pointsize = 12, display = "")
.Internal(Macintosh(display, width, height, pointsize))

(or/and change the documentation to include display.)

Hello -

I have used data.dump in SPLUS 2000 on winNT to create a file for 
import in to R-Mac.

The file is 7.7mb.

I have a powerbook 2400c with 80mb ram, and allocate 60 to R when in use.

The file will not restore using data.restore: R quits after 30 sec., 
possibly because it uses all the memory?  Any ideas?  (I have had 
plenty of success with files up to 30k, so its not the coding).

Cheers, (and sorry for the forced disclaimer from the university... 
if its there).

A binary distribution of R-1.3.0 to run on Macintosh PowerPC machines 
with System 8.6 to OS X is available at

		http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos


Stefano M. Iacus
(for the R-core team)

                 Macintosh-specific changes to R


* Fixed a bug when saving from menus
* Added module support
* Fixed a bug that crashes R under System 8.6 due to a calling
   to a non-existent function under 8.6
* Stack and memory settings changed to work on System 8.6
* R main project file and packages project files have been changed
* Added back the "Save" menu
* file.choose() works correctly now
* Now R takes track of file names associated to each window
* Fixed a bug with printer dialog
* Now R can handle "user breaks" in evaluation and printing loops

This may be a novice question...

Using 1.3.0 on 8.6 with 80mb ram, I have just run a session using 
MASS library and lm().  Lots of update() and stepAIC() and 
dropterm().  The model is failry large (selecting the best 3 way 
interaction model from 6 factors and 1 covariate).

At the end of the session, I save the workspace, and quit R.  I 
cannot then restart R (or anything) becasue the memory seems to be 
tied up.  Only 5, 000 were avaible...

Can anyone helop me on this... does R in 8.6 eat and not release 
memory, requireing a finder reboot or a hard reboot?

cheers

Agh, this is a very bad news :(

Can you try this several times ?

or just load the saved workspace and then quit ?

In response to Professor de Leuuw's and Professor Iacus' respective announcements, the MacStats web page "R on the Mac" at
	http://homepage.mac.com/MacStats/R
has been updated with info on R-1.3.0.

This includes links to the relevant info, including the packages Prof. de Leuuw mentions to get gnome working under OS X without buying XTools. As before, the page has links to other info about R and this list.

The page is intended to be a one-stop introduction to R for Mac users who have not used R before. Thus it is probably too basic for any readers of this list, but please suggest it to all your friends. :-) The goal is to make it easy for Mac users to decide whether R is appropriate for their needs, and which port they will want to use.

I would appreciate it if you would let me know if you spot any errors or have any other ideas for changes to this page (or any of the other R or MacStats pages).

Message-ID: <20010603045116.AB64EFBD4@mail.math.uu.nl>

Dear all,
I discovered a conflict between R and the control panel Adobe Type Manager
(I have ATM Light 4.6.1 on a not new iBook under OS 9.1).
When I start up R, after clicking OK on the
file input dialogue, there is a pause of highly random length before
the R command window appears. Roughly speaking: 0 with probability 1/3, 
exponential with mean 5 seconds with probability 1/3, infinite with 
probability 1/3.

Did anyone else experience this problem or something like it?

I have ATM Light because OzTeX tells you you should. It takes care of
(excellent) screen rendition of postscript fonts. It is available free
from the Adobe web pages (if you look very carefully) for   
Adobe Type Manager DeLuxe.
Yours
Richard Gill

Hello!  Thanks for the first report I've seen of ESS/Emacs on Mac OS.

I didn't know that Emacs on OS 9 handled subprocesses?   This needs to
be checked/verified.

Can you do anything like:
        M-x shell ?

Is there an Rterm.exe on the Mac?

If not, we'd have to figure out if R on Mac OS (>=9.x) uses anything
like COM/OLE to communicate (I'm pretty sure it did/does, but also
sure that it wasn't COM/OLE/DDE); this would be in analogy to the
Emacs Splus 2k direct connection.

I've had the symptoms you describe but hadn't worked out what the 
problem was - I use ATM 4.6.1 on a G4 PowerMac with MacOS 9.1.  I 
gave up using R but I might get motivated to solve the problem now. 
Thanks!

Hi, again!

Oh, I didn't know that there was some other requirement to
use ESS/R. I think you're right. I got

"Multi-processing is not supportrd for this system"

message when i typed "M-x shell". It looks like I;m out of
luck. :( Is there anyone working on this matter?

Thanks again.

From a comment made, I think that I need to know if Emacs on Mac OS
(>= 9.x) can send/recieve Apple Events, which R for the Mac may be
able to generate.

Can we find this out?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]vectorizing calculations
Message-ID: <p05001908b74152d41e84@[128.115.153.6]>

Hi,
 From Apple's scitech mailing list, Veridian Systems is (are) looking 
for beta testers for an OS X vectorizing compiler. Given the 
vectorized nature of R, this seems like it ought to have some 
potential.

-Don

p.s.
Please let me know if copying something like this to r-sig-mac is 
considered inappropriate to r-sig-mac (I doubt that Veridian would 
object...)
[and I expect there might be licensing issues]

For those who don't know about it, see
   <http://www.lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/scitech>,

for info about Apple's scitech mailing list.

Subject: AltiVec Fortran vectorizer beta test on OS X
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 13:29:42 -0700

We're looking for beta testers for a new product of ours on OS X,
VAST-F/AltiVec.  If you're interested, please contact me (see below).

Using Absoft's F90 beta version and Apple's [g]cc, we're seeing speedups
for simple operations roughly like this (at vector lengths of 100):

array+array     3.8
array*array     3.8
saxpy           3.5
sqrt(array)     7.1

Real applications won't show this much gain; roughly speaking a factor of
two is a pretty good target for a fairly-well-vectorizable program.  (The
reason for this is that the limiting factor tends to be how much of the
code _doesn't_ get vectorized, not how much faster the vectorized part
is.)   For example, Linpack 100x100 acclerates by 1.8, ARC2D (a well-known
older fluid dynamics benchmark) by 1.6.

Some caveats:  As you probably know, there's no double precision support on
AltiVec.  Because of various overheads in this particular setup, vectorized
code may be slower than scalar at loop counts less than about 8.

A little background:  VAST-F/AltiVec operates by converting vectorizable
loops into calls to VAST-generated C functions containing vector
operations.  This somewhat roundabout procedure is necessitated by
Motorola's having defined source-level vector extensions only for C;
however the compilation details are handled by the driver we supply, so
compiler invocation is identical to what you're used to except for the name
of the compiler.

On OS X we also have an existing analogous product for C, VAST-C/AltiVec,
and are preparing versions of VAST-F/Parallel and VAST-C/Parallel, for
autoparallelization on dual-processor systems.  All these products are also
available on Linux.

More information is available on our web site, and again please contact me
directly if you're interested in the beta test.

while you are waiting to learn about multiple processes, you can still
do the editing in ESS in emacs, and get the syntactic highlighting and
other editing awareness that ESS provides.  You will need to manually
pick up and drop highlighted regions from ESS into the R window.

Message-ID: <p05010400b743543909e3@[193.170.84.51]>

I am not able to restrict axes to a given extension if I want to add text to a plot outside the area of the xlim(or ylim) area.
I tried to use par(usr) or par(xaxp) both seem not to work. (I am fairly new to R and did not use a non-Mac version before - possibly I misunderstand those par or some other function/approach makes this easy).
Does anybody have an idea how to get rid of surplus axes.

I hope this example is easily reproducable (Wanted: to get rid of negative axis in this case):

ws<- c(0,0,5,7,18,31)
labF2<- c("Industrie","Finanzdienst","Transport,Telekom","Tourismus","Gewerbe,andere Dienstleistung" "Handel" )

> ws
F2.3 F2.5 F2.6 F2.2 F2.1 F2.4 
   0    0    5    7   18   31

barplot(ws,  main="Wirtschaftssektor, Fachgruppe",horiz=T,names.arg=NULL,xlim=c(-68,40),xaxp=c(0,40,4)  )
text(-63,seq(0.6,length=6,by=1.2),labF2,adj=0)

wsc<- as.character(ws)
barplot(ws,  main="Wirtschaftssektor, Fachgruppe",horiz=T,names.arg=NULL,xlim=c(-68,40),xaxp=c(0,40,4)  )
text(-63,seq(0.6,length=6,by=1.2),labF2,adj=0)
text(ws-nchar(wsc)-3,seq(0.6,length=6,by=1.2),wsc,adj=0)


(right hand justification needs Hershey fonts which print not so clean numbers inside the bars)

I have now setup things to compile R using Darwin/X11 in
various ways

1. with or without gnome support
2. with or without tcl/tk support
3. using f2c or g77

I am using X11 libraries from tenon, but I am sure Xfree will
be equally effective. One thing you definitely need is dlcompat.
I now use dylibs rather than static libraries whereever possible.
For this (gnome, tcl/tk, dlcompat, readline, makeinfo, tetex)
I use the excellent system at fink.sourceforge.net. For g77
versions I use the stuff at http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/macosx/10.0.X/,
but this version of gcc/g77 does not work well with configure, so
some tweaking by hand is required.

If you want to try the same thing, or need some of my dylibs, or
want to have a tarball with R-devel (f2c + gnome + tcltk), drop me
a line. I can also send dylibs later, if it turns out you need them.

The main advantage of using Darwin/X11 over Carbon is that
it is generally easier to install packages and to interact with
other parts of the system (CORBA, g-xgobi, perl, python. mysql,
etc). Also, if you use the Xtools server from tenon, the two
implementations more or less look the same (and soon Xaqua/
Xfree will have rootless as well).

Regarding my earlier question: here is the answer. Using the XDarwin

(using both XFree86 and the gnome stuff from fink). The problem was
the Xtools server I used before.

<excerpt>

Over the summer all faculty and student Macintoshes will be upgraded

to MacOS X. To indicate which choices this gives you, let me outline

the possibilities for running R (which will be our official supported
graduate

and faculty computing environment starting next year). Of course most

people do not need all these alternatives, but the nice thing is that
you

have many choices before you settle down in your preferred environment.


It will also please you to hear that I have been running MacOS X in

various versions for over a year now, Jose has been running it for

months, Dick has been running it for a month. It does not crash.
Sometimes

applications crash, but that's a minor event for OS X, they dont take
the=20

whole system with them as in MacOS 9.


We will only look at native versions of R, i.e. versions that run
directly in

OS X, have executables in Mach-O fomat, and do not run in some sort

of emulated environment. This excludes versions of R you could run

in Windows running in the Virtual PC emulation, it also excludes
versions

of R running in the Classic environment, which runs the MacOS 9

operating system. Machines will be configured in such a way that they

automatically start Classic, which means that all applications that are

not native yet (such as Office and Acrobat and SPSS) will run
seemlessly.

On the other hand, we expect that most of these applications will have

been ported to Carbon (see below) by the fall anyway.


Here are the R alternatives.


1. There is a Carbon version of R. It runs under both MacOS 9 and
MacOS X

(which technically means it uses PEF and not Mach-O), but you only get

the benefits of running native (better memory management, symmetric

multiprocessing, protected memory) if you use MacOS X. This is the

way of running R that is  closest to classic Mac. Of course you do get
the

benefits of the Carbon library (the Aqua interface), even under MacOS
9.

In this version R has a command window and you open a graphics

device, which is by default another Mac window. This is the year 2000

version of R. For Mac persons.


2. There is also a 1970 version. You open a terminal window, type R,

the terminal window becomes the command window. You set the device

to postscript or pdf or none, and you do not have to deal with
graphical

interfaces at all. There is no good reason to do this, except perhaps

nostalgia.


3. The 1990 version presupposes that you have installed an X server.

Our Macs will have XDarwin installed (at least as an option). Start R
in

the terminal window and open the x11 device for all your graphics.

This works basically in the same way as the Carbon version, but

it uses executables in Mach-O format, and can be expected to be

more efficient. Because you are in the BSD Unix + X11R6 environment,

it is easier to port R packages. Also, remember that installing XDarwin

gives you access to all X applications (xpdf, xdvi, xemacs, xv, xfig,

and so on). You can download this version  of R from my homepage.

For Mac/Unix persons.


4. There is a 2000 variation on the 1990 version. R comes with a

gtk device, which you can use if you start R with "R --gui=3Dgnome"

in a terminal window. You need a specially compiled R, which again

sits on my homepage, but you also need many parts of the gnome

desktop environment installed. This gives an R for Linux persons.

The command window is a gnome window, and the graphics window

is yet another gnome window. The gnome environment allows you

access to yet another slew of applications (guppi, gimp, ggobi, and so
on)

on top of all of X11. For Mac/Linux persons.


5. The 2010 version of R uses Cocoa and Quartz. These are the natural

and best tools for application development on OS X, programs compiled

in this way are better at multiprocessing and use the native pdf format

for OS X graphics more efficiently. There is no Cocoa version of R

yet (although people are working on a cocoa device for R).


Of course what we have said here for R in principle also applies to
XLISP-STAT,

but because the developer community is much smaller, there are fewer

alternatives (only Classic in emulation mode and X11). Carbon and Cocoa

versions will probably never happen. It also applies to commercial

programs, which are in the process of being carbonized. There are

carbon versions of Eudora, Acroread, Stata, Interarchy, Graphic
Converter,

CMacTeX, Python, gnuplot, BBEdit, AppleWorks, Explorer, Mozilla

to mention a few popular programs. The Cocoa program TeXShop=20

provides a very nice interface to the command-line teTeX programs

running in the background, and uses the native pdf previewer. In

short, there is very little reason to use the Classic mode, and there

will even be less reason by the end of the year.

I would like, in an elementary probability class, to draw by freehand
a curve and import it into R as a function (e.g. as a bezier curve with
knots). Does anyone know a quick and easy way to do this
preferably using some freeware or cheap shareware drawing programme?
The aim is to do it "live", quickly and easily.

It may not be quite what you want but here my bit:
I used dataThief for similar things (translating scanned diagrams into tables).
You could follow a curve in any PICT-graph and catch coordinates pointwise (but not slopes). In R you would need a spline function or something similar.
My version (1.08) is from 1992 (and I have not tried it on my current 9.04).
I could forward it but you want to test it try first to find a more recent version.

Answer to my previous question on negative axis deletion
Plot barplot without axes.
Add restricted axis afterwards.

ws<- c(0,0,5,7,18,31)
labF2<- c("Industrie","Finanzdienst","Transport,Telekom","Tourismus","Gewerbe,andere Dienstleistung","Handel" )
barplot(ws,  main="Wirtschaftssektor, Fachgruppe",horiz=T,names.arg=NULL,xlim=c(-68,40),xaxp=c(0,40,4) ,axes=F )
text(-63,seq(0.6,length=6,by=1.2),labF2,adj=0)
axis(1,c(0,20,40,60))

I am still interested in a way to do it whith the plot/barplot command.

Does anybody have an idea how to plot AND save a series of graphs (not the commands to plot them)  unattended (for a slightly changed data set/data frame)?

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now find

R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 22 MB)

This file has support for X11, tcl/tk, and gnome. It uses many
dynamic libs, which are NOT included. If you need one (because
R cannot find foo.dylib, just ask me, I'll send it, and you put it in 
the appropriate
place). You could also install Xfree/XDarwin, plus dlcompat,
plus all the gnome stuff from fink (fink.sourceforge.net) -- but
that will take some time. This version has been build with f2c,
not with the new f77.

You unzip and untar in /, everything is put in /usr/local (so
you probably must sudo).

The file also contains compiled versions of the following
packages (latest versions):

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now find


R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 22 MB)


This file has support for X11, tcl/tk, and gnome. It uses many

dynamic libs, which are NOT included. If you need one (because

R cannot find foo.dylib, just ask me, I'll send it, and you put it in
the appropriate

place). You could also install Xfree/XDarwin, plus dlcompat,

plus all the gnome stuff from fink (fink.sourceforge.net) -- but

that will take some time. This version has been build with f2c,

not with the new f77.


You unzip and untar in /, everything is put in /usr/local (so

you probably must sudo).


The file also contains compiled versions of the following

packages (latest versions):

Message-ID: <200106240438.VAA57570@pine.frazmtn.com>

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now REALLY find

R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 23 MB)

Uploading it from the mountains over a modem turned out to be a
bit of a problem. Therefor you can now also find the file split in 22 
chunks
in the directory chunks.

You can also find more recent versions of R.bin and the modules
lapack.so and R_gnome.so that have been compiled with the
fast BLAS from ATLAS in the directory atlas. libatlas and libcblas
and libf77blas are statically linked, so no dylibs are necessary to use
these. Just replace the files.

The directory dylibs will eventually hold the necessary dylibs, but I
need to find out on a clean OS X install on another Mac which ones
I actually need.

It might be better to change the order of calls in
macintosh()


macintosh(5,3,12)
should be equivalent to
macintosh(width=5,height=2,pointsize=12)
 at the time it complains about missing string constant

Error in Macintosh(display, width, height, pointsize) :
	invalid string argument

I guess instead of
> macintosh
function (display = "", width = 5, height = 5, pointsize = 12)
.Internal(Macintosh(display, width, height, pointsize))

use better
> macintosh
function (width = 5, height = 5, pointsize = 12, display = "")
.Internal(Macintosh(display, width, height, pointsize))

(or/and change the documentation to include display.)

Message-ID: <v04220801b75f87be8e5a@[139.153.139.73]>

Hello -

I have used data.dump in SPLUS 2000 on winNT to create a file for 
import in to R-Mac.

The file is 7.7mb.

I have a powerbook 2400c with 80mb ram, and allocate 60 to R when in use.

The file will not restore using data.restore: R quits after 30 sec., 
possibly because it uses all the memory?  Any ideas?  (I have had 
plenty of success with files up to 30k, so its not the coding).

Cheers, (and sorry for the forced disclaimer from the university... 
if its there).

Message-ID: <200106280925.LAA31830@mailserver.unimi.it>

A binary distribution of R-1.3.0 to run on Macintosh PowerPC machines 
with System 8.6 to OS X is available at

		http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos


Stefano M. Iacus
(for the R-core team)

                 Macintosh-specific changes to R


* Fixed a bug when saving from menus
* Added module support
* Fixed a bug that crashes R under System 8.6 due to a calling
   to a non-existent function under 8.6
* Stack and memory settings changed to work on System 8.6
* R main project file and packages project files have been changed
* Added back the "Save" menu
* file.choose() works correctly now
* Now R takes track of file names associated to each window
* Fixed a bug with printer dialog
* Now R can handle "user breaks" in evaluation and printing loops

Message-ID: <v04220800b760e017b640@[139.153.139.73]>

This may be a novice question...

Using 1.3.0 on 8.6 with 80mb ram, I have just run a session using 
MASS library and lm().  Lots of update() and stepAIC() and 
dropterm().  The model is failry large (selecting the best 3 way 
interaction model from 6 factors and 1 covariate).

At the end of the session, I save the workspace, and quit R.  I 
cannot then restart R (or anything) becasue the memory seems to be 
tied up.  Only 5, 000 were avaible...

Can anyone helop me on this... does R in 8.6 eat and not release 
memory, requireing a finder reboot or a hard reboot?

cheers

Agh, this is a very bad news :(

Can you try this several times ?

or just load the saved workspace and then quit ?

In response to Professor de Leuuw's and Professor Iacus' respective announcements, the MacStats web page "R on the Mac" at
	http://homepage.mac.com/MacStats/R
has been updated with info on R-1.3.0.

This includes links to the relevant info, including the packages Prof. de Leuuw mentions to get gnome working under OS X without buying XTools. As before, the page has links to other info about R and this list.

The page is intended to be a one-stop introduction to R for Mac users who have not used R before. Thus it is probably too basic for any readers of this list, but please suggest it to all your friends. :-) The goal is to make it easy for Mac users to decide whether R is appropriate for their needs, and which port they will want to use.

I would appreciate it if you would let me know if you spot any errors or have any other ideas for changes to this page (or any of the other R or MacStats pages).
