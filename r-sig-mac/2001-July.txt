Dear Stefano,

If you write.table twice (e.g. with slight variations) to the same file, a second copy with the SAME filename is produces (in one folder)
(you have to use the command-info bex to distiguish by date/time).
Not very Mac OS 9 like!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]plot hidden grid lines
Message-ID: <p05010403b77490331c6a@[193.170.84.51]>

Dear Stefano,

It is hard to plot hidden grid lines, e.g. in barplot, covered by the bars.

I do it by doing the barplot, drawing the grid, and painting the bars again (see appendix). Not very satisfactory (and concerning the slow graphics further reducing speed). It comes near to rewriting barplot. If you advise me on the original code to determine the axes (and how to get the appropriate panel variables = what par() 's are used? Are the par()s /din,fin,pin,mai.../ enough or do I need more?) I would do this for my puposes.

But there is a better solution:
What is missing is an implementation of panel.first
See example in plot.default {base}   :
> data(cars)
> Speed <- cars$speed
> Distance <- cars$dist
> plot(Speed, Distance, panel.first = grid(8,8),
+      pch = 0, cex = 1.2, col = "blue")
> 
plot(Speed, Distance,
     panel.first = lines(lowess(Speed, Distance), lty = "dashed"),
     pch = 0, cex = 1.2, col = "blue")
>

Another way may be to use par(new=T) for continuing to paint on an empty plot?
(I do not know if axis are set up un a comparable way).

May be somebody has a better solution?

Dear Stefano,

Actually panel.first works somehow but not as I expected

jjbp<- barplot(1:5, panel.first=lines(c(0,5),c(1,2),lty="dashed"))
> jjbp    # position of bar mids
     [,1]
[1,]  0.7
[2,]  1.9
[3,]  3.1
[4,]  4.3
[5,]  5.5
> 
starts a line at c(0,5) but goes upward
(I understand it should advance from (0,1) to (5,2) 
 but it also does not work for (0,5)-(1,2)   ) 
somehow the axes/units seem to be mixed up.

After playing around I realize:
axes are probably scaled such that the xlim=ylim=c(0,1)
with this 
jjbp<- barplot(1:5, panel.first=abline(h=2/5,lty="dashed"))
works.

Is this what is intended? does R work this way on other platforms?
I assumed the axes of the barplot should be used.

abline uses the yaxis as main abscissa 
jjbp<- barplot(seq(0,1,0.2), panel.first=abline(0.5,-1))

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Which version should I use?
Message-ID: <3B54E06B.9F17E46C@lbl.gov>

Apologies for the 0th-order question.  

I'm a longtime user of Splus, but I am switching (or trying, anyway) to
the Mac, and would like to take this opportunity to try R.  I'm mostly
hoping to _use_ R, not work on it, though I am of course happy to submit
bug reports and that sort of thing.

My immediate question is: should I use the Carbon/Iacus or the
Cocoa(?)/deLeeuw version?  Are there major functional differences?  Are
they similar in terms of stability?  Are there likely to be any
difficulties in set-up, or do they both "just work"; for the latter
question, does the specific species of X-windows matter?

Thanks in advance for answers, and thank you all for working on this
software.

It's the Darwin/deLeeuw version. There is no Cocoa version
yet, by anybody.

The answer to the question about which version to use is
not straightforward. If you want to run on OS 9 as well as
OS X, you have to use Carbon/Iacus. If you are a Mac
person through and through you will probably use that
one too. If you like the Aqua interface and the menus,
same preference.

If you are used to Unix/X11, then the Darwin/deLeeuw
version may be more appealing. Or if  you like to change
window managers every other day. Or if you like the menus
that come with the gnome interface and run R from the
gnome desktop. Or if you like to use update.packages().
Or if you want to be able to add additional packages a
bit more easily. Or if you want to use tcl/tk. Or Emacs
and ESS.

So far, I have somewhat of a bad conscience to use my
Mac as a Darwin/X11 machine, but I think the Darwin/deLeeuw
version is somewhat more complete and convenient for my
particular tastes. Eventually, I hope to be able to switch back
to a version that does not use X11, maybe to a Cocoa
interface to R running in Darwin (as we already have for
Perl, for Scheme48, for Chaitin's Lisp, for mySQL, for
Apache, and for Squeak)

I have installed and used both. Jan's summary is pretty good.

I don't remember whether the jpeg graphics driver is available in the 
native (Iacus) version (and can't check right now); it definitely is 
in the X11 (de Leeuw) version. Both have the postscript() graphics 
driver functioning. I have not yet tried dynamic linking to code 
written in another language (eg, fortran or C) with either version; 
that's a potential major difference.

The native version works "out of the box" so to speak. You definitely 
will want to install some version of X-windows to use the X11 
version, so there is some extra work there. I don't think it matters 
which X11 you use (there are only two to choose from, as far as I 
know, and they're fairly comparable, in my opinion, having tried 
both).

Actually, both versions of R are pretty easy to install, so you 
shouldn't rule out trying them both yourself.

Jan version is a unix build for Darwin/X11.
For a unix user it is probably the "first best". "My" version is 
intedend to work on earlier versions of MacOS up to OSX.

I'm confident that Jan build is more stable then the carbon version. 
Major problems in my version is that I have to implement several stuff 
that are given for free under unix but not under MacOS and its 
compilers (!).

Both version accept dynamic linking well. Packages are examples of that.

As I am the only (actually) developer of R for MacOS and there are many 
things to implement it is not always esay for me that fix/implement all 
and R/Mac users are really precious for their feedback to me.

There is now a Cocoa port of Emacs 20.7 (i.e. a Cocoa wrapper around the
Darwin Emacs) at http://www.porkrind.org/emacs/. Of course there were
already command line versions of Emacs, as well as X11 versions of
Emacs and XEmacs.

These X11 versions you can get from fink at http://fink.sourceforge.net.
Fink is a way cool system to maintain and update and patch and install
packages for Darwin. Just install fink, and then get the various updates
from the CVS, and install them more or less automagically. Fink has
now about 200 packages (one of them is R-base).

Since yesterday, fink also has a version of g77. This is a fink 
adaptation
of the g77 for Darwin done by http://www-
jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/macosx/10.0.X/,
which has many interesting packages available as RPM.

O, yes, fink also has rootless Xfree86.

=====================

Once you have installed the rm130 distribution of R for Macintosh
you should substitute the module "lapackLib" that you find in
the folder

rm130/modules/

with the file with the same name that you find in the archive

lapackLib.hqx


Simply unstuff the file "lapackLib.hqx" and move the resulting
"lapackLib" file to the directory "rm130/modules". If the Finder
asks you to replace the existing file, say "YES".

You will we be now able to use the fast lapack library.

This is a msg to inform you about the state of the art of R porting for 
the Macintosh.

I'm grateful to all the people who are sending me feedback. This will 
not be lost and I hope to fix most of the problems in version 1.4.0 of R.

What to expect for version 1.3.1 of R (mid august probably):
This will be mostly a techincal update (in the mac side)

My actual work now it to abandon the CodeWarrior compile in favour of 
Apple's MPW.

Two reasons for this (mainly):
1) makefiles are available
2) MPW is free from Apple' site

There are several problems in switching to Apple's MPW that I'm trying 
to solve. Most of the problems are linked with the standard C libraries 
that make R (but several other famous carbon applications) fail to run 
under OS X.
Apple is going to release a major fixing for this and as soon as it is 
available I'll adopt it.

With point 1) I have in mind possible future Mac/R developers but also 
users that wants to build their own packages for R.

The biggest part of delay in releasing precompiled contributed packages 
is that I have to build them one by one with almost an ad hoc procedure. 
Now with MPW all will be automated and simpler.

Have a good summer

Sure. You have enlightened me recently about quantum
statistics , so it's only fair. This may be
useful to other people as well, so I'll copy to the
r-sig-mac list.

X11 or X11R6 is the X Window system. This is client-server software to 
display
and manage desktops on networked machines. So if you
write an X client program, you can run it on one machine, and
display its windows on any other machine on the net which has the
X server program running (and which gives you permission
to display). X comes with various widget libraries that
make it easier to do graphics programming, and with a whole
bunch of client programs. Some of these client programs are
called window managers, they determine the details of how
your windows look (popup menus, scroll bars, and so on)
and move. So the Mac Finder is, among other things, a
window manager. Typically X programs run on Unix, but
there are also X servers for Windows and even for Mac OS
(classic). There are not many client programs for X11 on
MacOS, but of course you can run programs such as
Xemacs, Xdvi, Xpdf etc remotely on a Unix box and have
them display their window on your Mac running the X server.

Darwin is Apple latest version of the Unix operating system,
based on a combination of FreeBSD and the Mach kernel
from CMU. It is the core of MacOS X, but MacOS X is written
in such a way that Darwin is invisible to end users (unless
they open the Terminal application). For programmers, and
for dabblers like me, MacOS X is very attractive, because
it allows you to work under MacOS X (in the Mac like
interface), on the Unix command line (in Terminal), and
(after installing an X11 server and clients for Darwin) in
X Window. The big step ahead is that virtually all Unix
and X11 software ports to the Darwin layer of MacOS X
with almost no effort at all. And the major benefit is that
so much scientific software exists for Unix/X11. So the
only thing you need is source code, and it will usually
compile without problems. This is what I did for my X11
version of R on Darwin (which assumes there is an
X server on the local machine). I also compiled support
for gnome (a desktop system on top of X11, which in this
cases provides buttons and menus to R windows) and
for tcl/tk which allows you to write programs in R
with graphical user interfaces (again, on top of X11).

On MacOS X you can run software in many different
ways, depending on what type of software it is. Previous
Mac programs run in an emulation layer called Classic,
with is comparable to emulators such as VirtualPC. You
can run PowerPC applications in this "Mac in a Mac",
with some loss of efficiency.

There is also specially written software which uses the
Carbon libraries. Programs using Carbon can run
natively on MacOS 8 or MacOS 9, but they also run
natively on Mac OS X (i.e. they do not need the Classic
emulation layer). They have the Aqua look, i.e. the
"traffic light" buttons at the top, and the "lickable" look.
If Carbon programs run on OS X, they have advanced
virtual memory, protected memory, symmetric multiprocessing,
and so on. This means that when a Carbon program running
in OS X goes down, nothing else goes down. A Classic
program running in OS X that bombs tales Classic down
with it, but the rest keep sunning smoothly. A Classic
Program in Classic takes the whole system down, and
requires a reboot. Stefano's version of R is a Carbon
program.

So Carbon is an API (Application Programmer Interface)
that gives programmers access to a cleaned up and extended
version of the MacOS Toolbox (the Classic API) and that makes
most of the advanced services of MacOS X available. Cocoa
is another API (the latest version of NextStep for MacOS X),
with it you can write Cocao applications that only run on
MacOS X (not in Classic, not on older Macs running MacOS 8
or MacOS 9). They use even more of the Mac OS X facilities
(the multiprocessing, for instance), and they have characteristic
GUI (graphical user interface) elements that makes them
easily recognizable (in addition to the Aqua look, which they
share with Carbon applications). A Cocoa programmer could fairly easily
write a Cocoa driver for the Darwin version of R. I think that
would be the ideal version of R for OS X.

Although you did not ask, there is also Quartz, which is the

the following code? It runs on a Pentium III 600 MH with 57 seconds.
Please indicate the hardware configration. Thanks in advance.

I am assuming you want the difference between the two date()
(before and after) returned.

This is on a single-processor 733 Mhz G4.

R-1.3.0 Carbon running natively in OS X: 32 seconds
R-1.3.0 Darwin: 35 seconds
R-2.0.0 Darwin: 34 seconds

This suggests that the two implementations have about the
same speed, and that they are about twice as fast as a PIII/600
(which happens to be equal to the Steve Jobs Demo Factor).

About 34 seconds on a 400 MHz G3, R 1.2.2, OS 9.1
(not OS X, I can probably test that later today or tomorrow with R 1.2.3)

Don MacQueen wants to know why his 400Mhz G3 is as fast as my
733 MHz G4. Good question, easy answer. The speeds below are
all on a single processor 733 MHz G4, with the standard R-1.3.0.

Carbon running in OS 9.2 -- 21secs
Carbon running in Classic in OS X -- 23 secs
Carbon running natively in OS X -- 32 secs
Darwin running natively (vanilla) in OS X -- 35 secs

Apple obviously stiil has a lot of work to do before 10.1. But even the
OS X versions leave the PIII in the dust. Wait until I get my dual 800
MHz machine.

Too which I can now add

R 1.3.0 Darwin running in an XFree86 X11 context in OS X, 400 MHz G3 -- 48 secs
R 1.2.2 Carbon running in OS 9.2, 400 MHz G3 -- 34 secs (as reported yesterday)

Re-enforcing the conclusion that OS X 10.0.4 is slow compared to OS 9.x

version 1.3. My result was done on R 1.3, Pentium III 600 MHz running
Win 98.I tried also on a Pentium III 700 Mhs labtop running WIN Me and
I got 49 seconds. So opertaing system seems to have a significant

Dear Stefano,

If you write.table twice (e.g. with slight variations) to the same file, a second copy with the SAME filename is produces (in one folder)
(you have to use the command-info bex to distiguish by date/time).
Not very Mac OS 9 like!

Message-ID: <p05010403b77490331c6a@[193.170.84.51]>

Dear Stefano,

It is hard to plot hidden grid lines, e.g. in barplot, covered by the bars.

I do it by doing the barplot, drawing the grid, and painting the bars again (see appendix). Not very satisfactory (and concerning the slow graphics further reducing speed). It comes near to rewriting barplot. If you advise me on the original code to determine the axes (and how to get the appropriate panel variables = what par() 's are used? Are the par()s /din,fin,pin,mai.../ enough or do I need more?) I would do this for my puposes.

But there is a better solution:
What is missing is an implementation of panel.first
See example in plot.default {base}   :
> data(cars)
> Speed <- cars$speed
> Distance <- cars$dist
> plot(Speed, Distance, panel.first = grid(8,8),
+      pch = 0, cex = 1.2, col = "blue")
> 
plot(Speed, Distance,
     panel.first = lines(lowess(Speed, Distance), lty = "dashed"),
     pch = 0, cex = 1.2, col = "blue")
>

Another way may be to use par(new=T) for continuing to paint on an empty plot?
(I do not know if axis are set up un a comparable way).

May be somebody has a better solution?

Peter

Dear Stefano,

Actually panel.first works somehow but not as I expected

jjbp<- barplot(1:5, panel.first=lines(c(0,5),c(1,2),lty="dashed"))
> jjbp    # position of bar mids
     [,1]
[1,]  0.7
[2,]  1.9
[3,]  3.1
[4,]  4.3
[5,]  5.5
> 
starts a line at c(0,5) but goes upward
(I understand it should advance from (0,1) to (5,2) 
 but it also does not work for (0,5)-(1,2)   ) 
somehow the axes/units seem to be mixed up.

After playing around I realize:
axes are probably scaled such that the xlim=ylim=c(0,1)
with this 
jjbp<- barplot(1:5, panel.first=abline(h=2/5,lty="dashed"))
works.

Is this what is intended? does R work this way on other platforms?
I assumed the axes of the barplot should be used.

abline uses the yaxis as main abscissa 
jjbp<- barplot(seq(0,1,0.2), panel.first=abline(0.5,-1))

Message-ID: <3B54E06B.9F17E46C@lbl.gov>

Apologies for the 0th-order question.  

I'm a longtime user of Splus, but I am switching (or trying, anyway) to
the Mac, and would like to take this opportunity to try R.  I'm mostly
hoping to _use_ R, not work on it, though I am of course happy to submit
bug reports and that sort of thing.

My immediate question is: should I use the Carbon/Iacus or the
Cocoa(?)/deLeeuw version?  Are there major functional differences?  Are
they similar in terms of stability?  Are there likely to be any
difficulties in set-up, or do they both "just work"; for the latter
question, does the specific species of X-windows matter?

Thanks in advance for answers, and thank you all for working on this

It's the Darwin/deLeeuw version. There is no Cocoa version
yet, by anybody.

The answer to the question about which version to use is
not straightforward. If you want to run on OS 9 as well as
OS X, you have to use Carbon/Iacus. If you are a Mac
person through and through you will probably use that
one too. If you like the Aqua interface and the menus,
same preference.

If you are used to Unix/X11, then the Darwin/deLeeuw
version may be more appealing. Or if  you like to change
window managers every other day. Or if you like the menus
that come with the gnome interface and run R from the
gnome desktop. Or if you like to use update.packages().
Or if you want to be able to add additional packages a
bit more easily. Or if you want to use tcl/tk. Or Emacs
and ESS.

So far, I have somewhat of a bad conscience to use my
Mac as a Darwin/X11 machine, but I think the Darwin/deLeeuw
version is somewhat more complete and convenient for my
particular tastes. Eventually, I hope to be able to switch back
to a version that does not use X11, maybe to a Cocoa
interface to R running in Darwin (as we already have for
Perl, for Scheme48, for Chaitin's Lisp, for mySQL, for
Apache, and for Squeak)

I have installed and used both. Jan's summary is pretty good.

I don't remember whether the jpeg graphics driver is available in the 
native (Iacus) version (and can't check right now); it definitely is 
in the X11 (de Leeuw) version. Both have the postscript() graphics 
driver functioning. I have not yet tried dynamic linking to code 
written in another language (eg, fortran or C) with either version; 
that's a potential major difference.

The native version works "out of the box" so to speak. You definitely 
will want to install some version of X-windows to use the X11 
version, so there is some extra work there. I don't think it matters 
which X11 you use (there are only two to choose from, as far as I 
know, and they're fairly comparable, in my opinion, having tried 
both).

Actually, both versions of R are pretty easy to install, so you 
shouldn't rule out trying them both yourself.

Jan version is a unix build for Darwin/X11.
For a unix user it is probably the "first best". "My" version is 
intedend to work on earlier versions of MacOS up to OSX.

I'm confident that Jan build is more stable then the carbon version. 
Major problems in my version is that I have to implement several stuff 
that are given for free under unix but not under MacOS and its 
compilers (!).

Both version accept dynamic linking well. Packages are examples of that.

As I am the only (actually) developer of R for MacOS and there are many 
things to implement it is not always esay for me that fix/implement all 
and R/Mac users are really precious for their feedback to me.

Stefano
p.s. thanks to Don for its opinion

Message-ID: <200107241448.HAA78776@pine.frazmtn.com>

There is now a Cocoa port of Emacs 20.7 (i.e. a Cocoa wrapper around the
Darwin Emacs) at http://www.porkrind.org/emacs/. Of course there were
already command line versions of Emacs, as well as X11 versions of
Emacs and XEmacs.

These X11 versions you can get from fink at http://fink.sourceforge.net.
Fink is a way cool system to maintain and update and patch and install
packages for Darwin. Just install fink, and then get the various updates
from the CVS, and install them more or less automagically. Fink has
now about 200 packages (one of them is R-base).

Since yesterday, fink also has a version of g77. This is a fink 
adaptation
of the g77 for Darwin done by http://www-
jlc.kek.jp/~fujiik/macosx/10.0.X/,
which has many interesting packages available as RPM.

O, yes, fink also has rootless Xfree86.

This is un update/fixing for the lapack module for rm 130.
You'll find the cited file on CRAN starting from tomorrow or directly at

lapackLib patch for:

R 1.3.0 for Macintosh
=====================

Once you have installed the rm130 distribution of R for Macintosh
you should substitute the module "lapackLib" that you find in
the folder

rm130/modules/

with the file with the same name that you find in the archive

lapackLib.hqx


Simply unstuff the file "lapackLib.hqx" and move the resulting
"lapackLib" file to the directory "rm130/modules". If the Finder
asks you to replace the existing file, say "YES".

You will we be now able to use the fast lapack library.

This is a msg to inform you about the state of the art of R porting for 
the Macintosh.

I'm grateful to all the people who are sending me feedback. This will 
not be lost and I hope to fix most of the problems in version 1.4.0 of R.

What to expect for version 1.3.1 of R (mid august probably):
This will be mostly a techincal update (in the mac side)

My actual work now it to abandon the CodeWarrior compile in favour of 
Apple's MPW.

Two reasons for this (mainly):
1) makefiles are available
2) MPW is free from Apple' site

There are several problems in switching to Apple's MPW that I'm trying 
to solve. Most of the problems are linked with the standard C libraries 
that make R (but several other famous carbon applications) fail to run 
under OS X.
Apple is going to release a major fixing for this and as soon as it is 
available I'll adopt it.

With point 1) I have in mind possible future Mac/R developers but also 
users that wants to build their own packages for R.

The biggest part of delay in releasing precompiled contributed packages 
is that I have to build them one by one with almost an ad hoc procedure. 
Now with MPW all will be automated and simpler.

Have a good summer

Sure. You have enlightened me recently about quantum
statistics , so it's only fair. This may be
useful to other people as well, so I'll copy to the
r-sig-mac list.

X11 or X11R6 is the X Window system. This is client-server software to 
display
and manage desktops on networked machines. So if you
write an X client program, you can run it on one machine, and
display its windows on any other machine on the net which has the
X server program running (and which gives you permission
to display). X comes with various widget libraries that
make it easier to do graphics programming, and with a whole
bunch of client programs. Some of these client programs are
called window managers, they determine the details of how
your windows look (popup menus, scroll bars, and so on)
and move. So the Mac Finder is, among other things, a
window manager. Typically X programs run on Unix, but
there are also X servers for Windows and even for Mac OS
(classic). There are not many client programs for X11 on
MacOS, but of course you can run programs such as
Xemacs, Xdvi, Xpdf etc remotely on a Unix box and have
them display their window on your Mac running the X server.

Darwin is Apple latest version of the Unix operating system,
based on a combination of FreeBSD and the Mach kernel
from CMU. It is the core of MacOS X, but MacOS X is written
in such a way that Darwin is invisible to end users (unless
they open the Terminal application). For programmers, and
for dabblers like me, MacOS X is very attractive, because
it allows you to work under MacOS X (in the Mac like
interface), on the Unix command line (in Terminal), and
(after installing an X11 server and clients for Darwin) in
X Window. The big step ahead is that virtually all Unix
and X11 software ports to the Darwin layer of MacOS X
with almost no effort at all. And the major benefit is that
so much scientific software exists for Unix/X11. So the
only thing you need is source code, and it will usually
compile without problems. This is what I did for my X11
version of R on Darwin (which assumes there is an
X server on the local machine). I also compiled support
for gnome (a desktop system on top of X11, which in this
cases provides buttons and menus to R windows) and
for tcl/tk which allows you to write programs in R
with graphical user interfaces (again, on top of X11).

On MacOS X you can run software in many different
ways, depending on what type of software it is. Previous
Mac programs run in an emulation layer called Classic,
with is comparable to emulators such as VirtualPC. You
can run PowerPC applications in this "Mac in a Mac",
with some loss of efficiency.

There is also specially written software which uses the
Carbon libraries. Programs using Carbon can run
natively on MacOS 8 or MacOS 9, but they also run
natively on Mac OS X (i.e. they do not need the Classic
emulation layer). They have the Aqua look, i.e. the
"traffic light" buttons at the top, and the "lickable" look.
If Carbon programs run on OS X, they have advanced
virtual memory, protected memory, symmetric multiprocessing,
and so on. This means that when a Carbon program running
in OS X goes down, nothing else goes down. A Classic
program running in OS X that bombs tales Classic down
with it, but the rest keep sunning smoothly. A Classic
Program in Classic takes the whole system down, and
requires a reboot. Stefano's version of R is a Carbon
program.

So Carbon is an API (Application Programmer Interface)
that gives programmers access to a cleaned up and extended
version of the MacOS Toolbox (the Classic API) and that makes
most of the advanced services of MacOS X available. Cocoa
is another API (the latest version of NextStep for MacOS X),
with it you can write Cocao applications that only run on
MacOS X (not in Classic, not on older Macs running MacOS 8
or MacOS 9). They use even more of the Mac OS X facilities
(the multiprocessing, for instance), and they have characteristic
GUI (graphical user interface) elements that makes them
easily recognizable (in addition to the Aqua look, which they
share with Carbon applications). A Cocoa programmer could fairly easily
write a Cocoa driver for the Darwin version of R. I think that
would be the ideal version of R for OS X.

Although you did not ask, there is also Quartz, which is the
rendering engine that draws to the screen and to printers. It
replaces Quickdraw from Classic and DisplayPostscript from
Next -- it's native file format is pdf (which makes using TeX
on MacOS X a real pleasure -- TexShop is a Cocoa shell
around the teTeX system, which is living in the Darwin
layer).

I am assuming you want the difference between the two date()
(before and after) returned.

This is on a single-processor 733 Mhz G4.

R-1.3.0 Carbon running natively in OS X: 32 seconds
R-1.3.0 Darwin: 35 seconds
R-2.0.0 Darwin: 34 seconds

This suggests that the two implementations have about the
same speed, and that they are about twice as fast as a PIII/600
(which happens to be equal to the Steve Jobs Demo Factor).

About 34 seconds on a 400 MHz G3, R 1.2.2, OS 9.1
(not OS X, I can probably test that later today or tomorrow with R 1.2.3)

Don MacQueen wants to know why his 400Mhz G3 is as fast as my
733 MHz G4. Good question, easy answer. The speeds below are
all on a single processor 733 MHz G4, with the standard R-1.3.0.

Carbon running in OS 9.2 -- 21secs
Carbon running in Classic in OS X -- 23 secs
Carbon running natively in OS X -- 32 secs
Darwin running natively (vanilla) in OS X -- 35 secs

Apple obviously stiil has a lot of work to do before 10.1. But even the
OS X versions leave the PIII in the dust. Wait until I get my dual 800
MHz machine.

Too which I can now add

R 1.3.0 Darwin running in an XFree86 X11 context in OS X, 400 MHz G3 -- 48 secs
R 1.2.2 Carbon running in OS 9.2, 400 MHz G3 -- 34 secs (as reported yesterday)

Re-enforcing the conclusion that OS X 10.0.4 is slow compared to OS 9.x

I would like to add that Bill Oliver got 31 seconds on his Dell
Dimension Pentium III 600 MHz,256 MB RAM running Windows 2000 and R
version 1.3. My result was done on R 1.3, Pentium III 600 MHz running
Win 98.I tried also on a Pentium III 700 Mhs labtop running WIN Me and
I got 49 seconds. So opertaing system seems to have a significant
impact.
