Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] undo in Editor does not truly "undo"
Message-ID: <798BA760-5F5E-11D9-BB11-000393707CF2@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

This applies to the new R gui for Panther.
I often lose changes I make to my text files (R programs) in the gui 
editor. I appreciate the fact that selected lines are "sent to the 
console" when you press command-return. Much faster than copy and paste 
from my external text editor, TextWrangler, to the console, which I 
must continue to do on my PowerBook running 10.2.8.

But sometimes I slip, and do not press command, or I forget that lines 
are selected and start typing. In both cases the selected lines vanish. 
When this happens you should be able to fix the problem by doing Undo. 
But in the R editor, Undo brings me back to a previous state, I'm not 
sure which (when I opened the file?), and I have to add by hand the 
lines that have vanished plus the changes I had made since that "saved" 
state.

I am using 1.02-pre build 879

Is this happening to others as well?

Thanks,

Denis

It seems that something, perhaps the migration of devices to grDevices, 
has broken the OS X GUI. In particular,  ptr_getQuartzParameters is no 
longer being defined (I wouldn't be surprised if nothing in aqua.c is 
being included since HAVE_AQUA doesn't appear to be set anywhere 
despite --enable-aqua in the configure args). Clean builds of both.

Hi Denis,

This is indeed a known (and awkward) issue. It was flagged early 
December and I did
look at what it would take to fix it. Turns out fixing it within the 
document architecture
is simple, but in the current structure of R.app, where R Console is 
not really a
document, it is hard (the main menu becomes very confused). Not sure if 
Stefano or
Simon know a way around this, I would be happy to try out ideas.

About a year ago I implemented command-E (source file) and 
command-return (source
selection) using AppleScript, which allows one to use an external 
editor. To make this
work well, you do need something like iKey to define hot keys across 
applications.

Wow, there is indeed a huge difference in elapsed time for nbinom.
Almost linear with the length of x.

The non-GUI version stays around a second or so, for  length(x) == 871, 
the GUI
version takes ~25 seconds, for length(x)==8701, the GUI version takes 
~250 secs.

It seems only to occur with nbinom. Norm, binom, exp, gamma etc. all 
are within 1
or 2 seconds.

The curves I'm getting are identical though. In all runs the 2 curves 
did overlap.

Hi,

How is it decided what packages are offered as binaries for Mac and 
what other packages are only offered as source? Is it by "popular 
demand"? If so, I suggest adding Hmisc to the binaries for Mac OS X. I 
tend to go see those first when trying to find which packages might be 
of use to me. Hence I did not discover this package until someone 
recommended it to me. It seems quite useful and maybe others would use 
it to.

Anyway, I installed it on an iMac running Panther and got a warning at 
the end of the installation, something about chmod not being allowed. 
It seems to work though.

I just installed it on my PB running Jaguar and got this:

Warning message:
Installation of package Hmisc had non-zero exit status in: 
install.packages(ui.pkgs, CRAN = getOption(where), contriburl = 
contriburl,


Should I be worried?

Thanks,

Denis

Hi,

Follow up:

Warning message:
Installation of package Hmisc had non-zero exit status in: 
install.packages(ui.pkgs, CRAN = getOption(where), contriburl = 
contriburl,

This message did mean trouble, as installation was incomplete. 
Downloading the source package and installing from local files did not 
work either. I think I have not installed the Developer's CD on this 
old Mac. I'm not sure I'd be able to in the short term since I'm on 
sabbatical and did not bring all my CD's with me.

I cannot find out myself until tonight (the iMac is at home, I'm not), 
but will Hmisc compiled on Panther work under Jaguar? If so I'll be OK. 
If not, I'd really appreciate if someone could compile Hmisc to work 
under Jaguar and send it to me. Or place it in the Mac Binaries on CRAN.

Sincerely,

Denis Chabot

Hi,
binary packages are put CRAN  only if they pass successfully the CHECK 
(R CMD CHECK) without errors.
I'll see what's the problem with Hmisc is. I'm just back from traveling 
and a very long "to-do list" of thing to manage, fix etc.

The developer tools can be download from http://connect.apple.com/  It
does require a free registration and the December 2002 Tools (which
work under 10.2, XCode does not) are a 301.2MB download when you click
on "Download Software" and then "Developer Tools" and scroll to the
bottom of the page.

Good luck,

Paul

Message-ID: <09E214C1-63BB-11D9-9451-000A95CD7F02@sheffield.ac.uk>

Hi all - (this is posted to r-help and R-SIG-MAC)

OSX 10.3.7, R 2.0.1, lme4/Matrix/latticeExtra latest, fresh install of 
R. MASS loaded (or not).

I am getting an error message for the print() and summary() commands 
with all lme models I try and run in lme4 (GLMM's work fine).  Using 
the example from the lme help, summary and print produce the following 
errors, despite the model being fit, as indicated by VarCorr() and 
examination of str(fm).  Any ideas?

(I can't reproduce this on a windows95 install of 2.0.1, so I am 
guessing it may be a mac thing at the moment?  This happens with the 
binary or the source installation of lme4.)

Cheers
andrew

Check what packages you have loaded.  It looks as if you have loaded 
lme4 and nlme at the same time and you their methods will conflict.

Thank you Paul.

I did find my Developer's CD and installed it. I could not install 
Hmisc. I noticed that when installing the developper's cd, many items 
were "updates". Maybe this CD only works if you still have the 
developer's stuff from OS X 10.1? I downloaded from the link you have 
given, and this appears to duplicate what I had on CD. I decided to 
install it anyway, and again I noticed that most items were "updates". 
After installation was finished, I launched R and tried to install 
Hmisc from source on CRAN. I got the same message as before:

Warning message:
Installation of package Hmisc had non-zero exit status in: 
install.packages(ui.pkgs, CRAN = getOption(where), contriburl = 
contriburl,

So maybe I don't have everything that is required on my HD, because not 
much "compiling" was done: the Hmisc folder has only 3 items 
(DESCRIPTION, libs (empty folder) and Meta (folder containing only 
package.rds). The version compiled on my iMac running Panther has a lot 
more, 8 folders plus 3 items (CONTENTS, INDEX and DESCRIPTION). 
Unfortunately, that version does not work under Jaguar on my PB.

So I'm stuck, I guess I'll go home to produce my summary statistics on 
my iMac :-)

Denis,

Whenever packages do not install properly on my system, I tend to check  
2 items.

The 1st item is the 00LOCK directory created in the install directory.  
 From your
emails, that does not seem to be the case. If the 00LOCK directory is  
present, I
remove it:

rob-goedmans-Computer:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.1/ 
Resources/library rob$ ls -lia 00LOCK
total 0
8595945 drwxr-xr-x    3 rob   admin    102 11 Jan 10:24 .
7251315 drwxrwxr-x  562 root  admin  19108 11 Jan 10:24 ..
8088115 drwxr-xr-x   17 root  admin    578 16 Nov 04:25 survival

rob-goedmans-Computer:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.1/ 
Resources/library rob$ sudo rm -rf 00LOCK/

On very long installs (e.g. update.packages() with many 'y' answers), I  
do see the 00LOCK
problem occuring several times. Haven't figured out why this is  
happening, e.g. in my last
update run, why in case of survival it does not remove the 00LOCK  
directory, but for dse1 or
StatDataML and many others it does.

The 2nd item is the ownership of R.css in the install directory. If it  
is root:

rob-goedmans-Computer:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.1/ 
Resources/library rob$ ls -lia R.css
8521485 -rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  608 11 Jan 10:23 R.css

I change it:

sudo chown rob R.css

I believe this issue can generate the warning message you mentioned. In  
this example
I am user 'rob' and in the 'admin' group.

Installing Hmisc from source does trigger 7 or 8 compilations or so.

All of this on 10.3.7 with R-2.0.1 and typically the latest R.app from  
Simon.

Hope this helps,
Rob

A step-by-step guide to build R and hence the packages can be found on 
http://www.economia.unimi.it/R or in the FAQ of R for Mac OS X.

To understand what's really failing try, to download the Hmisc package 
from source on your HD.
then from the shell type
R CMD INSTALL Hmisc

Hi All,

I was wondering if there are any known issues in the ability to use the
identify() function to identify points in a graph when the graph is
displayed in a Quartz window.

Dear all,

R-devel using configuration flags

I am not so successful compiling R.app from the most recent svn version

This is an issue that a student is running into using the identify
function. Here is an example problem he reported:

Dan,
Your example works fine for me on R cocoa v1.01.    See below.

Click on the points of interest being displayed in the Quartz window.
Hit "ESC" if using Quartz device.
The labels show up on the graph at this point.
The error "no point with 0.25 inches" is returned if you clicked on the 
graph more than 0.25 inches from the closest point.
(I suppose it should read, "no point within 0.25 inches".)

Message-ID: <p06110407be1445a3fc3f@[128.115.153.6]>

I'm encountering a problem formatting POSIXct objects in R 2.0.1 on OS X.

For reference, on a Solaris system, R 2.0.1 (2004-11-15), formatting 
is correct:

>  Sys.time()
[1] "2005-01-19 09:12:33 PST"
>  format(Sys.time(),'%H:%M %Z')
[1] "09:12 PST"


On Mac OS X, however,

R 2.0.1 Patched 2005-01-19

>  Sys.time()
[1] "2005-01-19 09:18:27 PST"
>  format(Sys.time(),'%H:%M %Z')
[1] "09:18 P"


Or an earlier version of R 2.0.1,  R 2.0.1 2004-11-15
>  Sys.time()
[1] "2005-01-19 09:17:23 PST"
>  format(Sys.time(),'%H:%M %Z')
[1] "09:17 8"


Both Macs are at 10.3.7

The R patched was built from source code with
      configure --enable-R-shlib --with-blas='-framework vecLib' 
--with-lapack --with-aqua >& dhm.config.log

The other R was built from source code with
     configure --enable-R-shlib --with-blas='-framework vecLib' 
--with-lapack --enable-R-framework=no >& dhm.config.log

Changing the TZ environment variable, from the default of "" to 
"US/Pacific" does not help.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

The man pages says:
    usetz: logical.  Should the timezone be appended to the output? This
           is used in printing time, and as a workaround for problems
           with using '"%Z"' on most Linux systems.

so after reading that, you get the correct result:

 > format(Sys.time(),'%H:%M',usetz=TRUE)
[1] "15:57 EST"

Now, the reason why I'm CCing this to R-devel is that in fact the 
datetime.c is somewhat weird for non-GlibC2 systems as tm.tm_zone is 
not initialized at all, which I suspect is a bug. Either the docs 
should state that %Z should not be used at all or I'd propose the 
following patch to make it work (warning, it's a patch against 
R-devel):

Doing so has no effect for you, because the time zone is correct as you 
demonstrated yourself in the above output.

Simon,

There is _no_ tm_tzone component in a POSIX nor C99 tm structure (and I 
have just checked both), so if a system requires it to be set, the bug is 
not in R but in the standards-compliance of the system.  So

> is somewhat weird for non-GlibC2 systems as tm.tm_zone is not

is `somewhat wierd' to me.  glibc2 (at least as documented in man mktime) 
like the standards it references has no such component, so if the header 
file defines one it should be private and strftime seems incorrectly 
implemented.  What we implemented as from the POSIX standard, and at least 
one Solaris system complies (but it seems few others these days).

I am happy to zero the structure, much less happy to reference 
undocumented non-POSIX/C99 components.

Thank you Simon,

I should have found that myself; apologies for not exhausting all 
resources before sending my query.

I got caught because the default values of usetz in
     print.POSIXct
and
     format.POSIXct
are different.

My general experience has been that calling format() on an object 
gives the same format as calling print() -- at least on the objects I 
work with on a regular basis (and they did for POSIXct on Solaris). 
Obviously, the assumption that they would do so in this case and on a 
different platform was unwarranted.

Thanks again,

-Don

p.s. I'm *not* cc'ing to r-devel because my only real addition to 
this thread in this email is the note about the different defaults, 
and I expect the defaults were thought about and explicitly chosen, 
and don't need to be reconsidered.

Hi,
I'm forwarding this msg to R-sig-mac mailing list.
History is handled differently at the moment on the R GUI for Mac OS X.
We have in plan to allow for import/export of "traditional" history 
files.
But, why don't you use a script? The history file is simply a script 
generated by R. You can simply rename .Rhistory to myscript.R and 
source() it in R. On the contrary, it is not that easy to save directly 
to an .Rhistory file from the R GUI at the moment.

stefano

btw: the R GUI for Mac OS X can handle multiple-line command history 
(and that's the reason why it is not compatible at the moment).

Rene',
did you run "make check" after the building?
BTW, a g5 optimized version of R is in the pipeline and any 
contribution is welcome.
In such a case, please work on R-devel

Dear all,

I'm using R.app (v1.01 and 1.02 pre build 944) on OS X.3.7.

I can't uppgrade sources packages with the GUI because I've messages like
this:

When I use R in the terminal (with sudo), I haven't this problem. I've just
notice this warnings:

perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LC_ALL = (unset),

Do you know what's happend and how I can fix it ?


Thanks in advances

This means that either an installation was aborted w/o cleanup before  
or another installation is already running.

Please note that currently it is not possible in the GUI to  
install/update multiple packages simultaneously if authorizing as root,  
because the root process is spawned independently via Security  
Framework which doesn't give us the child PID and thus the GUI has no  
way of serializing the authorized "system" calls. We are investigating  
ways around this problem. Installing/upgrading as an admin user w/o the  
need to authenticate should work (and individual installs/updates as  
root).

The entire environment is completely different in Terminal and the GUI,  
thus the warning is probably just trying to tell you that you're  
setting up invalid locales in one of your shell startup scripts. This  
has no effect on the GUI as it's not ran via a shell.

Simon

Hi, I thought I'd have a look at "MacOS X check summary" on

this:
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access

Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use 
an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

However I'm allowed to go to "Windows check summary", although that

Is it OK to signal this here, or should I send an email to somebody in

ehm, the first url exists, the second currently not. The problem is 
that my machine running r-devel package building has been reformatted

don't understand what is the problem... can anybody help me out?

My configuration is:

The warnings are "ok" in the sense that there is a known duplication of  
symbol names. You don't need to worry about that.

In the end of your report instead, it seems to be a permission problem  
"chmod etc etc".

Does the lazy package load and work Max?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]
 Command line completion, Help browser navigation buttons,
 Offering code changes for GUI 
Message-ID: <BE2441DA.457F%gsxej2@cam.ac.uk>

Dear Stefano, Simon et al.,

A couple of features which I find are missing from the excellent new Cocoa
GUI are Back/Forwards navigation in the help browser (acknowledged in the To
Do list) and command completion of subvariables (eg the columns of a
dataframe so that you can complete df$T to df$Temperature).  I have
implemented these changes in my own source tree (derived from the Nov-16
snapshot) and wondered whether it would be possible to get them integrated
into the main source.

I had a few additional queries about command completion (which is one of the
features that means I have almost stopped using terminal R/X11).  It seems
to me that these days object names are allowed to have underscores but the
command completion only allows numbers letters and periods.  Additionally I
think it would be very useful if tab completion would display completion
options if there are >1 but < say 50.  I have something working for this but
it is not quite right yet and it will take me a bit longer to figure out how
to write to the GUI console correctly.  Is this potentially interesting
enough that one of the developers might like to do it?

Many thanks,

Greg Jefferis.

For the completion, you can just run things through complete: to get a 
drop down of completion objects (after overriding the source methods). 
Unfortunately, that might be Panther-only---I can't recall off hand.

Dear Marek,
we are not currently experience these problems. I'm forwarding this msg 
to the R-sig-Mac mailing list which the right place for feedback on the 
R Cocoa GUI.
Can you please tell us which is the release of R and R-gui you are 
using? You Mac OS X version?

thanks
stefano

That's right - it's one of my ToDo's. I had looked at the API, but 
didn't use it in the GUI yet.

Even if it was, that's fine as the GUI supports Panther+ only.

Right, I need to commit that at some point - I have a hot fix for one 
of the web windows ... the problem is that we have several instances 
where we use html rendering and I wanted to consolidate those such that 
you don't end up having navigation in one but not the other ... didn't 
have time for that, though :/

Please send me a patch against whatever version you started off with. 
Chances are that it may merge with the current code, especially if only 
the completion classes are involved.

I suspect that the complete: API in Cocoa mentioned by Byron is 
probably the right way to go as it offers the GUI elements for free - 
we just provide the lists. I'll check that...

Cheers,
Simon
