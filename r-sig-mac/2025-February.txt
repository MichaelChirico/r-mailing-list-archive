Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] gfortran 12 vs 14
Message-ID: <AM8PR05MB8002FCD34855CE6AD1DD64DAC0FA2@AM8PR05MB8002.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi!

Just wanted to point out a discrepancy in documentation regarding the gfortran version:


  *   In https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ it says gfortran 12 was used.
  *   In https://mac.r-project.org/tools/ it says to install gfortran 14.

It might be related to R-release vs R-devel, not sure, but it is confusing.

Stefano,

please note that the CRAN page is talking about the R 4.4.2 release and the developer tools page says 

"CRAN R Big Sur builds used gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg for R 4.3.0 up to 4.4.2"

so they are both correct and very explicit with the corresponding links, so I?m not entirely sure which part is confusing. If you have a suggestions that would clarify the confusion, please let me know and I?d be happy to incorporate it.

Cheers,
Simon

Do we expect to stay with gfortran 12.2.0 for 4.4.3 and then switch for 4.5.0?

Most likely - changing version for patch releases doesn't seem necessary.

Thanks for the swift response! Right I see, for some reason I wasn?t associating the Mac tools page with R-devel (since some packages need compilation even if you normally install binaries and that?s why I ended up looking that page up) and I did not connect the R-release to ?Big Sur build?.

maybe it can be pointed out on the tools page that if the user got to that page to compile specific packages rather than compile R, then they should check which gfortran is been used for the released version or something like that? :)

...or, I suppose, it would seem like Just Bad Luck, (binary package compatibility etc.). I'll update the M4 MacBook after 4.4.3 comes out.

(And also see if I can orchestrate moving the nightly builds to that machine before we start the 4.5.0 process. Not that the source tarballs are very dependent on the platform that builds them, but I like to have the implied build tests reasonably in sync with your binaries.)

It also a bad idea because the binary packages are linked to
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libgfortran.5.dylib
so if you start building with gfortran-14, those binaries probably
won't work on R 4.4.0 - 4.4.2 (which has the libgfortran 12 runtime).

Message-ID: <CADFHP58JLbkU_r-ZU-echuGX_Xqtepk3s7Y=83QzjaEmywY4fg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear "R" Foundation rep,

We are trying to install the "R" software for Mac in silent more directly
to the Mac device or creating a package in ManageEngine, whichever option
is chosen, it fails, as follows:

- If we try to download and install the R-4.4.2-arm64.pkg package directly
onto a MacOS
  Silicon device from ManageEngine, the package gives us a ?Installation
failed? error.

- If we try to re-create a package in ManageEngine, using the
R-4.4.2-arm64.pkg file, it
  fails to upload in ManageEngine.

- When installing the R-4.4.2-arm64.pkg  itself from
http://cran.rproject.org/bin/macosx/, the
  application was able to download successfully with no errors. However, it
is not a
  silent installation

- We installed R on an Intel based processor, and the installation was to
totally silent

- How can we get an R software silent installation on a Silicon based
device?

- Is there a different URL we should use to download the correct R software
.pkg for
   Silicon based devices (Silent mode)?
   If so, please share the URL

Please carbon copy dlin at iwu.edu on your reply.

We look forward to your feedback.

Thanks.

David,

I have no idea about "ManageEngine" - you may want to consult the support and documentation of the software you use. On macOS Apple Installer packages can be trivially "silently" installed with

installer -pkg R-4.4.2-arm64.pkg -target /

(prefix with sudo if not run as root). Please see Apple documentation on how to install software on macOS. Nothing about this is R-specific.

Cheers,
Simon

This isn't the address for the R Foundation, but in any case, it would 
have nothing to say about your question.  It's about funding for 
R-related projects, not debugging third party software.

This email list is about community discussions on using the R build on 
MacOS.  So there's a chance that someone here has used ManageEngine and 
will be able to help you, but I haven't ever seen it mentioned before, 
so that might not happen.

In that case I think what you need to do is talk to the support people 
at ManageEngine.  If that doesn't work, they appear to have a number of 
community discussion forums, and those might help.

Another possibility is that you could contact Posit, who sell and 
distribute RStudio.  If you are trying to install it as well as R, then 
they'd have an interest in helping you.
