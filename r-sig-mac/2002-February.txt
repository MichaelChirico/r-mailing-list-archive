Message-ID: <7C4F091F6140D411A29300508B5C73B906D71E59@usrymx04.merck.com>

Hi, all.

I'm trying to compile R-1.4.1 on my Pismo (G3 processor).  I've got fink
installed, with g77 and atlas and dlcompat and everything else I could think
of.  I compiled atlas last night (it took a LONG time!) and R can find it
when I give it the right library arguments.  

However, in my config.log, I get messages like:

	/usr/bin/ld:   warning table of contents of library:
/sw/lib/libatlas.a not sorted
	slower link editing will result (use the ranlib(1) -s option)

If I read this correctly, it means that it will take me a little longer to
compile, but won't cause any problems at runtime.  Is that correct?

One additional question on atlas:  for R, is it generally worth it to
optimize BLAS level 1?  I chose yes because I didn't know.  But if it's not
that important, I'd be happy to save the time someday when I need to update.

Probably not -- in the old days when we only used the Level 1 BLAS there
seemed to be little performance gain from ATLAS on Linux or from the Sun
BLAS on Solaris. YMMV, of course. In particular the Altivec instructions
on G4s could help noticeably.

Well, I am no so sure either -- but I'll check my no-atlas against
atlas on the same machine soon. Altivec is of little use for double
precision floating point, of course.

Message-ID: <91AA1E3F-1861-11D6-B797-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

I was trying out my new 2 x 1Ghz G4, and discovered a  number of
things. The benchmark was

 > hilbert<-function(n) 1/(outer(seq(n),seq(n),"+")-1)
 > system.time(eigen(hilbert(xxx)))

where xxx is 500 or 1000. I compare 4 implementations of R on
the same machine (running Mac OS X 10.1.3 and OS 9.2.2).

In the first place the Carbon version uses about 19 secs for
500 and 160 secs for 1000. This is about 10% faster than on
my previous Mac (Dual 800 MHz). But the Darwin versions
(both development 1.5.0 and official 1.4.1) use 4.7 seconds
for 500 and 50 seconds for 1000 - i.e. the Darwin version is
three times as fast as the Carbon version (with this benchmark
and with this machine). The 1.5.0 uses ATLAS, the 1.4.1 does
not, and that does not seem to make a difference.

But (weirdness) R-1.4.1 patched (compiled in exactly the
same way as R-devel on the same machine) uses 13.5
seconds for 500 and 115 seconds for 1000, i.e. only 30%
faster than Carbon, and more than twice as slow as the
official 1.4.1 and as R-devel.

Here is another quick and dirty benchmark I have used, one that uses no
ATLAS and no FORTRAN. Simply

system.time(sort(rnorm(10^n)))

where n is 6 or 7. Compare

Darwin 1.4.1, Darwin patched, Darwin devel, Carbon

for n=6 this gives 100, 105, 102, 138 (relative to 1.4.1 which takes 11 
secs)
for n=7 this gives 100, 111, 102, 135 (relative to 1.4.1 which takes 175 
secs)

The dual 1Ghz is 30% faster than the dual 800 Mhz here, and the Darwin
version is 30% faster than the Carbon version (and again something is
wrong with the R-1.4.1 patched I use).

Probably not -- in the old days when we only used the Level 1 BLAS there
seemed to be little performance gain from ATLAS on Linux or from the Sun

on G4s could help noticeably.

Hi all,

	Just a few comments from someone who does Altivec and performance
computing for a living:


>>  Cube 450 MHz G4:        341 sec.
>>  PM G4e 867 MHz:         234 sec.
>>  Compaq Alpha 666 MHz:   124 sec.
>>  Pentium 4 Xeon 1.7 GHz: 174 sec.
>>  Athlon 1.4 GHz/Win2000: 142 sec.
>>  IBM Power 3, 375 MHz:   194 sec. (single node of SP supercomputer)
>>  MIPS R14000, 500 MHz:   104 sec. (single node of Origin 3800

In this case, the 867 MHz performance is not scaling linearly with the
Cube performance. It should. When it doesn't that is usually an
indication that your code does not properly saturate the FPU pipelines.
The G4/867 has a 5 stage FPU, whereas the G4/450 has a 3 stage FPU.
Older compilers don't always schedule for this fact. Also some programs
are written as if the processor has a one stage pipeline, which can tie
the hands of even an educated compiler. Assuming the Cube results are
optimal, one should expect to get a time of about 177 sec with this code
if it scaled linearly. In my work, it is not surprising to see a factor
of two FPU performance improvement if you pay attention to pipelines.

If you are a member of Apple's select and Premier developer programs,
you might take a look at your code execution with Sim_G4. That will
document on an instruction by instruction basis where the inefficiency
is. Usually the problems are fairly straightforward to fix once you know
what they are.

Apple provides an AltiVec tuned BLAS library. Please see vBLAS.h in
vecLib.framework.

If it was me, I'd lobby for two FPU's instead. The vector register is
only 128 bytes wide. Two way parallelism is not enough to justify
adopting the overhead of a SIMD unit in my opinion. Also, with two FPU's
you can use existing code with no additional training. Where a vector
unit really shines is when parallelism is much higher -- 4, 8 or 16 way
parallelism.

One can actually write benchmark cases to show up to a four fold
improvement due to prefetching. 20-30% is much more common.

On the G4 FPU, single and double precision are equally expensive, except
for divide. In some cases, single precision is more expensive due to the
need to round double precision results back down to single precision.

Yes. You might find the materials here a good read:

	http://idisk.mac.com/simd/Public

Also, the Altivec Forum <altivec_forum@forum.altivec.org> is probably
one of the most sane, informative, generous and helpful mailing lists on
the internet.

Here again, the 867 results don't scale with the 400 results. You should
be seeing about 146 seconds.

"Properly done" you should in my experience see about a 3x speed
improvement with AltiVec over rigorously optimized, hand tuned scalar
FPU code. Ideally it should be 4x, but there is always some overhead to
deal with with real world problems, mostly to do with rearranging data
in register, handling alignment, loading constants, stack setup, etc.

Achieving a real world 3-4x performance improvement requires that you
learn something about vector programming thought patterns and a little
bit more about the processor. Altivec is a bit fussier than the scalar
units about data layout and data flow patterns. If you choose to ignore
that and continue to practice standard standard scalar programming
methods in the context of the vector unit, AltiVec can actually be
slower.

Please take a look at the website and tutorial reference above for
specifics. This is a much larger subject than I can cover here.

Here is the same thing as before, now done a bit more systematically. The
rather bad performance of R-patched on eigen is a mystery (to me), the 
gain
in La.eigen when using ATLAS is probably not Altivec, but using
threaded level 3 BLAS on a dual processor machine.

Hi,
	Two questions: 1) I've seen the speed advantages of Darwin over
Carbon R that Jan posted on a G4. Would these advantages be realized on a
G3 machine? 2) What would be the quickest/easiest set of steps necessary
to set up Darwin R on a G3 to realize these speed
improvements? I.e. what's the minimum I need? I've seen all kinds of
packages suggested, f2c, f77, atlas, etc. etc. I just want to get a basic 
R running as fast as possible. (I do mostly integer matrix algebra stuff).

Compare Carbon with the official R-1.4.1 which does not use ATLAS
and Altivec. You should see similar speed differences on a G3.

Downloading the compiled Darwin R-1.4.1 from CRAN is the fastest way to
install. See the README if you get complaints about missing
libraries.

Well, it's almost entirely in the algorithm used in LAPACK.  There is no
single precision used.  DSYEVR was designed as `the holy grail' for that
problem, and it uses level 3 BLAS much better than its predecessors.
I see an 8x speed up on my PIII Linux box on your tests (and the ATLAS
there is only using one processor to keep the build portable).

My guess (and only a guess) is that you have an alignment problem. I am
pretty sure there is no change in the internal code across the versions you
used, but some compilers and chips will run code much faster with certain
alignments than others. Sparc for example needs -dalign under it's native
compiler, and without that (which used to be necessary under S-PLUS) there
could be performance changes of this nature under very small code changes.

Ok, I've downloaded Darwin R-1.4.1 from Cran and extracted it. I see three
folders: bin, lib, and man. In the terminal I see the /bin dir on my
machine's startup drive, but I don't see a lib or a man. I'm guessing I
put the contents of the bin folder in /bin. What do I do with the others?

In tandem with Jean Thioulouse,

we are trying to "fill" the macos/contrib directory on CRAN in order to 
have the maximum number of available packages. So have a look 
periodically in that folder when you need some package for the Carbon 
version of R.

Jean will hopefully became the new "official" package maintainer for 
release 1.5 of R.

Hello, Everyone:
I downloaded a R for MacOSX(Darwin/X11). Everythin works well except the
help system. I wanted to show the help information in a browser and I knew
that the command "open" can be used to start the browser. However when I
tried to start browser in R, nothing happened. The command I used was:
system("open $HOME/.R/doc/html/index.html")
Is there anyone can give me some advices? Thanks.

What I've done is simply drag index.html to the doc.  Click the icon, and
the browser starts.

This doesn't open it from within R, but it gets the documentation up, and
I've found it very convenient.

To keep it from looking like just another web page in the doc, I downloaded
the R logo from CRAN and replaced the generic icon with the R logo. 

Hope this helps.

The problem is that there is currently no decent browser available for 
Darwin.
I have tried XMosaic, Dillo, Amaya, and Mozilla; but there are various
problems with each of them. So help.start() does not work. Opening a 
browser
on the Aqua desktop does not work either -- what does work is

system("dillo /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html &")

if you have dillo installed (on the X desktop).,

You can get dillo from fink.

What also works is opening your browser in aqua and then saying in R

system("open /Applications/WWW/OmniWeb.app 
/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html &")

Of course this should be used with rootless X11.

One simple way to get html help in R when you are running in rootless
mode, and you have your preferred aqua browser open, is to make a script

#!/bin/tcsh
open "/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html"

call it "netscape", make it executable, and put it in your path. In both
rooted and rootles mode you can use a script such as

#!/bin/tcsh
dillo /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html >& /dev/null &

if you have installed an X11 browser foo such as dillo or mozilla or 
amaya. Again
call the script netscape (or change the default browser name in R).

Hi,
	I've been using postscript() and ps2pdf to view plot outputs from
DarwinR (1.4.0)  using OS X's (10.1.3) terminal program. An example of the
commands I use are given below. I have found some odd behavior. If I do
the plot command below in DarwinX I get a plot with the "ns" axis on the
bottom and the "meanpl/maxvec" axis on the left. If I do the series of
commands below, then convert "plot1.ps" to "plot1.pdf" using ps2pdf, I
find that the 'ns' axis is on the left and the "meanpl/maxvec" axis is on
the top! If I change the horizontal flag to FALSE, the location of the
labels/axes stays the same, but the relative length of the axes
changes. Is there some other option I need to be invoking in order to get
the postscript/pdf output to match the graphical window output?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]making maps a la usa()
Message-ID: <2626A378-2B1E-11D6-90B5-000393057BBE@lbl.gov>

I need to make some maps, showing states in the U.S. with highlighting, 
superimposed bars of adjustable length and width, etc...the sort of 
thing one would use usa() for in S.  An archive search finds that there 
are some platform-specific ports, but not for OS X.

I'm not sure why this is a platform-specific issue, really: it seems 
like usa() (and related map functions) could be written using R's 
graphics functions, and I'm kinda surprised if that's not the way it was 
originally done.

Is there an R solution for this?

Thanks.

Phil,

if there is no source code to compile there is no platform issue at all.
Can you give me some coordinates of such ports for other platforms?
Stefano

ok,

I'll have a look at the archives in the meanwhile

Ok,

I have successfully built the source code of the maps library but the R 
code can't be used as it is under MacOS (no problems for Darwin R)

The R code is full of system() calls, actually not available under MacOS 
and all the file paths are specified in terms of "/" instead of using 
the file.path() R function.
Moreover, the system() calls are to typical Unix commands like awk, 
egrep etc.

So, as I have not enough time at moment to rewrite all the R code, I 
think this package can't be used with Carbon R at the moment.

If any other would like to the try to rewrite the code in a standard R 
fashion, I'll be pleased to collaborate.

Sorry,

		Stefano

In my previous msg I said that maps package should work without problems 
on Darwin R. I cannot provide it, but you can just follow Brian Ripley's 
instructions to build it. Move all the files in the src/proj dir into 
src/. Delete the make files and build it as usual using R CMD INSTALL 
maps from the shell.

good luck
