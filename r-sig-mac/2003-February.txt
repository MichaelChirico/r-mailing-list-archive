Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0302022041240.28373-100000@spline2.stat.wisc.edu>

Hello,
I have a data set with dates stored as a factor with levels coded as, for
example  "01/03/1996" 

I tried the following:

onset <- strptime(as.character(cf$dx.dt), format="%m%d%Y")

where cf$dx.dt are the dates in the data frame cf.  For output, I get NA
for every entry.  If it matters, I'm running the fink version of R 1.6.1
on a powerbook G4 with OS 10.2.2.  

I have little experience dealing with dates in R.  Is there a reference
that discusses the general issues?

Any help would be much appreciated. 
Thanks,
John

Try format="%m/%d/%Y"

The help pages are pretty good, and the examples in ?strptime show 
something quite similar to your case.

Vol. 1/2 of R News (available at the R website) has the article that 
introduced the POSIXt classes.

If the dates look like "01/03/1996" then the format is "%m/%d/%Y"

Message-ID: <F61821A2-3849-11D7-AD7D-00039376D51E@bio.umass.edu>

I am disturbed by the phenomenon that after a large amount of R work on 
my Mac I become incommunicado via my Email client.  Email sometimes 
does not connect to a functional and sometimes its window will not 
appear when prompted.  Restarting the Mac fixes communication.  It is 
only after I have done considerable R programming. I have a Ti80 with 
512Mb memory running OsX 10.2.3 and having installed the Jan de Leeuw 
Jan 22 packages.

It might be associated with R script failures (i.e. my errors during 
script development) particularly, although I have not examined this 
systematically.  Have any other Mac R users experienced this 
phenomenon.  Are there memory leak issues associated with R or R script 
failures?

What version of R are you using?  I believe there was a memory leak
discovered in R 1.6.0.

Message-ID: <p05200f00ba69812edcd1@[128.115.153.6]>

Yesterday, with some help from David James, I managed to install the 
ROracle package. OS X 10.2.3.

The server is Oracle 8i running on a Sun Solaris box.
The client has Oracle 9i (files only, no database created, no Oracle 
processes running).

In a single test with a very simple query, it works.

This version of R was installed from Jan's gifi, not from CRAN source code.

There were a couple of strange things having to do with the Oracle 
distribution that I had to work around.

Sefano, here is a better description of what I had to do to get 
ROracle to install.

David, I posted a note on r-sig-mac that I had done this, and Stefano 
asked for more information. So here it is.

-Don

------- ROracle ------
In the Makefile.in in ROracle/src, change
   PARSE = FULL
to
   PARSE = PARTIAL
This is a directive to proc, the Oracle ProC/C++ precompiler

Thanks to David James, ROracle's maintainer (and one of the authors) 
for this information.

------- Oracle -------
I downloaded the "Oracle9i Database Developer's Release for Apple Mac 
OS X Version 10.2 (Jaguar)" from Oracle's "Oracle Technology 
Network." It's a little hard to find, have to look under "Oracle9i 
JDeveloper Download".

Install according to instructions from Oracle. This puts it in 
/Users/oracle/9iR2/orahome.

Create appropriate tnsnames.ora and listener.ora files in 
$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin.

The first work around is this:

cp  $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/lib/libclntst9.a $ORACLE_HOME/lib
cd $ORACLE_HOME/lib
ranlib -s libclntst9.a

(look in the file $ORACLE_HOME/precomp/lib/env_precomp.mk for 
references to libclntst9.a)

The absence of libclntst9.a in $ORACLE_HOME/lib may represent an 
error in the Oracle distribution, or it may represent a lack of 
understanding on my part.

The second work around is truly puzzling. It may be due to something 
I did without realizing the side effect, so don't assume this work 
around will be necessary.

I installed Oracle here:
    [662]% echo $ORACLE_HOME
    /Users/oracle/9iR2/orahome
but for some unknown reason Oracle's proc behaved as if ORACLE_HOME is here:
    /Users/oracle/Source/9iR2

I worked around this by first creating the directory 
/Users/oracle/Source and then making a soft link:
   [663]% cd /Users/oracle/Source
   [664]% ls -l
   total 8
   drwxr-xr-x   3 macq    ora  102 Feb  6 16:16 ./
   drwxrwxr-x  19 oracle  ora  646 Feb  6 16:11 ../
   lrwxr-xr-x   1 macq    ora   15 Feb  6 16:16 9iR2@ -> ../9iR2/orahome

----- Environment variables -----
Then, before attempting to install ROracle, set some environment 
variables. Here is the script I use (csh syntax). The value of 
ORACLE_SID is probably wrong, but I haven't seen any problems from it 
yet.

-----------------------------
# This is your ORACLE_HOME
setenv S /Users/oracle/9iR2/orahome

# Root of All Oracle installation.
setenv ORACLE_HOME $S
# Same as ORACLE_HOME
setenv SRCHOME $S
# Add Oracle binaries to path.
setenv PATH $S/bin:$PATH
# Oracle SID
setenv ORACLE_SID ab
# setenv CDEBUG "-g -O0"
# Required to find dynamic libraries.
if ( $?DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ) then
     setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $S/lib:$S/rdbms/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
else
     setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $S/lib:$S/rdbms/lib
endif

# Required for the database application.
if ($?CLASSPATH) then
     setenv CLASSPATH $S/DBCreate/oradev/classes/orapts.jar:$CLASSPATH
else
     setenv CLASSPATH $S/DBCreate/oradev/classes/orapts.jar
endif

# Required for JDBC connection
setenv CLASSPATH $S/jdbc/lib/classes12.zip:$CLASSPATH

R-1.6.2 is updated to use the newest CRAN packages and the newest fink
libraries. It is actually R-patched of 02-10-03. I am not distributing 
separate
fink libraries any more, you have to build your own, and get Apple's 
X11 (this uses version 0.2). There are now 295 R package binaries 
included.

MacPython-2.3a is updated from CVS, with updated versions of PyObjc,
Numeric, Numarray, wxPython, and now also with PyOpenGL and PYRO.

Ruby-1.8.0 is updated from CVS, and it contains the newest version of
RubyCocoa.

MacPython on http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub has been upgraded to include
pyMPI, PYRO, PyOpenGL, PyOrbit, and PyGTK. This makes it more
comparable with R and its many packages, and because Rpy is
included you can really mix and match now.

Next week I will post a new version of R, which fixes a slight 
incompatibility
with wxPython (currently you cannot load Rpy into pycrust or pyshell or 
PythonCard),
and an even bigger version of Python with PythonCard included (as well
as OmniORBpy, and a fixed version of numarray).

As others may hit the same issues, I am posting a few comments
on points re Apple's X11, which is indeed a great piece of
software, even as currently advertised in beta mode.
I am using the public beta (0.2.1) that became available on Feb 12,
with SDK installed also.

In part, I am posting this in the hope that others will have light
to shed on these setup issues.

(1) Fink users may find that, before installing Apple's X11, it may pay
to read an up-to-date version of Section 3.2 of the document at
   http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/inst-xfree86.php
Currently, this advises users to delete existing xfree86 packages
before proceeding.  I am not sure how necessary this is;  Apple's
X11 will work even if this is not done, but some fink-based
software may not?

(2) There are useful hints in

   http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1232.html

Anyone who uses a beta version is a developer, right?
Well, this was a point that dawned on me only after a fair
amount of searching in less appropriate places for help.

(3) Apple's X11 ignores /etc/csh.login
Source /sw/bin/init.sh (not /sw/bin/init.csh, even though you get,
finally, a tcsh shell).  I used my .tcshrc for this purpose.
(probably .cshrc is also ok)
[Under the fink XFree86 implementation of X11, /etc/csh.login
was a good place to source /sw/bin/init.sh, and a good place
(on a single user machine) in which to set paths.  Setting them
in a .cshrc or .tcshrc under  had the slightly disastrous effect of
duplicating relevant bits of the path every time that a new xterm
window was opened!]

(4) [Actually, when I sourced /sw/bin/init.sh, I had an error:
Bad : modifier in $ (/).
I backed up /sw/bin/init.sh and copied /sw/bin/init.csh to
/sw/bin/init.csh, and all was well.  It may just have been that my
/sw/bin/init.sh was corrupt.]

(5) For setting up a .xinitrc file, copy the version that it at
/etc/X11R6/xinit/xinitrc to .xinitrc into the home directory and
modify that.  At all events, I found that, on my system, this is
what I had to do.  Such an .xinitrc can be used to start additional
xterms, or to invoke a different window manager.
[Document qa1232.html noted above says /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc,
but that is surely a mistake.]

(6) qa1232.html describes how to activate the selection
proxying features (copy & paste) of quartz-wm, while using another
window manager.  I have yet to experiment with this.  [I rather
like icewm, because it is simple, and gives up to 4 desktops.]

(7) After attending to these other matters, getting emacs, ess and
R set up is a breeze!

If you use fink and Apple's X11 together, then fink will get confused,  
because you
may have installed something using Apple's version and fink has no way  
of knowing
it's library etc has been replaced. So you install fink's  
system-xfree86 and remove
fink's xfree86.

Anyone who compiles anything is a developer, because
you need the developer tools, and you can only get these
by becoming a (free) member of the ADC.

On OS X csh is just tcsh (same as sh is just bash)

I don't see that happening. And I do source /sw/bin/init.sh in
.tchsrc.

Did you source init.sh (a bash shell script) from tcshrc ?

No, that is a link added in 0.2.

Note that the fink document is about version 0.1, not about 0.2,
Gnome/KDE hints, for instance, have been fixed.

But the instructions on replacing fink's X11 by Apple's are
very useful, and I recommend everybody to actually do this.

For our student labs we now run R in an xterm, using
a script and iHook (http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/ihook/)
to start things up. Looks like a Cocoa application allright.

Hello Jan -
Probably I should have contacted you earlier. I did however learn

I figured that was probably what was happening.  First time round,
I did though install Apple's X11, unthinkingly, without checking 
the fink documentation.

So that is what I signed up to!

At all events, this is not the behaviour under Apple's X11.

Yes, I did, after earlier trying putting it into .xinitrc.
Sourcing the file as init.csh, whether from .xinitrc or from .tcshrc, 
had no effect on the path.  Is there another, more appropriate, place
for this?  It was a question of where to go to next when I found that
following the Fink document and putting . /sw/bin/init.sh as the 
third line in my .xinitrc did not do the trick.

I see now that I do have that link in my installation.  Earlier,
I had been unable to find it, perhaps because my .xinitrc was
incomplete?

Hi,
	I am trying to install a package I created myself using the R CMD 
INSTALL command. I have successfully installed other packages using 
this command (in .tar.gz format). My own package is not gzipped, but 
when I "sudo R CMD INSTALL /my/path/mypackage" it seems to install 
perfectly well, and indeed when I run R (I'm using OS X 10.2.4, btw) 
and do "library()" it lists my package along with all the others. I can 
even "library(help=daver)" to see the description and index files for 
my package. BUT, when I "library(daver)" to load the package, I get the 
following error:

Error: package daver was built for NA
In addition: Warning message:
package daver was built under R version 02-12-27

and it doesn't see any of my functions.

I believe that my package has all the required elements, description, 
index, title, and an R folder with the source code in it. Why does my 
package not work, have I missed something?

Dave R.

I have

Built: 2002-12-27

I was under the impression that the "built" field requires a date, but 
perhaps it is asking for the version of R under which the package was 
compiled?

The update of the macpython-2.3a archive now includes 
/Applications/wxPythonOSX-2.4.0.2, with an application bundle for 
pyShell. It also include wxWindowsMac.

The framework Python build contains Numeric, numarray, Rpy (0.3.1), 
wxPython,
pyObjc, pygtk.

One nice thing about this is that the following sequence actually works 
(both from
pyShell and from PythonIDE)

 >>> from rpy import *
 >>> x=r.seq(100)
 >>> y=r.rnorm(100)
 >>> r.quartz()
 >>> r.plot(x,y)

It produces a scatterplot in the quartz device window that actually 
responds
to events, i.e. can be brought to the foreground and so on. And you can 
run

 >>> r.demo("graphics")

Another nice thing, of course, is that you can do wxWindows and Cocoa 
Programming and
R from the same pyShell or PythonIDE window, and every other thing 
Python.

One thing you should NOT do is to try pygtk or the R tcltk package, 
because they
still need X11.

My next step is to incorporate PythonCard and build a version of 
libR.dylib that
uses tkAqua (Python already uses tkAqua). I'll remove pygtk, until it 
can be
compiled with the native Carbon gtk.

By the way, the IDLE in /Applications/MacPython-2.3a currently does not 
work.

The combined application you have is, of course, a compromise. It has 
quite
a few things (LAPACK, tcl/tk, basic functionality) both on the R and 
the Python side,
which is wasteful. The Carbon stuff in Python seems sort of slow. And 
Rpy
is no speed daemon either.

The update of the macpython-2.3a archive now includes
/Applications/<fontfamily><param>Lucida Grande</param>wxPythonOSX-2.4.0.2</fontfamily>,
with an application bundle for pyShell. It also include wxWindowsMac.


The framework Python build contains Numeric, numarray, Rpy (0.3.1),
wxPython, 

pyObjc, pygtk. 


One nice thing about this is that the following sequence actually
works (both from

pyShell and from PythonIDE)


>>> from rpy import *

>>> x=r.seq(100)

>>> y=r.rnorm(100)

>>> r.quartz()

>>> r.plot(x,y)


It produces a scatterplot in the quartz device window that actually
responds

to events, i.e. can be brought to the foreground and so on. And you
can run


>>> r.demo("graphics")


Another nice thing, of course, is that you can do wxWindows and Cocoa
Programming and

R from the same pyShell or PythonIDE window, and every other thing
Python.


One thing you should NOT do is to try pygtk or the R tcltk package,
because they

still need X11. 


My next step is to incorporate PythonCard and build a version of
libR.dylib that

uses tkAqua (Python already uses tkAqua). I'll remove pygtk, until it
can be

compiled with the native Carbon gtk.


By the way, the IDLE in /Applications/MacPython-2.3a currently does
not work.

One way to check which dynamic libraries you need if you download
an R binary is to run "otool -L" on all executables. i.e. on R.bin
and all foo.so bundles. Another way to find out which libraries
dyld is actually loading at run time is to do

setenv DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES 1

and then start R. Then dyld will tell you which libraries it is loading.

Message-ID: <2E32EFD1-48D9-11D7-9FA5-0030657C49C2@cox.net>

Hello,

I am trying to adapt code for use in R 1.6 on a Mac in OS 10.2.  The 
program uses 'win.graph' to set plot size. What is the Mac equivalent? 
I have searched where I can but no luck. Any help would be appreciated.

Here is a snip of code where this is implemented.:

if (Gr.Avg)
	{
		if (Gr.Orient == 1)  win.graph(width=8.5, height=11)
			else  win.graph(width=11, height=8.5)
		par(mfrow=c(Gr.Rows, Gr.Cols), omi=c(.5,.5,.5,.5))

		X.Values <- Curves[[1]][,1]
		X.Range <- c(min(X.Values), max(X.Values))

		Y.Values <- rep(0,length(X.Values))
		for (i in 1:length(Curve.Info[,1]))
			Y.Values <- Y.Values + Curves[[i]][,2]
		Y.Values <- Y.Values / length(Curve.Info[,1])
		Y.Range <- c(min(Y.Values), max(Y.Values))

		P.Avg <- 1/((Y.Values[length(Y.Values)]/Y.Values[1]) + 1)
		if (P.Avg < 0) P.Avg <- 0  # correct for possibilities of negative 
values at extremes
		if (P.Avg > 1) P.Avg <- 1

		plot(X.Values, Y.Values, type = "p", pch = 16, ylim = Y.Range, xlim = 
X.Range,
		     ylab = "Mean Difference", xlab = "Input")
		lines(X.Values, Y.Values)  # solid line for raw data only
		mtext(paste("MAMBAC AVG CURVE, ",Data.Label),outer=T)
	}
	return(P.Avg)

I don't have this. What this says is that the modules in libg2c.a have  
not been
compiled with -fno-common., which indicates there is something wrong  
with
your g77 from fink. Make sure you have the latest OS 10.2 version. In  
any case
use the g77 from the unstable tree, and try "fink rebuild g77"

Hi,
can anyone help me with the following problem?

[Using R-1.6.2 patched on Mac OS X 10.2.4, Developer tools from ~August?]

I have made four personal R libaries on Linux, and I'm trying to get
them to work on Mac OS X.  All of them have C code that is called from
R using .C().  Three out of the four work fine, but when I try to
compile one of them (a Voronoi library, based on Steve Fortune's code)
ld complains.

ld produces many similar complaints, before the build fails.

Has anyone else come across this problem? The package builds fine on
my linux box.

Thanks for any pointers,

If you use flat namespaces you cannot have multiple definitions of  
symbols,
because the linked application has no way of knowing which definition
you meant. There are a number of ways to deal with this. You can use
two-level namespaces (which give warnings for multiple definitions)

You can change the C code such that all definitions but one use extern  
(this is best). And you can force the link by adding the
-m flag, which also transforms errors to warnings, i.e.

Thanks very much Jan for your help.  I have updated the C code so that
the global variables are defined once, and then "extern"ed in other
files that need them.  This works very well.

Message-ID: <EE913B7F-49F9-11D7-9DCB-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

You need

(a) a recent OS X framework build of python, which also installs IDLE
(b) a recent OS X framework build  of AquaTk (i.e. native Tcl/Tk)
(c) a version of R compiled with AquaTk and without X11
(d) a recent version of Rpy

Now you can open IDLE and say

 >> from rpy import *
 >> r.quartz()
 >> r.library("tcltk")
 >> r.demo("tkdensity")

This all works. You get the Aqua Tk widgets and the plotting in the
quartz device. Windows can be brought to the foreground, minimized to  
the
dock, and widgets can be operated with the mouse. No X11 is required
at all.

Hello,

I recently installed R on my new PowerBook G4 moving from the Windows
world. In that world, I was a fairly competent user. However there are two
things about the Mac implementation that I can not figure out. Stefano has
already tried to answer one of my questions. However, it did not work or I
did not understand. Here are the questions:

1) When I try to change the directory and read in data using the
load("filename.Rda") command, I keep getting the following error message:

>load("filename.Rda")

Error: bad restore file magic number (file may be corrupted)-- no data
loaded.

All this is is a simple text file. I have tried changing the directory
every which way, changing the extension etc but I can not read data in and
I keep getting that error message.

What do I need to do? This is very frustrating for such a simple
operation.

2) The next question is how does one install a package that is not on the
CRAN website? I downloaded the Simple package but do not know how to get
it working. Dragging it in to the R folder does not seem to do it.

Thanks very much and thanks for the port to Mac OS X.

Rick, try to read the help files. If it is a simple txt file, then you 
should use read.table instead.
There are a couple of good intros written by R-core members like:
* An introduction to R
* R Data Import/Export
you can find both inside the doc folder of you installation of R or 
(better) on the www.r-project.org site in the "Manuals" section

If packages does not contain C/Fortran code, then you can use any 
prebuilt version of it (either Windows or Unix)
You cannot use packages as they are beacusa they need to be built.
If you want to build packages on your own, have a look inside the R 
sources in the file INSTALL of the src/macintosh directory.

The "true" MacOSX version of R is the Darwin/R and not the Carbon one 
you are using. The Carbon version of R will be soon abandoned and fully 
replaced by the Darwin one.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]R plus Python
Message-ID: <4CAF1071-4B54-11D7-926F-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

Later today the file python_plus_R.tar.gz will appear on
http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub.

It contains R-1.6.2 (patched) with binaries for 200-300
packages. It also includes the fink dynamic libs needed
for running R.bin (these are installed in /sw/lib).

Second, it contains a Python framework build,
that comes with PyObjc, PyOpenGL,
Numeric, numarray, PyPostgres, PYRO, PythonCardPrototype,
wxPython, and, most importantly, Rpy. Thus you can
program in Cocoa, OpenGL, wxWindows, and R from this
python.

Third, it has the Tcl and Tk native framework builds (used both
in tkinter and R).

In /Applications it installs a MacPython-2.3 and a wxPythonOSX-2.4.0.2
folder, which contain various front ends. For instance, there is
IDLE (useful for tkinter programming) and PyShell (useful for wxWindows
programming).

In /usr/local/bin you find the python, pythonw, pyshell, pycrust,  
codeEditor,
and resourceEditor scripts (the first two are from the Python distro,
the next two from wxPython, the last two from PythonCard). Of course
you can still run R from the command line (Terminal.app) if you want
to.

If you open IDLE, or PyCrust, or PythonIDE, you can say

 >>>import * from rpy
 >>>r.quartz()
 >>>r.demo("graphics")

and things should roll along. No X11 server required !

In IDLE you can even say, in addition to the stuff above,

 >>>r.library("tcltk")
 >>>r.demo("tkcanvas")

Still no X11 required.

If you start python from the command line (using the
pythonw script), you can give the same sequence of
commands, but then you will use the X11 graphics
device (and the X11 version of tk). Plenty of choices.

Of course the nice thing is that you can combine R programming
with Cocoa programming or wxWindows programming, and you can
write python scripts that use python versions of R, numarray,
and OpenGL commands.

You can even run

 >>>r.update_packages()

from the Python GUI's.
