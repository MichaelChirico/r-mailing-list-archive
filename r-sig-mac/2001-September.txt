Version 1.3.1 of R(s) for MacOS have been released.

They will be mirrored starting from tomorrow at CRAN.

For the Carbon version (MacOS 8.6 to 9.2 and OSX) refer to

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/rm131

and for the Darwin/X11 version refer to

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/rx131

(this last was already announced by Jan de Leeuw and now mirrored at 
CRAN).


Stefano M. Iacus

What follows are specific changes to Carbon R.

rm131
=====
* Added the "Config" menu
* Fixed a bug in the lapack module. Complex functions are now
   available.
* Added MPW makefiles to build standard libraries and modules
* Added experimental script to build R via Apple's MRC compiler
* Now R needs a new shared library "f2c" lib that will increase
   portability for all fortran based packages
* Added support for apple events. R begins to be a scriptable
   application. Very limited support by now but will increase soon.
   Some demo scripts have been added.
* link.html.help() function has been added by picking windows code.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]parallel distributed computing in R
Message-ID: <200109040103.SAA64660@pine.frazmtn.com>

Li and Rossini recently published the RPVM package, an interface
in R to the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine). PVM makes it
possible, in fact rather easy, to write programs that run
their tasks on multiple machines (such as a Beowulf or our G4
cluster, but heterogeneous machines are also possible). The
RPVM package allows you to run PVM commands from R, i.e.
to distribute (computationally intensive) R tasks over multiple
machines (and to provide an R interface to legacy PVM programs).

I am happy to report that PVM and XPVM (a tcl/tk GUI for PVM),
and RPVM all compile without problems on Darwin.

You can get a compiled version of PVM 3.4 for Darwin at

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pvm3.tar.gz

This includes xpvm. Install it, say in $HOME, and define

setenv PVM_ROOT {$HOME}/pvm3
setenv XPVM_ROOT {$PVM_ROOT}/xpvm
setenv PVM_ARCH DARWIN

then install.packages("rpvm") in R, and you're
ready to fly. Of course the whole thing only becomes
interesting if you have access to other machines
running PVM.

The 'macos' CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos) directory has 
been updated with packages re-built for release 1.3.1 of Carbon R. See 
bin/macos/contrib

Each achive contains a 'src' dir with both MPW makefiles and CodeWarrior 
project files that can be used to build the packages.

Packages that do not need a recompile at release time have been moved to 
the
bin/macos/contrib/anyR folder

Packages built for a specific version of R (say, R-x.y.z) are now in

bin/macos/contrib/rmxyz

CRAN will be updated starting from Sep 7th 2001.

Message-ID: <3EFEF7D83ABED411937D00508BCFE3FC020915FD@DASMTHEFL800>

I installed the precompiled 1.3.1 binaries (the full Mac OS X package with tcl/tk and gnome support) after obtaining tcltk8.x and the gnome packages via fink.  However, trying to run R with the command R --gui=gnome results in an error stating that this version doesn't support Gnome.

I'm also having problems getting tcl/tk to work.  When I give the command library(tcltk) from the R command line, I get an error stating that tcltk can't be found (and a number of standard directories are listed).  I did declare TCL_LIBRARY in my .tcshrc and pointed it to the /sw/fink/src/tk directory...

Can anyone give me some pointers on what I'm doing wrong?

R-1.3.1 no longer supports gnome, that will probably come back in 1.4.0, 
because
the R team now found a maintainer. If you need gnome support, you can 
find it in my private builds of R-patched and R-devel, which are in

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R

I think TCL_LIBRARY should point to /sw/lib, but better just unsetenv it.

If you want to do this, you have to replace

-bundle -undefined suppress

in the configure files by

-bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress

(use config.site, for instance). It's probably not a bad idea to rebuild
ATLAS as well.

Hi,
	I'm using the carbon version of R (on sys 8.6) and want to install
packages (and also learn how to get R to recognize functions I write
myself). In UNIX/osX there is "R CMD INSTALL..." but there seems to be no
analogous command for the classic os. I'm guessing I'm going to have to
manually put the directories in the right places. I can untar/ungzip the
package I want to install, but don't know where to put the dirs. Any help
on how to install R packages in the carbon version (running on 8.6) of R
would be greatly appreciated.

You should download the packaes from CRAN in the bin/macos/contrib dir.
Just uncompress them and move to the library directory.

It is explained in the ReadMe file in the same directory at cran.

If you use XTools, the commercial X server from Tenon (www.tenon.com),
then you can choose between rootless and full-screen mode, and in
either mode you can choose the Aqua window manager. Rootless
mode, for those who do not know the terminology, means that you
Aqua desktop remains intact and X11 applications run in windows
onn the Aqua desktop. For instance, you can run an xterm window
and start R in there. Or you can run "R --gui=gnome", which will
also create a window with menus and buttons on your desktop. In
full-screen mode the X server takes over the desktop and you have
to switch between desktops to use either Aqua or X11. Many people
think rootless is nicer, but it can more easily lead to window clutter
and possibly to some confusion (where am I ?).

There is now also a free Aqua window manager than runs with Xfree86,
the open source X server. Here you also have rootless and full-screen
mode, and there are many window managers available. If you are
working in rootless mode on the Aqua desktop, then it makes sense to
use Aqua windows for X11 as well. The OroborusX window manager,
downloadable from http://wrench.et.ic.ac.uk/adrian/software/oroborosx/,
does this very well. Adrian Umpleby, who is doing this, has plans to
make X clients into double clickable applications under OS X,
which will make the integration of the two environments even more
seamless.

By the way, neither XTools nor XFree86 run unmodified under MacOS X
10.1. XTools will be upgraded as soon as 10.1 is official (next week),
in XDarwin you must set the "Load from file" flag in the keymapping
section of the preferences -- then everything works fine.

which will make the integration of the two environments even more

seamless.


By the way, neither XTools nor XFree86 run unmodified under MacOS X

10.1. XTools will be upgraded as soon as 10.1 is official (next week),

in XDarwin you must set the "Load from file" flag in the keymapping

section of the preferences -- then everything works fine.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]compiling & using ATLAS with Darwin R
Message-ID: <20010918133156.B7668@chanane.ucsf.edu>

I sucessfully compiled ATLAS using the default gcc
under OS X, but the FORTRAN part of the library wouldn't
build using f2c, and the R build chokes because it needs FORTRAN
stuff from ATLAS. I noticed that Jan mentions that the ATLAS
libraries have been compiled for OS X but failed to find them
on his site. Are these available somewhere?

I assume this would be easier if the OS X gcc implementation
included g77...

Thanks,

-Steve

If you get f2c and g77 and ATLAS from fink.sourceforge.net you will
have no problems building this.

You may still have problems loading, for example, the matrix
package, because this seems to be not quite compatible with the
more recent versions of ATLAS.

The R-full package on CRAN maybe too old. Try the one in

which also has updated packages and patches.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]getting round the absence of system() on R for Mac
Message-ID: <B7D4B50A.26B9%jefferis@stanford.edu>

Dear All,

I am analysing a set of 200 files describing the 3D structure of neurons.
One of the ways I would like to analyse these 3D data points is to find the
convex hull for each neuron.  I have an external compiled C application
which does that - at the moment it reads in a set of data stored in the file
chull.in and outputs the convex hull description to another outfile,
chull.out

I would like to write a routine in R which iterates over my 200 neurons,
replaces chull.in with the points describing the current neuron, runs chull,
read the contents of chull.out into R and update the current neuron object.
I can do everything except call this external program - under unix one would
use system().  Any suggestions?

Many thanks,

Greg.

P.S. I am using R v 1.3.1 on MacOS 9.1

Using/installing the OS X version of R can run into problems because
you do not have on your system all the necessary versions (or not the 
correct versions)
of the various dynamic libraries used in the build. I have put files

R.bin.txt
modules.txt
packages.txt

with the output of "otools -L" in http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/dylibs. 
This
show precisely which dylibs are needed.

system() is not implemented (yet, it would be possible in the next 
version but only running under OSX) in R.  You can try to use 
applescript to interact with other applications.
within R you can run applescript or, from an applescript you can ask R 
to execute commands. See the examples in the script directory.
As I'm trying to develop applescript support in R it would be nice if 
any of you reading the list suggest me what they would like to do in 
this direction.

Greg,

I'll check this later but you can use the following

applescript("",":RunChullProgram")

that should work.

I also invite you and other R users to develop some examples like yours 
to distribute along with the R binaries.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.20.0109291844090.9879-100000@jade.saintmarys.edu>

to allocate 7.8 MB to a vector? (on R running on MacOS 8.6 with a 100MB
partition)

I get this error from a function which is trying to create a 1000x1000
matrix:

Error: cannot allocate vector of size 7812 Kb

the error occurs here:
dist <- as.single((t(pos)-pos)/n)

where pos is a matrix of integers, and n is the size of the first
dimension. It appears to first create a double with (t(pos)-pos)/n,
running out of memory before making it a single.

Several questions arise from this problem: 1) how do I determine how much
memory is free within the program?, 2) how do I determine how much memory
is being consumed by a given object?, 3) how do I force R to create a
matrix as a single rather than a double?

David,

to check ow much memory R is using just go to the first finder menu, firt item, and you'll have an idea of what is going on.

R itslef needs somthing like 40Mb to run. If you want to use large data you shoud assign memory to R before stanting it. To do get the information on R application (from Finder: select R icon and press Command+I). Try to assing R more memory than it standard settings.

In case you need a very big amount of memory enable the virtual memory (from Control Panels/Memory) and assign R a huge amount of memory.

To see how fast R eats memory try to leave the Finder Info window open, run R and try to allocate your 1000^2 array...

The rest of your questions are not Macintosh specific so other R lists will be more helpful

Stefano

Stefano M. Iacus

What follows are specific changes to Carbon R.

rm131
=====
* Added the "Config" menu
* Fixed a bug in the lapack module. Complex functions are now
   available.
* Added MPW makefiles to build standard libraries and modules
* Added experimental script to build R via Apple's MRC compiler
* Now R needs a new shared library "f2c" lib that will increase
   portability for all fortran based packages
* Added support for apple events. R begins to be a scriptable
   application. Very limited support by now but will increase soon.
   Some demo scripts have been added.
* link.html.help() function has been added by picking windows code.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]parallel distributed computing in R
Message-ID: <200109040103.SAA64660@pine.frazmtn.com>

Li and Rossini recently published the RPVM package, an interface
in R to the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine). PVM makes it
possible, in fact rather easy, to write programs that run
their tasks on multiple machines (such as a Beowulf or our G4
cluster, but heterogeneous machines are also possible). The
RPVM package allows you to run PVM commands from R, i.e.
to distribute (computationally intensive) R tasks over multiple
machines (and to provide an R interface to legacy PVM programs).

I am happy to report that PVM and XPVM (a tcl/tk GUI for PVM),
and RPVM all compile without problems on Darwin.

You can get a compiled version of PVM 3.4 for Darwin at

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pvm3.tar.gz

This includes xpvm. Install it, say in $HOME, and define

setenv PVM_ROOT {$HOME}/pvm3
setenv XPVM_ROOT {$PVM_ROOT}/xpvm
setenv PVM_ARCH DARWIN

then install.packages("rpvm") in R, and you're
ready to fly. Of course the whole thing only becomes
interesting if you have access to other machines
running PVM.

I installed the precompiled 1.3.1 binaries (the full Mac OS X package with tcl/tk and gnome support) after obtaining tcltk8.x and the gnome packages via fink.  However, trying to run R with the command R --gui=gnome results in an error stating that this version doesn't support Gnome.

I'm also having problems getting tcl/tk to work.  When I give the command library(tcltk) from the R command line, I get an error stating that tcltk can't be found (and a number of standard directories are listed).  I did declare TCL_LIBRARY in my .tcshrc and pointed it to the /sw/fink/src/tk directory...

Can anyone give me some pointers on what I'm doing wrong?

R-1.3.1 no longer supports gnome, that will probably come back in 1.4.0, 
because
the R team now found a maintainer. If you need gnome support, you can 
find it in my private builds of R-patched and R-devel, which are in

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R

I think TCL_LIBRARY should point to /sw/lib, but better just unsetenv it.

If you want to do this, you have to replace

-bundle -undefined suppress

in the configure files by

-bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress

(use config.site, for instance). It's probably not a bad idea to rebuild
ATLAS as well.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.20.0109132104160.25232-100000@jade.saintmarys.edu>

Hi,
	I'm using the carbon version of R (on sys 8.6) and want to install
packages (and also learn how to get R to recognize functions I write
myself). In UNIX/osX there is "R CMD INSTALL..." but there seems to be no
analogous command for the classic os. I'm guessing I'm going to have to
manually put the directories in the right places. I can untar/ungzip the
package I want to install, but don't know where to put the dirs. Any help
on how to install R packages in the carbon version (running on 8.6) of R
would be greatly appreciated.

You should download the packaes from CRAN in the bin/macos/contrib dir.
Just uncompress them and move to the library directory.

It is explained in the ReadMe file in the same directory at cran.

If you use XTools, the commercial X server from Tenon (www.tenon.com),
then you can choose between rootless and full-screen mode, and in
either mode you can choose the Aqua window manager. Rootless
mode, for those who do not know the terminology, means that you
Aqua desktop remains intact and X11 applications run in windows
onn the Aqua desktop. For instance, you can run an xterm window
and start R in there. Or you can run "R --gui=gnome", which will
also create a window with menus and buttons on your desktop. In
full-screen mode the X server takes over the desktop and you have
to switch between desktops to use either Aqua or X11. Many people
think rootless is nicer, but it can more easily lead to window clutter
and possibly to some confusion (where am I ?).

There is now also a free Aqua window manager than runs with Xfree86,
the open source X server. Here you also have rootless and full-screen
mode, and there are many window managers available. If you are
working in rootless mode on the Aqua desktop, then it makes sense to
use Aqua windows for X11 as well. The OroborusX window manager,
downloadable from http://wrench.et.ic.ac.uk/adrian/software/oroborosx/,
does this very well. Adrian Umpleby, who is doing this, has plans to
make X clients into double clickable applications under OS X,
which will make the integration of the two environments even more
seamless.

By the way, neither XTools nor XFree86 run unmodified under MacOS X
10.1. XTools will be upgraded as soon as 10.1 is official (next week),
in XDarwin you must set the "Load from file" flag in the keymapping
section of the preferences -- then everything works fine.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]compiling & using ATLAS with Darwin R
Message-ID: <20010918133156.B7668@chanane.ucsf.edu>

I sucessfully compiled ATLAS using the default gcc
under OS X, but the FORTRAN part of the library wouldn't
build using f2c, and the R build chokes because it needs FORTRAN
stuff from ATLAS. I noticed that Jan mentions that the ATLAS
libraries have been compiled for OS X but failed to find them
on his site. Are these available somewhere?

I assume this would be easier if the OS X gcc implementation
included g77...

Thanks,

If you get f2c and g77 and ATLAS from fink.sourceforge.net you will
have no problems building this.

You may still have problems loading, for example, the matrix
package, because this seems to be not quite compatible with the
more recent versions of ATLAS.

The R-full package on CRAN maybe too old. Try the one in

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/builds

which also has updated packages and patches.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]getting round the absence of system() on R for Mac
Message-ID: <B7D4B50A.26B9%jefferis@stanford.edu>

Dear All,

I am analysing a set of 200 files describing the 3D structure of neurons.
One of the ways I would like to analyse these 3D data points is to find the
convex hull for each neuron.  I have an external compiled C application
which does that - at the moment it reads in a set of data stored in the file
chull.in and outputs the convex hull description to another outfile,
chull.out

I would like to write a routine in R which iterates over my 200 neurons,
replaces chull.in with the points describing the current neuron, runs chull,
read the contents of chull.out into R and update the current neuron object.
I can do everything except call this external program - under unix one would
use system().  Any suggestions?

Many thanks,

Greg.

P.S. I am using R v 1.3.1 on MacOS 9.1

Using/installing the OS X version of R can run into problems because
you do not have on your system all the necessary versions (or not the 
correct versions)
of the various dynamic libraries used in the build. I have put files

R.bin.txt
modules.txt
packages.txt

with the output of "otools -L" in http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/dylibs. 
This
show precisely which dylibs are needed.

system() is not implemented (yet, it would be possible in the next 
version but only running under OSX) in R.  You can try to use 
applescript to interact with other applications.
within R you can run applescript or, from an applescript you can ask R 
to execute commands. See the examples in the script directory.
As I'm trying to develop applescript support in R it would be nice if 
any of you reading the list suggest me what they would like to do in 
this direction.

Greg,

I'll check this later but you can use the following

applescript("",":RunChullProgram")

that should work.

I also invite you and other R users to develop some examples like yours 
to distribute along with the R binaries.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.20.0109291844090.9879-100000@jade.saintmarys.edu>

to allocate 7.8 MB to a vector? (on R running on MacOS 8.6 with a 100MB
partition)

I get this error from a function which is trying to create a 1000x1000
matrix:

Error: cannot allocate vector of size 7812 Kb

the error occurs here:
dist <- as.single((t(pos)-pos)/n)

where pos is a matrix of integers, and n is the size of the first
dimension. It appears to first create a double with (t(pos)-pos)/n,
running out of memory before making it a single.

Several questions arise from this problem: 1) how do I determine how much
memory is free within the program?, 2) how do I determine how much memory
is being consumed by a given object?, 3) how do I force R to create a
matrix as a single rather than a double?

David,

to check ow much memory R is using just go to the first finder menu, firt item, and you'll have an idea of what is going on.

R itslef needs somthing like 40Mb to run. If you want to use large data you shoud assign memory to R before stanting it. To do get the information on R application (from Finder: select R icon and press Command+I). Try to assing R more memory than it standard settings.

In case you need a very big amount of memory enable the virtual memory (from Control Panels/Memory) and assign R a huge amount of memory.

To see how fast R eats memory try to leave the Finder Info window open, run R and try to allocate your 1000^2 array...

The rest of your questions are not Macintosh specific so other R lists will be more helpful
