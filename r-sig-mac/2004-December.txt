I just installed this versions: 1.02-pre build 786
I still do not get accents to survive a trip to R console.
Worse, I cannot open R program (script) files that are saved inside a 
folder with accents in its name. For instance I had a test program 
inside a folder called "?tude des GAMs" and I was not able to open it. 
Renaming the folder "Etude des GAMs" allowed me to open program files 
inside it. A few tests suggest that an accent anywhere on the complete 
path will prevent R from opening the file. This is rather disturbing to 
a francophone user who might have plenty of accents all over the place 
on the hard disk.

I will admit I have not tried yet to manipulate the "locale" 
information like another user suggested on this list. After reading 
your message I thought I did not need to.

You do need to.  R uses 8-bit characters internally, and relies on the 
system to tell it which bytes correspond to printable characters. This is 
locale-dependent, and so it isn't possible to get it right without the 
right locale. There are other reasons to use the right locale, but they 
don't apply as strongly to French (eg, a number of languages from around 
the Baltic have importantly different collating orders from English)
There are plans to convert the internals of R to Unicode (probably UCS-2 
rather than UTF-8) but it isn't there yet.

That is weird - it works for me, but see below and fetch tonight's 
build.

True, I have fixed that glitch - cStrings were used in the file 
handling instead of native strings. Dropping and sourcing of files 
containing special characters should work now (since tonight's build 
789).

I was fiddling around with the various locales, but it seems that Cocoa 
doesn't quite honor the settings (and R didn't really change its 
behavior either). This is no big deal for us, since we use UTF-8 
internally, but it would be an issue if we converted back to cStrings 
(what I proposed in my last e-mail), because then locales again 
wouldn't work. For now, I keep everything at UTF-8, which makes editor, 
console, file open/drop and copy/paste work, but the user should be 
aware of the fact that R will have some issues as I sketched in my 
previous e-mail.

Cheers,
Simon

I  build a version of my hacked R-2.0.1 on Tiger (OX 10.4b2), using the

things seem to work, including the resource fork hack. Remember,  
however, that Tiger will
come with gcc-4.0 (and with gfortran replacing g77). I'll try to get a

because of the additional optimization possibilities. The g77 3.3.5  
build has --disable-shared

Two questions:
aqua tcl/tk is included with Tiger, what do you mean with "I rebuild  
aqua tcl/tk"?
the second: gfortran ? can you send me a version info.
btw, it works fine for me with g95 which I suppose is gfortran, but I  
get g95 from HPC page not from apple.

OK. This should read "I stupidly rebuild aqua tcl/tk".

Starting from gcc-3.5 the FORTRAN driver is called gfortran, not g95 or  
g77.

I did not get it from Apple either, bur from the CVS pages of the FSF  
(which is where Gaurav
gets it as well). I build my own, because (a) I want gcj, and (b) I  
want to make sure there are
no shared libraries build for libgcc and friends in /usr/local

so, that's what I suspected as well. Apple won't ship any fortran  
compiler for this release of Mac OS X :(

Observe that this is a bootstrap build of gcc/g77/gcj 3.3.5 on Tiger,  
not a Panther build. And the code comes from the FSF tree, not from
Apple. So far, I had no success with the --enable-altivec flag.

Configure R (somewhat verbosely, just to be sure) as

configure  
--with-tcl-config=/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh  
--enable-R-shlib --with-aqua --with-blas='-framework vecLib'

TCLTK_CPPFLAGS='-I/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.Framework/Headers  
-I/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.Framework/Headers'

Obviously this eliminates the need to install Tcl/Tk Aqua.

well, I forgot to mention. No hack is necessary apparently. In my  
build, aqua tcltk works smoothly from the command line without any  
eventloop handling in R.
And I think this is a major improvement. Of course, still brakes R.app  
but at least ESS people not using quartz can work without problems.
At this point, probably the hack is only needed for making the quartz  
device respond to events.

It would be interesting to understand how they managed to make aqua  
tcltk work without a CFRunLoop in R (which your hack "runs").

I am sure they used the unpublished API that can be used to let command  
line applications use the
window server.

Just a few quick thoughts on this discussion.

1.  Please don't discuss Tiger on a public mail list.  Apple get very 
touchy about public discussion of stuff under NDAs.  It ends up with 
them getting more secretive.

2.  What used to be gcc-3.5 has been renamed gcc-4.0.  It is the same 
code only the name has been changed.

3.  If you want Fortran, it is very easy to pull Apple sources from the 
cvs at the FSF web site http://gcc.gnu.org.  Just use one of the 
apple-ppc-4XXX tags.  To see which one is the latest look at the webcvs 
first.  All the tags appear in the popup at the bottom of the web cvs 
pages.
To build Fortran just change the list of languages in the build_gcc 
script.  You will also need GMP and MPRF libraries.  Google will find 
them and they build without mods on Panther.

Finally if you just want a binary, apart from Gaurav Kanna's excellent 
site, there is a gcc-4.0 binary built last week from tag apple-ppc-4020 
on my web site for Swarm on MacOS X binaries at
http://banking.web.unsw.edu.au/w.northcott .  This binary package 
includes GFortran, libffi and libobjc-gnu (GNU Objective-C runtime) 
which are not part of a normal Apple build.

Message-ID: <365E4DAA-44D1-11D9-8083-000D93C24D64@stat.harvard.edu>

Haven't had much time for messing about with R (or StatPaper or 
anything else) recently, but I added this one a while back and its 
proven useful. Basically, it adds Growl Notifications 
(http://www.growl.info) to R such that you receive a notification via 
Growl when 1) R is in the background and 2) the computation has run 
longer than 'x' seconds (where 'x' is in the defaults dictionary). 
There's no hook to the preferences (since I use it personally and just 
set the defaults from Terminal) for anything, but I suppose I could be 
goaded into such a thing if people are interested. It seems like it 
should go in the 'Misc' Pane to me.

To build it once you've done the patch you need to weak link the 
GrowlAppBridge framework (-weak_framework GrowlAppBridge), so it will 
still work for people who haven't installed Growl. Diffing the project 
files doesn't work well so I didn't include that part.

you are right. But we said nothing more than what is public (it's a 
fact that apple ships aqua tcltk and gcc 3.5).
And I think it's good to know that R builds on Tiger too. But 
discussing the non public APIs is not good, I agree.

Thanks for all the other hints Bill.

Hi,

First, thank you Simon, my accented vowels now display correctly in the 
R console.

Now a question to all. I tried using lattice graphics for the first 
time. Unlike other graphics, I notice a difference between what is 
drawn into quartz() devices and what is drawn using pdf() devices. In 
the former the background is grey and not particularly pretty. The 
background is the normal white in pdf devices. Am I doing something 
wrong?

Hello,

I am trying to use the tkrplot library and get the following error.

Loading required package: tcltk
Error in structure(.External("dotTcl", ..., PACKAGE = "tcltk"), class

I have tried to install the latest version of the tcl/tk library (8.4.8),
and to rebuild the latest R-devel without --with-aqua, but I still
have this problem.

X11 and the tcltk package work without problem.

As explained by Jan,

I tried to link tkrplot (with R CMD SHILB) and to change tkrplot.R,
but it still says it is not a Mach-O library file :

Error in structure(.External("dotTcl", ..., PACKAGE = "tcltk"), class = "tclObj") :

.
Error in library(tkrplot) : .First.lib failed for 'tkrplot'


Is there a way to make it work ?

Thanks

I normally run trellis.par.set(col.whitebg()) before any lattice code
- this sets the default colourscheme to one with a white background,
similar to the default pdf output.

Yes, there is a way to make it work. You have to download it, then  
build it
with R CMD INSTALL, and then move to the src directory and repeat the  
final link
statement (cut and paste) with the "--bundle -o tkrplot.so" replaced by
"--dynamic -o libtkrplot.dylib". Then move libtrkplot.dylib by hand to  
the lib dirctory
of the tkrplot installation and change the code at the end of tkrplot.R  
such that
it uses the dylib extension.

R CMS SHLIB just builds a bundle, not a library.

I was doing some stress tests and came across a handful of issues.

Version: R 2.0.1 downloaded from CRAN, standard install.  Using 3  
December 2004 version of R.app from (  
http://www.rosuda.org/R/nightly/other/R-GUI.dmg ).

All tests done on a 12" PowerBook G4 (original) with 640 MB of RAM.

Source code leading to crash:

library(cluster)

plot(hclust(dist(xclara)))

This leads to a long wait where the application is frozen (spinning  
status bar going the entire time), a quartz window displays without any  
content, and then the following application crash occurs:

Works okay, though when attempting to display those results it freezes  
up the entire system, probably as  the result of memory  
threshing/starvation if the top results are any indicator:

Please post this to the maintainers of the cluster library (if at all), 
since this has nothing to do with the GUI (behaves the same in X11). 
The above doesn't make much sense anyway - you definitely want to use 
cutree before you plot that dendogram ...

Well, this is a *package*, not a library {please, please!}

And really, that has nothing to do with the 'cluster' package
(whose maintainer I am), as David only uses its data set.
hclust() and dist() are in the standard 'stats' package.

Btw, this can be accomplished more cleanly, i.e., without
attaching "cluster", by 

  data(xclara, package = "cluster")

Indeed!  

A bit more explicitly for David:
xclara has 3000 observations, 
i.e. 3000*2999/2 ~= 4.5 Mio distances {i.e., a bit more than 36
MBytes to keep in memory and about 48 mio characters to display
when you use default options(digits=7)}.
I don't think you can really make much of printing these many
numbers onto your console as you try with

    David> dist(xclara) -> xclara.dist

"freezes up the entire system"  when trying to print something
too large actually has something to do with user interface.
AFAIK, it doesn't work 'nicely' on any R console,
but at least in ESS on Linux, it's just that one Emacs,
displaying the "wrist watch" (and I can easily tell emacs "not
to wait" by pressing Ctrl g").  Also, just trying it now {on a
machine with large amounts of RAM}: After pressing return, it at
least starts printing (displaying to the *R* buffer) after a bit
more than 1 minute.. and that does ``seem'' to never finish.
I can signal a break (via the [Signals] Menu or C-c C-c in
Emacs), and still have to wait about 2-3 minutes for the output
stops; but it does, and I can work on.. {well, in theory; my Emacs
seems to have become v..e..r..y  s...l...o....w}  We only
recently had a variation on this theme in the ESS-help mailing
list, and several people were reporting they couldn't really
stop R from printing and had to kill the R process...

So after all, there's not quite a trivial problem "hidden" in
David's report :  What should happen if the user accidentally
wants to print a huge object to console... how to make sure R
can be told to stop.

And as I see it now, there's even something like an R "bug" (or
"design infelicity") here:

I've now done it again {on a compute server Dual-Opteron with 4
GB RAM}:  After stopping, via the ESS [Signals] [Break (C-c C-c)] menu,
   Emacs stops immediately, but R doesn't return quickly,
and rather, watching "top" {the good ol' unix process monitor} I
see R using 99.9% CPU and it's memory footage ("VIRT" and 
"SHR") increasing and increasing..., upto '1081m', a bit more
than 1 GB, when R finally returns (displays the prompt) after
only a few minutes --- but then, as said, this is on a remote
64bit machine with 4000 MB RAM.

BTW, when I then remove the 'dist' (and hclust) objects in R,
and type  gc(),
(or maybe do some other things in R; the R process has about
halfed its apparent memory usage to 500something MB.  

more stats: 
     during printing:  798 m
     after "break"  :  798, for ~5 seconds, then starting to
		       grow; slowly (in my top, in steps of ~ 10m)
		       upto 1076m
         then the R prompt is displayed and top shows "1081m".

It stays there , until I do  
   > gc()
where it goes down to VIRT 841m (RES 823m)
and after removing the large distance object, and gc() again,
it lowers to 820m (RES 790m) and stays there.

Probably this thread should be moved to R-devel -- and hence I
crosspost for once.

Martin

Hi Anthony and David,

Can we please move this discussion to R-SIG-Mac. Most R GUI questions 
are posted on that list.

Is it possible either of you send me a copy of a file with the weird 
characters in it. Just a few
lines should do it. Early on we had a few of these issues with non-Unix 
terminated lines
in editors, e.g. MAC lines are typically CR terminated, or Window lines 
are terminated
by CRLF. But Simon solved all of these a while ago.

Which version of R are you using (2.0.1 from CRAN or the nightly build 
from Rosuda)?

Thanks,
Rob

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] saving graphs; jpeg(), bitmap()
Message-ID: <p06100500bddd2efac895@[83.132.29.100]>

Dear Mac R-users

I want to export some plots. I have looked in the documentation and 
in the R-help archives. 2 main functions jpeg(), bitmap() are used, 
but I can't save any plots using them. (error logs at the end of the 
email). I'm using a PowerBook G4, Panther 10.3, R.2.1.

a) when using jpeg() I seem to be missing the X11 server. I have X11 
on my computer and it works fine. (XDarwin 1.3b4). On the R menu, 
under Miscillaneous there is a Run X11 server. When I lauch it 
reports an error:  "2004-12-08 22:24:13.082 open[10513] Couldn't 
launch application:  X11.app"

b) for using bitmap() I don't have the ghostscript file. Is it a mac 
file? Should I get it from somewhere?

c) I saved the files from the quartz device with the menu function. 
This solves the problem somewhat, but: I would like to save jpeg 
files. Even if I save pdf I would like to write it in a script. 
pdf() should do it, but I can only produce files with zero bytes 
using it...

d) and this is really just curiosity. The pdf file exported via menu 
is small (16kb) but when I open it in Photoshop and tell it to be 
300dpi becomes a big file (14Mb) and the quality is very good! I 
imagine this to be related to vectors instead of dots. I googled the 
terms, but there's nothing that mention pdfs as good grahp formats (I 
didn't do an extensive search, there were MANY documents, even trying 
to be very stringent)

Below an example of how I use jpeg. Make sure you start X11, either 
from R Console toolbar,
from Finder or the dock (you can close the X11 command window but *not 
*X11 - i.e. notice
the little black triangle if X11 is in your dock):

jpeg(file="./Books/Good/l1lsat.jpg")
op <- par(mfrow=c(1, 2))	# 1 row, 2 plots in this example
hist(rnorm(100))
boxplot(rnorm(25) , horizontal=T)
par(op)	# reset to previous par() settings
dev.off()

Let me know if this works,
Rob

Hi Tiago,
you need to run the X11 server first indeed.
Close R and try just to launch X11 from its icon.
If it doesn't launch, please have a look at the Console Application 
window to see what's happening. Let us know.

Um... why do you use XDarwin instead of the supported Apple X11 which 
comes with Mac OS X? The GUI (i.e. that button) is designed to work 
with Apple's X11, because it's the official standard (you don't even 
have to download it..). Last time I saw XDarwin its WM were much less 
well integrated that quartz-wm...

You can still use XDarwin if you feel like it, but in any case make 
sure your DISPLAY is set - if in doubt, type
Sys.setenv(DISPLAY=":0.0")
in R before using those graphics devices.

gs is basically a program running on most platforms, including Mac - if 
you use TeX then you should have gs already installed (or you can get 
it via i-Installer along with the TeX stuff).

PDF is actually a very good format supporting both bitmap (cf 
PhotoShop) and vector graphics (cf Illustrator) - it's even better than 
old PostScript, because it supports transparency and other cool things. 
Mac OS X actually uses PDF as its main display format. In fact PS used 
to be the standard for publishing and nowadays PDF is replacing that 
role. As a Mac user you're in the fortunate position of having many 
good PDF tools at your fingertips (in contrast to the Win folks :P).

Cheers,
Simon

Tiago, Simon is right. You should probably use Apple X11 or set the

well, let me say that the PDF file saved via R menus on mac, makes a 
copy of the current graphic device (quartz) on the R pdf() device. It's 
order of magnitude smaller that what you get by using quartz (but don't 
ask me why, I simply don't have to check at the moment).

There's not much we can do about the Quartz file sizes---Quartz doesn't 
do much compression and includes a lot of redundant 
information---either for safety reasons or size/speed tradeoff. There 
are a couple of post-processing tools that can shrink Quartz PDFs, but 
who knows. Rumor has it that Tiger's PDFKit may help with that.

Message-ID: <D1DFF0F7-497C-11D9-BA8C-000D93C24D64@stat.harvard.edu>

For some reason this never went out to the list last night, so I'll  
give it another shot (apologies if the original mysteriously appears):

I got tired of patching the GUI source tree so I wrapped up my Growl  
Notifications as a package. As an added bonus it also now works from  
command-line R as well (ESS, X11, etc) though it can't detect when the  
command-line R is active and suppress notifications. I also added a  
'growlnotify' function that lets you send an arbitrary notification  
message from R.

Sources at:

http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~bcellis/growl_1.0.tar.gz

Binaries at:

http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~bcellis/growl_1.0_R_powerpc-apple- 
darwin7.6.0.tar.gz

built using R-devel (2004-11-30) on 10.3.6. It should work on any of  
the R GUIs since it patches R_Busy directly. I even documented things a  
little bit :-)

Look for:

growlnotify
growlSystemNotifications

If it seems like things are reasonable stable, I'll probably submit the  
package to CPAN at some point. Feedback appreciated.

P.S. Using hints from DTL's RObjectiveC makefile this package uses  
Objective-C without requiring a patched version of R's build scripts.  
With method swizzling, little packages have become my favored method of  
prototyping and providing GUI features for myself.... just in case  
y'all were interested :-)

just in case I forgot to respond to your first "growl" mail:
I'd veto general inclusion of the "growl" patch, because it's a 
non-standard addition to the system, which the majority of users don't 
have. However, it highlights the need for some plug-in concept in our 
GUI - the question is what functionality should we expose to such 
plugins? Cocoa has nice ways of building plugin concepts, but we'd need 
to define the GUI<->Plugin interface first. Any ideas?

Well, except for you nobody used patched R for Obj-C ;P

Indeed, that's what packages are for ;). It's about linking native code 
to R. But for Cocoa, I'd use one of the Obj-C/R proxies for 
prototyping, because it's much faster - no need to re-compile 
anything... You really learn to appreciate interpreters when you test 
small and dirty things :).

Thank you all for replying to my email.  Rest assured that I realize 
that this is a luxury that I fully understand and appreciate.

I have written a long email with the details of my attempts to solve 
the problem. In very short: I couldn't yet write the files using the 
R console. I can export pdf files using the menu and those files have 
good quality for what I need - so if I can't solve this I will just 
export those files manually (a little more time consuming but 
definitely doable in my case)

I have written in all this detail, since I might be the type of 
person that you will end up getting a lot. (someone coming to R 
through microarrays, no background in computer science but willing to 
install the programs and willing to make an effort to have a basic 
understanding of what is happening, at least the basic concepts.)

a) I tried Rob's approach of having the Xserver running (little 
triangle on the dock).
I don't get an error any longer - it looks R is now recognizing and 
connecting to the X server. Unfortunately the file that is written is 
empty. It writes a file but it has 0 Kb (by the way, when giving the 
error it also writes the file 0Kb)

b) Simon Urbanek mentions that I should be running X11 from Apple. I 
thought the X11 I was running was from Apple. I clicked on the icon 
that was in the applications folder that has a big red X and it 
started running XDarwin and I assumed that that was the Apple's X11 
server. Apparenlty it isn't.

I had to open this X11 to use XEmacs (that I installed with fink). I 
have tried to look for that other Apple's X11 that should be in my 
computer but I cannot find it anywhere. Maybe my computer wasn't 
installed with that original Apple X11? Is that possible?

Trying Sys.setenv(DISPLAY=":0.0")  or sys.setenv(DISPLAY=":0.0") in 
my R gives the same message that the function doesn't work... (Simon 
asked me to that this)

I couldn't find the file ghostscript. There are 109 files with 
ghostscript on my computer, all in the fink folders. But none of them 
are the actual file (it's ghostscript info, patch, fonts, nox but 
nothing that seems the file itself). I installed i-installer but the 
installer.app is not there! (I sent the person an email about this). 
So I don't have the ghostscript file. If I have it, where exactly 
should I place it?

c) Stephan suggests "set the DISPLAY var on your own". I don't know 
what this means. I guess that is to link my X11 to R but I don't know 
how to do this.

d) I couldn't understand whether there is not a way besides the menu 
to save pdf files. Or all those methods are also dependent on the 
problems from above?

Again thank you all - Rob, Stefano, Simon, for the help and all the work.

It looks like a ghostscript issue. Perhaps you should install/update it.

*bangs his head against a wall*
my mistake - it's

Sys.putenv(DISPLAY=":0.0")

in C you can use both setenv and putenv, in csh it's setenv so I mix 
those things up :P

As of Apple's X11 - look in Applications -> Utilities and there should 
be X11. But XDarwin and other X11 are usually mutually exclusive, so I 
doubt that you have Apple's X11. I have no idea why someone would 
install XDarwin instead of Apple's X11 nowadays, it makes no sense to 
me, but maybe someone can explain that.

> I couldn't find the file ghostscript.

The "file" is just "gs" - GhostScript is just the name of the program 
is called.

it's what I tried to make you with the Sys.putenv ;)

I'm not sure, but AFAIK the pdf device is independent of X (see ?pdf in 
R).

my guess was that he had 10.1 or 10.2 with Xdarwin, then upgraded to 10.3. 
this could result in 10.3+XDarwin.

mostly xdarwin binaries seemed to die, at some point, though... there was 
some kinda timeout built into at least some versions of it.

Hmm.. for 10.2 there was the Apple beta already, but you're right, a 
much-updated system may have XD for historical reasons - but I'd get 
rid of it asap :P. On the other hand, supposedly fink is installed, 
too, but fink is incompatible across versions, you can't upgrade, you 
must re-install, so it seems like a quite messed up system to me ;). 
Ah, well, wait for Tiger, that should make fink obsolete even for 
Bioconductor ... (hopefully...) ;)

Yes, it was more a hack than stable platform - but up to 10.1 you had 
no choice ... I especially hated the WM - it didn't cooperate well with 
other windows and in general copy/paste was a pain... I don't miss that 
:P

I had to install Apple's X11 from one of the installation CDs; it was 
not installed by default.

Good luck!

Hi Tiago,

I am surprised pdf() does not work for you, I use it all the time both 
under Mac OS X 10.2.8 (old R gui, R2.0.1) and OS 10.3.6 (new R gui, R 
2.0.1). This file format is one of the things that I really like in R. 
Great output quality in small file size. Works well in all my 
applications (except Microsoft products, shame on MS).

I use JPEG only when it is requested by an editor (only happened once 
for a conference proceedings, the editor did not know a better way to 
handle without pain (for him) graphics from users on different 
platforms. Otherwise I avoid it for scientific graphs as it is 
resolution dependent and zooming quickly reveals pixels and compression 
artefacts. Beside, even though JPEG greatly reduces the size of 
bitmaps, the resulting file is still larger than PDF or other vector 
formats.

Hence I hope you can resolve what prevents you from using pdf() in your 
scripts. Did you use
dev.off()
to terminate file creation?

Sincerely,

Denis Chabot

As a general advise.
Once you have a pdf file you can use Preview application (shipped with 
OS X) to export it to almost any format.
If jpeg() and png() do not work, please have a look at any error 
message you get on the R Console or in the Console Application.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] summary: MacOSX, Panther;
 save graphs, jpg(), pdf(), bitmap(), Ghostscript, X11 server
Message-ID: <p06100500bdde1378678b@[83.132.29.100]>

So after taking some time and bothering some people (Thanks very much 
to all of them: Simon Urbanek, Rob J Goedman, Stefano Iacus, Byron 
Ellis, Elijah Wright, Denis Chabot, Nathan Weisz) I solved the 
problem.

I decided to write this summary. It's kind of long, but it might be 
helpeful to someone else.

Two problems: installation and knowledge on how to use R. This is 
valid for Panther 10.3.6, R 2.01 in a PowerBookG4.

I) Installation

X11 server has to be running. Go to Misc, Run X11 Server. You have to 
have X11 installed in your computer. Some Macs don't have it 
installed. It's on the 3rd CD. You can also download it from: 
http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/download/

2) Saving graphs:
jpeg(), png(), pdf()

a) You have to have X11 running. Go to Misc, RunX11 server, let X11 
opened, don't close it.

b)to save a file you first have to open a device.
this was confusing to me, so let me be clear for other people like 
myself (supposing I am not the only one having this problem...).

jpeg() and png() pdf() are NOT used to save plots AFTER the plots are 
done. That's not what they do.

example:
jpeg("myfile.jpg")   #opens a device - saves a file in your directory 
but it has 0 Kb
plot(1:10)               #places the plot in the device - still 0 Kb 
file in your directory
dev.off()                  #closes the device and saves the contents 
of the plot in file.
                                 #you now have a file


3) there is another way to save graphs:
bitmap()

for that you need to have Ghostscript installed. I dowloaded 
Ghostscript, but using bitmap() sill does't work, it still can't find 
Ghostscript, I don't know where I have to install it, but I don't 
really need it.

General considerations:
a) It's always possible to save pdfs files from the active device on 
the menu: file > save
b) cut and paste also works
c) pdfs are wonderful for graphs and lines. I was surprised by the 
quality and the small size of the file. Another show of my ignorance.
d) I am very surprised that this has not been an issue. I think the 
functions are not very intuitive and the help pages, although clear 
NOW, didn't help me that much when I first read them.
e) I'm curious about this on windows. Do they also go through this 
device process?
f) you people are wonderful. Thanks for all the support and the help 
that I have had. It was a little time consuming but I've learned a 
lot in the process.

Don't forget command-shift-4, which allows you to save any rectangular  
portion of the screen to
a png file. Since it's on the keyboard it's fast, and it's flexible.  
Works with both X11 and Quartz
devices, and can easily be used from CLI, ESS and Aqua interfaces to R.

Some time ago I promised to look into this issue. With Cocoa's undo 
mechanism
it is indeed not hard to solve, but for R.app it turns out a proper 
solution will take
significant work - R Console and other windows should all become 
'proper' windows.
If not, undo/redo in the menu bar will get very confused.

Hence, at least for now, it will remain as Ben describes (redo to the 
rescue :-),
sorry about that,
Rob

Thanks for the summary Tiago.

X11 is only needed for jpeg and png. I would take Stefano's advice, use 
pdf and use Apple's
previewer to export in many different formats.

In this case it is unfortunate 'example(pdf)' does not create a small 
example file.

Make sure it's on the PATH. If you had used i-Installer then it would 
be on the PATH already...

If you used fink to install gs, then this is more easily said than 
done, because it heavily depends on where you use it from. But I assume 
that you want to use it from R, so the most reliable thing to do is to 
create a symlink in /usr/local/bin, because R automatically adds that 
directory to the PATH.

First, you have to find out where gs lives - I guess it should be 
somewhere in /sw as that's what fink uses by default. Let's say you 
find it in /sw/bin/gs then what you need to do is to type in Terminal:

sudo ln -s /sw/bin/gs /usr/local/bin/gs

if it complains that /usr/local/bin doesn't exist, then type
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
and repeat the above - that should give you gs in R

All this is documented in R help pages ...and the examples, too :P
BTW, AFAIR: the ## End(not run) comments are generated automatically to 
denote examples that are not run when doing make check - so it's not 
something the writers of the documentation put there to annoy you ;).

Since the device calls are mostly used in scripts, it would lead to 
quite nasty results if they were that noisy. R is a fairly complex 
software - if you want to use all its features, you have to learn a lot 
about it. If you don't want to learn, just relay on the tools that make 
things more simpler, but then you have to live with using only a 
fraction of the available functionality.

Can you, please, describe reproducible examples? The description you 
gave is somewhat useless, because not specific. I know only about the 
undo issue which is being worked on. If you use a PowerBook, make sure 
your problems are not caused by you hitting the touchpad involuntarily 
- that's the most common editing issue, but that's independent of the 
software ...

What do you mean by "there's an error"?!?! runif is just a function and 
if there is an error (I wonder how one can force runif to get en error 
:P), it will indeed stop ... you can influence the behavior of R on an 
error yourself, again, please read the docs or get a book on R ...

I guess, you mean line numbers here (because there *are* lines in the

Well, that's a bit ambiguous, because quite often you have multi-line 
statements, but yes, that could be done easily. Currently you get the 
same effect by using <Option><Shift><Up>, <Cmd><Enter> sequence (if in 
doubt, hitting <Option><Down> before ;)).

Good idea - we should adopt the way Apple handles this in Xcode ... 
shortcut for the help and take the selected word as a starting point

Well, the browser will be completely re-written soon, because the 
current one is far from perfect, but our resources are very limited, so 
it will take a while unless another Cocoa volunteer with good knowledge 
of R internals will pop up ;).

Yes, that's right - one of the cool features in JGR is the object 
browser.

The documented way to tell R how to find the ghostscript executable 
(see ?bitmap) is to set the environment variable R_GSCMD.
I personally would tend to prefer this, because it doesn't require 
mucking about with system directories.

So, first, outside of R, verify the location of the gs command.

[228]% which gs
/sw/bin/gs

Then inside R, before using bitmap(),

>  Sys.putenv(R_GSCMD='/sw/bin/gs')

Then, for example,

>  bitmap(file='foo.png')
>  hist(runif(100))
>  dev.off()

And since this is OS X, quit R and at the unix prompt

open foo.png

And it will open in Preview.

Sure, no problem---it was just something I had done to my own version 
of R since the long running code I'm using throws the GUI into a very 
unresponsive state (on purpose) and I wanted to me reminded when it 
completed. Of course, the nice part about the Growl patch is that the 
weak linking means that the R GUI can detect the presence or absence of 
Growl and disable the functionality if the latter case. Either way, it 
hardly matters now that I've wrapped it up as a package. :-)

That said, a plugin interface would be really nice. At the moment I'm 
tempted to say that the plugins should be R packages rather than Cocoa 
bundles as they serve nearly the same purpose with the R package likely 
being less confusing for users. The problem is that it makes providing 
an interface to certain aspects of the R GUI more of a problem.


Having thought a little bit about it, here are things I'd like from the 
R GUI as a plugin author:

1. Some of the things common to a lot of plugins in a framework (e.g. 
RGUI.framework). This would include the Cocoa interface to the 
evaluator (REngine and friends) and the Quartz device (implementing it 
once was annoying enough :-P) are early candidates. It would obviously 
also hold a lot of the plugin interface information, such as 
notification constants and so on.

2. Support for both plugin modalities
	- "enhancements" which work through delegate and notification 
interfaces (or even internal AppleEvents, which seem to be important 
for certain types of scripting)
	-"replacements" which completely replace certain functionality, script 
editors, the console, data manager and so on. In fact, I would even go 
so far to suggest that the built-in GUI components be implemented in 
such a way to help develop the interface and provide a starting point 
of sorts for interested parties. There are some problems with this idea 
at the moment, particularly with the timing of console initialization 
(and I can imagine a situation where you would want to suppress the 
interactive console entirely), but nothing that seems insurmountable.

3. Support code for common tasks like merging menus and registering 
preference panes and loading Nibs located in packages. Fortunately we 
can do this in categories without much difficulty.

I suppose the best way to work this stuff would be to branch the GUI 
and begin experimenting with a plugin interface to see what is truly 
needed, what simply needs to be "by convention" and what plain doesn't 
work.

Their loss, it was really quite pleasant. ;-) Of course, in this case I 
also needed to set the Deployment Target so I needed the Makefile 
anyway.

Yup, and I would have been able to make it a pure R package if there 
was a setHook() for "busy" too, but there wasn't, so down to Obj-C we 
go. (Sure, it means my code isn't threadsafe, but R I would bet on a 
"busy" setHook before threadsafety :-))

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] X11-tcltk packages and the Aqua help browser
Message-ID: <1103045456.7488.12.camel@ha667-1.commerce.ubc.ca>

I'm working on a modified version of John Fox' Rcmdr package to use in a
course I will begin teaching in February. In preparation for this, I'm
making sure that the package is truly platform independent. On the OS X
side I have run into a minor issue involving how help files get
displayed. Specifically, help files that are triggered withing Rcmdr get
handled as plain text (which Rcmdr provides an X11 tk text window to
display), and not through the Aqua help browser. I'm wondering if there
is a way to have the html help files of Rcmdr displayed in the Aqua help
browser.

What may or may not be obvious from the above description is that the
Rcmdr package is written using the tcltk package, and I'm using the
standard CRAN version of R 2.0.1 on Panther, so tcltk widgets are
handled in X11.

Try setting htmlhelp = TRUE in the options, this should allow Rcmdr to 
call the default html browser.

This problem with help will be fixed in r-devel as we are going to 
redefine the print methods for help.

yes, exactly. "tar zcf xx.tgz path_to_xx_package".
By default, .tgz is the extension for binary packages for R under OS X.

It could be of interest to be able to reproduce it.  Can you give us 
some reproducible small workspace and R.app error log?

yes

not for W?ndows, but under windows tcltk is always available. But you 
are right, it works.

I'm not sure how he can solve this problem since (but probably someone 
here has hints).

we can add an option for that R.app prefs in fact but I'm not sure it 
could work either as launching X11 is not syncronous anyway. Even if 
R.app starts X11 for you, there's no guarantee that X11 is really 
running at the moment R requires it.

do remember that the -z flag to tar is for the *gzip* algorithm, not the 
Dos-world "pkzip" kind of format.

if i didn't know this, the text above would be fairly ambiguous.

no, apart that we want to distinguish platform by extensions and zip is 
likely to be Windows for R.
The other reason is that on mac os x (at the moment) a binary package 
is assumed to have this tar.gz format, I mean for things like 
install.packages() etc on mac os x. R Core is going to make this more 
flexible in R-devel, I mean the R code part to allow for different 
extensions/format with some platform defaults.

Yes, as Eliah pointed out (I wondered why, now I see why :)), we use 
tar+gz on OS X as on any unix platform, that's why --use-zip should not 
be used.

I see,
just defining DISPLAY=:0 won't work in this case.
I think the right thing to do now is just to start X11 before loading

Hello,

I have the following error compiling R-devel since the 2004-12-09 version.
I am using a nightly compile script that worked well until this date, and
I changed nothing to my development environment. What can be the problem ?

Thank you,
Jean

Somebody defined a global variable in Defn.h without making it an 
extern. I'm mostly surprised at how its managed to escape notice for 
the last 5 days.

yes, you also need to add the declaration to src/main.c to make 
everything work.
Committed now.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R for Mac OS X Aqua GUI and utf-8
Message-ID: <41C6DDEA.3010901@fz-rossendorf.de>

I have noticed some mails concerning this in the archive, so I 
understand this has been already discussed and I understand that the R 
gui seems to use utf-8 internally.
I did _not_ find out how to procede, if I the only thing I want is to 
obtain 'R command line version behaviour' with encoding set to something 
like latin1. i.e. I would be  glad if I would be able to get things like 
a german 'umlaut' into string constants (and then into plots).

is there such a way?

thanks
joerg

Currently, no. The problem is quite complex, because just using Latin1 
for the console (i.e. convert everything going into R to Latin1 and do 
so for R output too) does break anything where R passes strings to the 
OS - like file and directory names. I could add an option that switches 
such behavior on, but then the user has to be careful about using 
non-ASCII characters in filenames/paths.

I'll investigate another path though - we should be able to fix the 
plot thing reasonably easily, because it's Cocoa so handling UTF-8 is 
no issue. About the string output - I'll have to see if there is a way 
to convert strings on-the-fly when printing - in theory it should be 
possible, I'll check it out.

Cheers,
Simon

hello simon,
thanks for the quick response.
I think a switch in the preferences would be perfectly ok: if the 
default is the current behaviour the user should be aware of the 
implication for 'valid' file names (as far as I am concerned: I simply 
do use only 7(!)-bit ascii names anyway to avoid any problems in this area).
after all that would be exactly what the command line version does at 
the moment anyway (if encoding is set to latin1).
I think in this way the major restriction (not being able to process 
8-bit character sets) would be removed.

thanks again and best regards,
joerg

Hi all,

I've downloaded 
http://cran.cict.fr/bin/macosx/R-2.0.1.dmg
Installed all the packages (except Aqua) (no error message occured)


Is it possible to forward a check list in order to get R Cocoa Gui running?
(I'm not a programmer and used to Sciviews as GUI for R on Windows machine)



TIA and Best wishes for the new year

Hi Naji,

 From this and your previous email, couple of questions.

1) I'm assuming this is the 1st time you've installed R or the Cocoa R  
GUI? What
do you mean by 'except Aqua', are you installing 'R for Mac OS X  
10.2.mpkg' or
'R for Mac OS X 10.3.mpkg'?
2) By 'processing R' you mean double clicking on the R icon in the  
applications
folder?
3) Does the R Console window pop-up? Or are you trying to run it from a  
terminal window?
Both should work.
4) Where and when does below error message show up? (Error in rm(rlibs)  
: can't remove
variables from base namespace)
5) Which Mac OS X are you running?

In my application folder, I find R only and I'm having the following  
message
when processing R :

Error in rm(rlibs) : can't remove variables from base namespace

Is it possible to forward a check list in order to get R Cocoa Gui  
running?

Hi Tim,
thanks for your report.
I'm forwarding this to R-sig-mac mailing list. Can you also tell us 
which version of the R.app are you using? (see the about box)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] user environment not respected by GUI
Message-ID: <41CA84D8.4090002@fz-rossendorf.de>


only a tiny problem:
the search path for system (unix) commands in the GUI differs from the 
path of the user, as I noted when trying to generate a file list for 
further processing with something like

R> flist <- system("locate *.dat",intern=T)

that works fine (even without protecting the `*'...), problem was, that 
the command uses obviously /usr/bin/locate, despite the fact that in my 
user search path /sw/bin/locate is found before /usr/bin/locate (and 
uses a different default database). I have now simply specified the 
absolute path but it would be nicer to have consistent search paths for 
system commands (I possibly would'nt have noticed, if the other locate 
database would have contained older versions of equally named data files 
(with possibly obsolete content) and _that_ could cause trouble).

so, within the GUI I get

R> system('echo $PATH')
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/vdh:/usr/local/bin

i.e. $HOME/.profile (or in my case .cshrc) are bypassed.

question: where is the search path set for the GUI? can I change it?

regards,
joerg

This isn't actually a problem in R, its due to the fact that 
LaunchService doesn't launch apps through a shell so your profile never 
gets sourced. Instead it gets the environment from the 
Environment.plist file.

thanks for the response.

obviously 'off list', but maybe some others have the same problem in
connection with using R on the Mac:


I  generated the ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file as described under
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html and the entry

<dict>
         <key>PATH</key>
         <string>/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:.:/soft/bin:/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin</string>
</dict>


(string originally on one line) fixes indeed the search path.

joerg

Hi Rene,
please send any further the report to r-sig-mac. It should run smoothly 
under 10.3 so it is worth to know what's really happening.

Hmm.. the crashlogs you supplied are all pretty random, looking more 
like a problem with your system than R GUI itself. The core event and 
window handling didn't change at all since 2.0.0, so AFAICS there is no 
reason for them to behave differently. The logs aren't helpful in 
debugging, because the crashes never actually happen in the GUI ...

Please try the nightly builds and see if you can reproduce the crashes 
somehow ...

Hi RenE,

Hopefully you got my earlier message and you have a moment to download 
Simon's
nightly build form the URL listed in that message.

The behaviour you describe seems somewhat similar as to what I have 
seen after 'Save As'
had been called once (this is, before the patch Simon mentions had been 
applied).

It would be really helpful if you can try this.

Thanks,
Rob

Hi to you all and the usual thanks to the people who make this 
wonderful program and also the ones that so generously help people 
like me

I have been using the editor and have been having some problems. 
Things got much worse two days ago - specially 1) and 3) weren't 
really happening before. All other points were happening very 
frequently. Everything else seems to be working fine in my computer. 
I have very regularly used the nightly build from Simon Urbanek as 
little and very useful things are always improving, but I cannot 
recall whether problems 1) and 3) started with one of those "fresh" R 
applications.

R.Version():
$platform
[1] "powerpc-apple-darwin6.8"
R.2.01
PowerBook G4
OS 10.3.7

1) clicking in a .R doocument opens R  but then it crashes 
immediately. It asks me if I want to send a "Bug Report" to apple - 
see text below of that report

2) cut and paste to an editor window causes an error: 2004-12-27 
12:27:03.758 R[363] *** NSTimer discarding exception 
'NSRangeException' (reason '*** NSRunStorage, 
_NSBlockNumberForIndex(): index (1944) beyond array bounds (1000)') 
that raised during firing of timer with target 3b75e0 and selector 
'runRELP:'

3) sending from the editor to the console (apple-enter) simple 
commands such as:
t.control='x'
or library(multtest) causes a syntax error
typing the exact samething in the console works fine
I opened my file.R in xemacs and I realize that the lines that give 
me an error start "invisibly" with some ^
I CANNOT see these symbols in the editor window and deleting the 
spaces doesn't help
to be clearer:
what I see in the editor window:
library(siggenes)
what I see in xemacs:
^_^^^^library(siggenes).
Not all the lines have these symbols at the beginning.
This is what is most likely causing the error when I send the call to 
the console

4) opening a new window (apple-n) causes R to crash - this happens 
frequently but not all the time

5) The other issue that I get very frequently is that the editor 
window goes blank. The text is still there - if I select it it 
becomes visible, but it keeps disapearing. I cannot pinpoint when 
exactly this happens or what is the action that causes it.

6) the welll known problem with the undo control having an "extreme" 
behaviour is also a major problem - I know it's not easy to solve - 
but just to point out that it is indeed a relevant issue to some 
people

7) this happened just once, so I don't know how relevant it is to 
help in the diagnostic: typing in the console:
xx=data.frame(x=sample(100), y=sample(100))
xx=stack(xx)
xx
2004-12-27 11:31:26.063 R[3797] *** NSRunStorage, 
_NSBlockNumberForIndex(): index (4655) beyond array bounds (2000)

8) not really related to R, but maybe someone can give me a pointer 
to the following: I can get xemacs running if I type in the terminal 
xemacs. But if I open X11 and type xemacs I get: "bash: xemacs: 
command not found". A while ago I had Darwin running as the X11 and 
thanks to very helpful people in this list I replaced it with the 
Apple newer version. With Darwin xemacs run simply typing xemacs (in 
the same way that it does now from the terminal)

Hi Tiago,

Trying to work through the issues you've raised one by one.

1) Can you please try to click on a doc while you're sure there is no
     .RData file in the working directory. I think what might be 
happening
    is that .RData expects X.11 to be running (if not, R will crash). Or
    you could start X.11 before clicking on the .R file.

2) What are you exactly cut & pasting? From 1 edit window to another?
     From another app or editor to the R editor? Would it be possible 
for you
     to try c&P from a 'good' .R  file in an edit window to another edit 
window?
     Are the c&p blocks very large?

3) This item sounds very similar to an issue I think you raised a 
number of
      weeks ago. Is that right?

4) This one I can reproduce. It happens when no edit window is open. It
      works fine if an edit window is open. I'll look into why.

5) I'll try to reproduce this one. Seems like the text attributes are 
messed up
     and set to the background color.

6) Noted!

7) This one is very weird. Just executing the 1st statement leaves R in 
a
     unstable state if you try to print the variable it is assigned to. 
Not sure
     what sample(100) means. sample(1:100, 100). I wonder if this is an
     example of the case mentioned in the help page for sample(x) and
     x is variable.

8) Didn't Xemacs come with your original X.11 (the non-Apple one)? I 
tried
      Emacs (from Jan de Leeuw's web page) and this works fine.

After this reply I'll take Tiago's issues off-line unless folks let me 
know they
want to be in the loop.

I have added a new build target named "Debug" to the R GUI - the 
corresponding nightly binaries can be obtained from the nightly build 
pages as usual:
http://www.rosuda.org/R/nightly/
The debugging build should be used when reporting error/crashes as it 
prints more debugging informations on such occasions. The binary is not 
optimized, but since R library used by the GUI is still the same, there 
should be no noticeable slowdown compared to the regular build in 
(which means that you may as well use the debug build when testing 
"nightlies").

I'm trying to track down some errors reported to this list earlier - 
some are addressed in the current build, others should follow later 
this week.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi RenE,

Thanks for your efforts to pinpoint these issues.

Below set of issues have now been fixed (and will be incorporated into 
Simon's
nightly build 877):

and

It makes no difference if files passed on the command line are to be 
opened in a window or sourced (this option seems not to have any 
effect, BTW). The same command has the expected effect when R.app is 
already running (with the exception of the aforementioned option).

Feedback, as always, is more than welcome. Before adding some features 
to the editor (line
numbers!), I really would like the existing code to be solid.

The font issue on RQuartz is more complicated and a new topic for me. 
I'll take a look early
next year. Once I understand it better, I will enable the font 
selection in the preferences
panel.

Hi Rob,

Thanks :) I'll be downloading a new build tomorrow, then.

In the meantime: the issue with Helvetica Narrow also exists with R under 
X11, which should I think use little Mac specific graphics code. If I copy a 
graph using dev.copy2eps( family="HelveticaNarrow", ...), I still get an eps 
file calling for Helvetica-Narrow. I'm not sure what to think of this, but 
it seems clear that at least some of the font handling issues go deeper than 
just being Mac specific.

The Save/Save As command, what does it actually do? Redraw the graph using 
R's own pdf() device, or use OS/X's pdf 'metafile' format? That latter 
option used generate pdf files that I had trouble importing into Illustrator 
CS (with R 1.9.1) whereas that seems to go smoothly now.

Best,
Ren

makes a dev copy to R own pdf() device.
about fonts: you can only use Postscript families as font names.
