Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R refuses to run
Message-ID: <371904a90504301823598af6ab@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all. I apologize if there's an obvious solution to my problem,
but I'm afraid I don't know my way around UNIX well enough to narrow
down the cause of the problem.

A few weeks ago, after downloading the LME4 library and working on
some mixed models, the R version 2.0.1 crashed (I was then running Mac
OS X 10.3.8). It then would refuse to run (GUI window opens briefly,
then closes again), when either selected from the Finder or when
prompted in Terminal (R.app). I tried to trash everything I could find
to do with R, including R.app from the Applications folder and the
R-framework folder from the System:Library and do a "clean" reinstall,
but the restored version still refused to run.

Recently I've upgraded the system to 10.3.9, and just yesterday ran
the R 2.1.0 installer, but still nothing! I'm sorry that I have no bug
report or crash log to offer, but if someone tells me where to look
for it, I'll acquire it. Please, any advice as to what to do to regain
the use of R!

gfortran from hpc.sf.net for Tiger is choking on eigen.f for some  
reason (full on compiler error). Any clues? I tried going back to  
g77, but there saveFP and restFP rear their ugly heads once more.

Step 1 - check whether R runs at all. Start Terminal and type
R
(just R, no app). Does this work?

Step 2 - remove workspace that may cause trouble
If you don't mind deleting your current workspace from your home,  
please do so - i.e. type the following in Terminal:
rm -f .RData ~/.RData

Step 3 - run the R.app
Double-clock on the R icon in Applications. If it comes up and  
disappears again, please go to Applications -> Utilities and start  
"Console"
Depending on your settings you may already see the error message in  
the log. Otherwise look at the other log files in the left menu. If  
there is no list of logs on the left hand side, click on the "Logs"  
icon in the toolbar. The crash logs are usually in ~/Library/Logs ->  
CrashReporter and then R.app

Please let us know whether you were able to fix the problem or supply  
us with any errors you find in the logs.

Cheers,
Simon

I've had this problem and worked around it by
1) starting without the workspace, i.e.,
    R --no-restore-data
2) then loading the lme4 package
    library(lme4)
3) and finally loading the workspace
    load(".RData")

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] mac.binary: inconsistent naming
Message-ID: <63ea160646dbd52c3ebf82d3894774b5@sun3.oulu.fi>

I installed the official Mac binary of R.app 2.1.0 today. I tried to 
update all installed packages. Because installing source packages is 
very, very, very slow(*) I decided to update.packages with 
type="mac.binary". However, this results in the following error:

trying URL 
'http://cran.dk.r-project.org/bin/macosx/2.1/ade4_1.3-3.tar.gz'
Error in download.file(url, destfile, method, mode = "wb") :
	cannot open URL 
'http://cran.dk.r-project.org/bin/macosx/2.1/ade4_1.3-3.tar.gz'
In addition: Warning message:
cannot open: HTTP status was '404 Not Found'

So the problem is that update.packages looks for package name *.tar.gz, 
but the repository has packages with name *.tgz. Is there a way to 
circumvent this?

A related problem is that when you install from local binary files, the 
installer expects the type to be tgz. However, R CMD build --binary  
makes a package name *_*_R_powerpc-apple-darwin7.9.0.tar.gz which 
cannot be installed locally before renaming (and again, tar.gz instead 
of tgz is the violation).

Wouldn't it be nice to have these things consistent, in particular for 
us poor mac users who cannot type and hardly now where to find the 
Terminal.app?

Then to slowness marked above as:
(*) I have found out that installing source packages can be extremely 
slow in R.app. It seems that perl pieces in particular are very slow. 
Processing Rd files may take ages (that is minutes to tens of minutes 
per package). This is a property of R.app GUI: if you download the 
source and build to binary in command line, the process is much faster. 
What could be an explanation here?

Enough for today. BTW, thanks for the fine work: not only for the R 
source, but also for the R.app.

Why would you do that? The Package Installer in the GUI allows you to  
install binary packages [it's even the default!] so you don't need to  
run any R commands for this. [FWIW Internally it uses  
install.binaries to do this - that that works.]

The package installation/building of binaries is not optimal yet, we  
plan to work on that...

I'm not sure why the src install is slow for you - how much RAM do  
you have? The doc generation tends to use huge amounts of memory and  
swaps a lot on low-mem systems...

Simon

Indeed I use a dual G4 and single G5, so I didn't quite notice, but  
now I ran some profiling and found the problem - it's in fact not the  
highlighting, but the function scan - i.e. the process that builds  
the function list in the toolbar. Both - syntax highlighting and  
function scan could be optimized... It will be available in the  
nightly build in the near future - I'll drop you a line when it's ready.

Please try the current nightly build (1452) from http:// 
www.rosuda.org/R/nightly/
It features an optimized version of syntax highlighting that does  
till-the-end-rescan only for multi-line strings. Please let me know  
whether it solves your problem. If it's still too slow, please remove  
all functions from the code (i.e. just replace "function" by let's  
say "funct.ion") as to see whether the function scanning is the  
problem or not.

on the suggestion that possibly the /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.a library  
was conflicting with the Mac OS X 10.4 version I removed the file,  
but got the same result. Installation of other packages seem to work  
fine.

Any suggestions?

George,

That looks just like my problem trying to install ProbForecastGOP  
from source. I'm using Mac OS X 10.4 & R-2.1.0 as well ? using the  
R.app 2.1. I do not have a solution, however.

Yeah, same thing happened to me. I eventually had to turn PNG support  
off for the time being. I suspect it has something to do with Apple's  
upgrading of all the image decoders.

There is - it conflicts with the system one (as the error message  
unmistakably tells you). For details see my post in response to the  
exactly same problem described by Bill - don't use unversioned png/ 
jpeg/... libraries in /usr/local! I don't know where you get them  
from, but they are bad. Use static libraries or correctly versioned  
dynamic ones. The CRAN release has no such problem because the  
libraries are properly versioned. The really clean solution is to  
switch to ImageIO framework, but that's not quite trivial.

Cheers,
Simon

Using ImageIO is trivial. Just mask /usr/local during configure/ 
build. Starting with Tiger,  nothing in there is needed any more.

He's gettin' 'em from the same place I am I'm guessing: the tarballs.  
It looks like blowing out my /usr/local and going back to the Panther  
g95 have solved all my problems for the time being. Its a shame Apple  
doesn't ship a modern libdb, but I'm guessing there's a licensing  
concern there.

Simon,

Thanks for such a speedy response. That seems to have done the job.

I really like the new layout and I had a thought for future versions.  
I use S4 functions a lot and the functions drop down could be  
improved if it included methods, generics and class definitions -  
perhaps with different colours?

Regards,

John

I have added a Tiger-specific entry to the Mac R Wiki - it discusses  
how to build R and some troubleshooting tips. Some of the topics were  
discussed here also. Feel free to contribute.

Assuming you use Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) or higher, remove the  
ancient /usr/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib - it's superfluous and only  
causes trouble (this was mentioned here before several times).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Clemens and Jacob,

Can we take this discussion off the R alias and maybe onto the R-SIG- 
Mac alias
(once we have pinpointed the issue)?

Clemens, you are producing the hist with something like 'hist(rnorm 
(100))"?

Jacob, what exactly did happen in your attempt? R-2.1.0 has a  
functioning R.app
and should work. We can update to the latest R.app later.

Please respond directly to me, that way its ok in German, I'll  
respond in English,
thanks,
Rob

It's an OS X message, nothing R.app can do about it. See the Console  
for details - those would be more useful (I would expect a Linux  
person to look there first and ignore the message ;)).

It's likely a problem with your setup, see below.

Delete your workspace (rm -f ~/.RData) - that should fix it - as the  
message tells you there is a problem while the workspace is restored.

Cheers,
Simon

BTW: Using R-SIG-Mac instead of R-devel for the update.package could  
be more helpful as this is Mac-only issue.

Hi Jari,

In addition to Simon's suggestion below, recently someone fixed this  
by ensuring
R.app has write permission to its working directory.

First, great job on the R 2.1 update.  However, I have a minor 
annoyance I'd like to bring up.

I like to set my background color to black in the application and the 
text to a light color.  Unfortunately, the cursor marking the insertion 
point stays black and I can't see it on the dark background.  I don't 
remember this happening in the previous version of the R GUI.

Message-ID: <345604FD-3C5F-40B5-A6B6-EB38074350EA@usgs.gov>

Hello,

I think there is a bug in the R.app (COCOA GUI v. 1.10) when loading  
history files. In the preferences there is an option to load history  
files by typing the name of the file. So instead of putting in here  
~/.Rhistory (I understand that would load the history file in the  
home directory) I use .Rhistory since I have several workspaces  
spread through my hard drive. However when dropping a directory  
directly into R.app or tipying 'open -a R.app mydirectory' IT ALWAYS  
loads ~/.Rhistory.  If you type loadhistory() things don't change.  
This DOES NOT happen if R is started from the terminal (the  
correct .Rhistory file is loaded always).

thanks,

Jorge

Thanks Jorge,

I'll look into that. Looks like it reads the history file before  
setting the working dir
(after drag&drop or open ...).

Message-ID: <a69590d89a88b247c2c23a37e7717805@pgrad.unimelb.edu.au>

I'm having a problem loading Tcl/Tk in R. Mac OS X, R 2.1.0, Tcl/Tk 
8.4.9. Tcl/Tk was installed from source in /usr/local/. When building 
Tk from source, the X11 static library could not be found, so 
-L/usr/X11R6/lib/" was added to the Makefile which solved the problem. 
Running X11, then R, typing Sys.putenv("DISPLAY"=":0") as suggested in 
the R for Mac FAQ and then trying to load Tcl/Tk produced the following 
error message:
 >  Sys.putenv("DISPLAY"=":0")
 > library(tcltk)
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... Error in fun(...) : this isn't a Tk 
applicationcouldn't connect to display ":0"
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

Error: .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'tcltk'
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'tcltk'

Does anyone have any suggestions about where I might be going wrong?

Sorry, if I am being thick.  I don't understand that.

As far as I can see the R config system adds '-L /usr/local lib' to  
the front of every link command regardless.  So it will always be  
searched for a library before any other location.

If I have no libjpeg in /usr/local/lib, the configure runs OK and says:

"R is now configured for powerpc-apple-darwin8.0.0

   Installation directory:    /Library/Frameworks

   Recommended packages:      yes

During the actual build '-ljpeg' only appears on the link line for R- 
X11.so, but the finished bundle has no links to a libjpeg:

In what way is ImageIO being used, and why was something in /usr/ 
local/lib needed before?

It's not quite true - the jpeg symbols in ImageIO start with __cg_ so  
they have to be remapped in order to get used. Moreove Apple didn't  
include the headers as they use it internally only. That's why I said  
it's not rivial (albeit possible ;)).

FWIW you can prevent it from doing so by using LDFLAGS= in configure  
- I mean really empty LDFLAGS such as in:
../R/configure LDFLAGS= --with-aqua ...
The same applies to CPPFLAGS
As a side note: R looks for fink and if found, its path is used  
instead of /usr/local

Chances are that you have a static libjpeg.a somewhere - that's the  
setup I use. If you can't find it, please send me your config.log -  
I'd be quite curious where it gets pulled from.

Anestis,

Trying this on R.app for R-2.1.0 following the hints on Simon's Wiki  
page:

* Installing *source* package 'BMA' ...
** libs
gfortran   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c fwleaps.f -o fwleaps.o
     npackage installation failed
** Removing '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.1.0/Resources/ 
library/BMA'
** Restoring previous '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.1.0/ 
Resources/library/BMA'


and in the console:

In file fwleaps.f:240

        sbs(curr)=cl(lb)
           1
Error: Array index at (1) must be of INTEGER type
In file fwleaps.f:255

        rss(curr)=rsret
           1
Error: Array index at (1) must be of INTEGER type
make: *** [fwleaps.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'BMA'

 From below output you have not updated the Fortran compiler, nor  
updated the
links as on the TigeR page of the Wiki (1st 2 sections, I did make a  
small update
to the page yesterday).

 From above output it seems the gcc-4 Fortran is more strict then  
g77. I believe
Stefano has compiled a binary for 2.1.0, but I guess that failed as  
well as the
package is kind of empty. I can have a look after this weekend.

Message-ID: <5C690C12-3B8E-450D-93E0-4EBD69E9B64B@stats.ox.ac.uk>

I am getting an error when I try to compile some C code in one of my  
projects.  I just upgraded my mini to Tiger and I installed R 2.1.0  
(with all the gui goodness) from the dmg on CRAN.  The installation  
seems to have created a link /usr/bin/R that points somewhere in the  
bowels of the R framework.  Anyway, when I use R CMD SHLIB in the  
terminal I get the following error:

Please read http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigeR
The CRAN build requires the use of binary packages on Tiger, because  
it's a Panther build and loosely speaking Xcode 2.x is incompatible  
with Xcode 1.x. Details are in the Wiki.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Kjell,

On Tiger, to compile source packages, there are some extra steps  
you'll have to take.
These are described on Simon's Wiki: http://wiki.urbanek.info/

Go to the TigeR page on the Wiki and follow the first 2 sections.

Below the versions of Makeconf and SHLIB I'm using.

Let me know if this works,
Rob

My thought entirely, I don't yet understand how the build picked up

You were right.  I discovered this late yesterday.

Let me know if there is anything that I can do at this end, thought I
would prefer not to have to modify the Fortran code unless I
absolutely have to, it is a modification of code written prior to
1972, and I am not a Fortran programmer,

cheers
Ian.

Um... I'm not sure what Rob can do here - basically you have two  
options:
1) use R from CRAN and switch to gcc3 and g77
or
2) make the package Fortran95 compliant

As of 1)
The R binary on CRAN was built on Panther using gcc3, so you need to  
switch your Tiger tools to use gcc3 and g77. You can do that as follows:
a) in Terminal run:
sudo gcc_select 3.3
b) get g77 from HPC pages ( http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ ) and install it
Now you should be able to compile the package.
One you're done, you can switch back to gcc 4 if desired with sudo  
gcc_select 4.0

As of 2)
Well, I'm not a Fortran programmer, either, so I can't help you with  
that one. You may ask some Fortran-savvy folks for help.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <2CE4F242-09D2-4C6E-85ED-FD07331E4433@bobobeach.com>

if one installs the R framework somewhere other than /Library or / 
System/Library, Makeconf needs a -F<path to the directory in which  
R.framework is installed> argument before the -framework R argument  
on the LIBR line. I'm not sure the best way to do that. Looks like  
adding the equivalent of -F${prefix} to the WANT_R_FRAMEWORK_TRUE  
line that sets LIBR would work, but there's probably a better way to  
set the framework path at configure time.

Should this go to r-devel or here?

Thanks,

R-sig-mac is ok.
And yes, we really need to set this at install time.
thanks for spotting.

Dear Simon,
I am using R from CRAN.
I am already set up for gcc3

[liontari:~] anestisa% sudo gcc_select 3.3
Password:
You are already using gcc version 3.3 as the default compiler.

I have g77 v.3.4

I have suppressed the -lcc-dynamic in MakeConf in etc

However here is what I get:

As discussed here last week (and in more detail on the Wiki), you  
need to make sure that your custom libraries in /usr/local don't  
conflict with the system ones - yours do. The two options are to  
remove the offending libtiff.dylib and use a static one, or fix the  
version/id of your libtiff.dylib.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <200505070902.j4792dXr005672@lira.anu.edu.au>

I have managed to compile R 2.1.0 on Tiger (with much thanks to all
on this list and Simon's Wiki), and so now I have a working R. My
initial problem at compile was the libjpeg/libpng/libtiff problem
described on the Wiki, and even applying the versioning fix listed
there didn't help. In the end, the fix that allowed a successful 
compile was to explicitly include -L/System/.../ImageIO/Resources
as the first LDFLAG (removing things from /usr/local/lib and /sw/lib
broke other things, like pdftex - and, yes, it would be better to
clean up entirely, but compiling R has turned into the job of the 
week). Now, when I update packages from source I get another problem;
e.g. updating foreign and then trying to load the library gave this
error:
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) : 
        unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
/library/foreign/libs/foreign.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/foreign/libs/foreign.
so, 6): Symbol not found: _libintl_dgettext
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/foreign/lib
s/foreign.so
  Expected in: flat namespace
Error: .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'foreign'
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'foreign'
 
Sad to say I am at a loss to understand what the problem is (except that
R can't find the referenced symbol in the .so file and I suppose doesn't
know where else to look). Any ideas/fixes would be very much appreciated!

Cheers,
Michael.

By the way, the current binary version of BMA on CRAN is 3.0 and does  
install
and work (if no conflicting libs in /usr/local).

Dear Simon, many thanks for the help.
I successfully managed to install BMA from source with your help.
I have renamed libjpeg.dylib and friends in /usr/local/lib as  
oldlibjpeg.dylib and friends.
I hope I didn't destroyed anythink by doing this, but now I can  
install sources with no problem.
Many thanks to you and Rob for the help
Best

Hi Michael,

Again, this is a consequence of picking up outdated libraries.
Stefano, Simon and I ran into this one (libintl) about a month ago.
libintl got introduced earlier on (with gettext) but is no longer  
needed.

For others on this mailing list, I would like to emphasize once more
that to build R and R.app on Tiger, with Xcode and X11 installed,
nothing is needed from either /usr/local or /sw **except ** gfortran as
indicated in the 1st item on the Wiki  ( http://wiki.urbanek.info/ 
index.cgi?TigeR ).

The only 2 other installs in /usr/local I've done are svn (to work on  
R.app)
and graphviz (2.2.1 in my case, for Rgraphviz).

To install/update source packages, make the changes outlined in the
2nd item on the TigeR Wiki.

*If* you can live with such a clean version of /usr/local, building R  
and
R.app on Tiger is a breeze.

Rob

Message-ID: <B2B26B0C-FB19-4B88-A15B-CA0E567DDEFD@r-project.org>

As mentioned here before, there is currently no Tiger binary of  
gfortran available that doesn't break on R sources. This is for  
various reasons, one of them being that most of them are based on gcc  
4.0.0 before the official release, which wasn't quite stable. Apple  
build 5018 is based on the gcc 4.0.0 release and works with R, but  
there was no binary - until now. You can find the binary of the whole  
gcc 4.0.0 Apple build 5018 now at
http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigerGCC
along with some explanations and notes.

Please note that the use of the binary is not officially supported! I  
have put up the page only for convenience of users that want to  
experiment a bit. We still support only the CRAN build which uses gcc  
3.3. When you use the above build, you're on your own. I don't see  
any immediate benefit of using gcc4 instead of gcc3 except for  
building G5-optimized or 64-bit versions of R... (which is useful  
only for very specialized applications).

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for the clarification, esp. as it relates to package sources.  
So, would re-installing the previous version of Xcode be the way to  
go, or just gcc 3.3? G5 optimizations & 64-bit codes are not an issue  
for me at this point.

Tiger (more precisely Xcode 2.0) comes by default with both gcc 3.3  
and gcc 4.0. You can switch between those using sudo gcc_select (i.e.  
sudo gcc_select 3.3 and sudo gcc_select 4.0 ) - no need to use old  
Xcode.

Does your build include the patch for the Alternate Entry Point bug  
(PR13082) which was committed to the FSF sources on 28 April (after  
the gcc-4.0.0 release)?  I have manually applied this patch to Apple  
code and it seems to work.

This is a very important patch.  Without it, although R will compile,  
a lot of Fortran code including Octave and possibly some R packages  
will not.

Hi Pelle,

Can you provide a bit m ore info? What version of R, Mac OS, R.app?
Is it a specific file you are trying to save? When did the problem  
happen?

Thanks,
Rob

Hello --

I'm trying to use the fastICA package on a G5 tower (dual 2GHz, 4Gig 
ram) and am continually running into memory allocation errors:

*** malloc: vm_allocate(size=844603392) failed (error code=3)
*** malloc[1272]: error: Can't allocate region
Error in fastICA(m, 10, method = "C", verbose = TRUE) :
         Calloc could not allocate (211149961 of 4) memory

I'm using R version 2.1.0

$ R --version
R 2.1.0 (2005-04-18).
...

and interfacing with R over TCP with Rserve v0.3-16 
(http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve/).

any advice on increasing the amount of memory R can allocate?  or is 
this a hard limit?

-Jon

The CRAN binary is 32-bit, so in theory R can allocate up to a bit  
below 4GB (AFAIR my test showed something around 3.5GB). Above R is  
asking for almost 1GB which is a lot given that it must be contiguous  
space in RAM so I bet you're simply running out of (non-fragmented)  
memory (that 1GB is just one object - who knows how many copies  
fastICA actually creates ...). You could run some profiling to see  
how much memory is really used - it could be even more than your 4GB ..

Although the error doesn't occur in Rserve, you should be aware that  
Rserve creates a serialized copy of transported objects, so you don't  
really want to transport all the 1GB back through TCP/IP ;).

Cheers,
Simon

Note that in 2.1.0, gc() now shows maximum allocation inside R since the 
last call to gc(reset=TRUE), so if the memory is being allocated by R 
(rather than direct C calls to malloc()) you can easily do this sort of 
profiling.

Message-ID: <76BFC51F-FB4D-439D-B557-055FE3900507@stat.ucla.edu>

I updated (in the first time in six months) the version of R in

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

It comes with over 700 pre-installed packages, about 500 have been
recompiled for Tiger. I am waiting for the new version of Bioconductor
and I will integrate. Also, some CRAN packages do not compile with
gfortran-4.0, and some non-CRAN packages have not been recompiled.
So some things do not work for sure.

This packages comes with Emacs.app in /Applications and with
gcc-4.0 and gfortran-4.0 in /usr/local. It also includes readline-5.0.

As I write this the upload is still going on. It will be done in about
an hour, the complete package is about 460MB.

Let me know if there are problems. Remember that this install
only works from the terminal or from emacs, not from RAqua or
from JGR.

There is some info on Simon's wiki, but the list is incomplete. Also,
the packages do not really "fail", because R-core does not ask  
authors to
comply with gfortran-4.0 language standards, and because gfortran-4.0
is far from bug-free and finished anyway. I'll be suggesting "fiixes"  
to the
package authors over the next few months.

Hi Sebastien,

With R-2.1.0 on Tiger I cannot reproduce the error.

If X11 is not started, it does produce an error message.

With X11 started, or if I switch the output to Quartz:

#        x11(width=width,height=height)            # line 23
         quartz(width=width,height=height)          # inserted line

the function works fine either way:

Unfortunately I don't have a Panther machine left to try it on Panther.
Do you get the same result if you swutch to Quartz?

Rob

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Disregard the following Unexpected crash
Message-ID: <80118a60e203e635ba81d9eff7fb97aa@umontreal.ca>

I am very sorry to bother you again.

I thing I was dealing with a corrupted file or something like that

Because when I copied the whole function into another file, and execute  
it it worked...

Thanks

It seems, that the installer changes file permissions on top level :

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app is closing unexpectedly
Message-ID: <42b8ca43795bec58f0a33daa718c0ee0@umontreal.ca>

To whom it may concern and willing to help!

I have put in this mail my R.crash.log
A copy of my own function
A copy of a call that you could use to recreate the crash

Because I am not good enough to dig out any information out of this  
crash report, I hope the following information might help.
1-  I have tried this progams in the console with sucess (but no graph  
is plot).
2- This routine was working in 2.0.1

Any information given A.S.A.P  would be more appreciated, but I do  
understand that you might be quite buzy...

So the crash occurs when the following function "altitude.filter.R"  is  
used :

If you have any idea on how to solve that issue I would be more than  
happy to receive them...

Thanks a lot

Tiger comes with Aqua Tcl/Tk included. Just compile with

configure --with-aqua --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

and it will automatically use the Aqua Tcl/Tk. Then load the tcltk
package, which I do automatically at R startup, and R will open
as a Terminal based Tcl/Tk application that has access to the Tcl/Tk  
eventloop
and will use that for interaction with Tk and with the Quartz device.

If this does not work, and you get the dreaded SetFrontProcess error
(you cannot interact with the graphics windows), go to
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec and say

sudo /Developer/Tools/Rez -t APPL Carbon.r -o R

and then it will work.

You'll have the Aqua Rcmdr (see attached), but since you dont have x11
support there will be no rgl.

The files you list are not even closely related to R. Since you  
posted the same on the JGR list complaining about its installer, I  
highly suspect it's your broken system. Please test on a clean system

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] minor problems with R 2.1 or recent R gui
Message-ID: <5B03363B-31FE-4FF0-94B4-1BC18B6BCDBA@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

I just got today's latest official release for Mac and I really like  
the small function syntax helper that appears at the bottom of the  
console window, thanks for the innovation, Stefano, Simon and whoever  
else helped. I also really like the unicode support in R 2.1. Gone  
are the problems with accented vowels, which I only succeeded to get  
some of the time before.

One small thing: in preferences there is an item called "console" but  
it is a bit of a deceiving title because if you change background  
color or transparency there, it does not just affect the console but  
also the editor windows.

Finally, I have a few questions. Since I switched to R 2.1 from 2.0  
some error messages have started happening. I think these relate to  
R, not to the gui, but I'm not sure because the gui changed at the  
same time.

My work has been pretty focused at trying to make maps in the last  
week, so I'm not sure if these error messages are restricted to this.

If I type this in the console:

library(PBSmapping)
data(worldLLhigh)
plotMap(worldLLhigh)

I get this after the last command:

 > plotMap(worldLLhigh)
2005-05-14 17:57:51.781 R[634] -[NSBigMutableString  
replaceCharactersInRange:withString:] called with nil argument. For  
apps linked on Tiger this will raise an exception. For earlier apps  
it will produce this one-time warning and continue with existing  
behavior (which is undefined).
Warning message:
gamma cannot be modified on this device in: par(args)
 >

The error message starting with "2005" and ending with "undefined)."  
shows up in red on my screen, and is the only kind of message in red  
I remember seeing on my console (default color settings). It happens  
almost every day now. And yes I also switched to Tiger about 1.5  
weeks ago.

As for the warning message about gamma, I get this many times a  
session when using Quartz graphics.

This brings a few more questions. In quartz graphics, I can plot text  
containing characters like the dagger (using the caracter palette to  
paste it into the text I want to plot). But when using pdf graphics,  
I get a dot (period) instead of the dagger.

On the other hand, if I put text containing superscript on a plot,  
like this:
text(y=47.5,x=-51.5, expression(0.04^b), cex=0.8)  # St. John's, Sick  
1965

the output is nice in pdf but in quartz, the superscript is way too  
far above the main text. I keep getting small differences between  
quartz and pdf, is there a compendium of known differences I could  
consult?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Hmisc still not available in binaries
Message-ID: <5C47EF0C-04C9-4C29-A853-509AA1DBBCA0@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

Many months ago I asked why Hmisc did not show up in binaries  
available for Mac on CRAN. I got answers about it not passing some of  
the tests, and someone (Stefano I think) said he'd look into it. In  
the mean time I had compiled it and the functions I needed did work,  
so there was no rush.

But now that I switched to R 2.1, to Tiger, and to a new Mac, I am no  
longer able to compile. The multiple versions of C available in my  
developer tools make me uncertain as to what fortran I should get,  
for one thing. So I'm taking the lazy way out, did someone compile  
Hmisc for R 2.1 and would be willing to send it to me? Last fall the  
author of Hmisc, Frank Harrell, seemed surprise his package did not  
compile on Mac and I think he'd help fix this if someone more  
knowledgeable than me told him where the problem lies.

Thanks,

Denis

Hi Denis,

To install the source version of Hmisc on CRAN, with the latest R/ 
R.app (R-2.1.0a.dmg)
installed, the only thing you need is to install the g77 v3.4 Fortran  
compiler. One of the many
improvements in this latest update is that R will select the right  
gcc for you on Panther and
Tiger.

As usual, the compiler is available from http://hpc.sourceforge.net .

With the above Fortran compiler installed, you should be able to  
install nearly all CRAN and
BioC packages from source, although it will be much faster to install  
the binaries whenever
available.

Correct. What would you like to see: 1) a note to let users know this  
or 2) the option to not use the
console background color or 3) a separate color selector for the  
editor background?

Same warning message here (or indeed an exception). I'll look into  
it. Thanks for pointing it out.

Hi Rob,

To answer your question, my preference would be the 3rd option.  
Settings for colors, including background color and transparency, in  
the Console preferences should be for the console only. Similar  
settings could be added to the Editor preferences. I'd like to keep  
my console looking different from editor windows. But this is a lower  
priority for me than having an "undo" command that works as expected,  
instead of bringing my back several steps.

That was due to a a synch problem. The mirroring to CRAN start before I 
finished the upload of the .dmg file, so the very first release of .dmg 
on CRAN was broken (you should see a file of about 17MB instead of 
20.8MB).

But now everything is fine and since bioconductor.org/CRAN is mirrored 
from the main CRAN site, I can assure tha what0s currently on CRAN is 
the right file.

I've been too quick to see 2.1a on CRAN :)

Hi,
This is a simple feature request:

Task:                        clear the R.app console
Implementation:    control-K key combination and/or menu item

This is the same feature found in Terminal.app (in the "Scrollback"

Thanks for this consideration.

Message-ID: <764355086f624559f09af30a98fd41b9@smalltime.com>

Since upgrading to R 2.1.0, I've had trouble with the source() command 
in command line R.

When I source() a file, whether that file exists, is empty, or doesn't 
exist, the command runs for about a minute before returning control.  
When run in R GUI, source() returns immediately.  After the first slow 
source(), subsequent calls to source() return immediately.  There are 
no problems with other methods like dir() and read.delim().

Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

Thanks.

Sorry Simon.  I should have said:

Mac OS X version 10.3.9

R version 2.1.0 (2005-04-18).

I don't know how to get the locale.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] performance difference GUI vs. terminal
Message-ID: <428C7F57.7050900@fz-rossendorf.de>

hi all,

I upgraded today from 2.0 to 2.1.0a on my G5.
I'm using still mostly the command line interface to R, but of course
the GUI is attractive, too, and better access to the quartz() device is 
a big plus (I would of course say a BIG thank you to the people who are 
engaged in this).

but (as I already noted  under 2.0) there is a rather big difference in 
performance when initiating the same calculations in the GUI and the 
terminal, respectively.

for instance, in the GUI I get:

 > date(); sum <- 0; for (i in 1:1000000) sum <- sum+i; date()
[1] "Thu May 19 13:46:24 2005"
[1] "Thu May 19 13:46:36 2005"
 >
i.e. about 12 sec. runtime


and doing the same in the terminal yields:

 > date(); sum <- 0; for (i in 1:1000000) sum <- sum+i; date()
[1] "Thu May 19 13:47:39 2005"
[1] "Thu May 19 13:47:42 2005"
 >

i.e. about 3 sec.(sometimes 2, have not timed it more accurately as with 
'date') runtime


give and take a second, it runs a factor of approx. 4-5 faster. why is 
this? what I note is that the G5 apparently does heavily access the HD, 
when calculations are under way from within the GUI. I don't see any 
reason for this (lots of free RAM etc.).

Have I missed something on the mailing list?

best regards,

joerg

You are right. Closer look at the issue using your example reveals:

in the GUI (2.1.0a release):
 > system.time({ sum <- 0; for (i in 1:1000000) sum <- sum+i })
[1]  5.50  1.34 10.41  0.00  0.00

console:
 > system.time({ sum <- 0; for (i in 1:1000000) sum <- sum+i })
[1] 3.00 0.06 3.35 0.00 0.00

As you can see the CPU running the GUI is not spent in R but  
somewhere else. Basically it gives other applications and/or system  
too much time (the disk use you mentioned is simply some other  
application than R). I have now changed the GUI such that it won't  
call the event loop too often. The timings improved indeed:

GUI (r1545):
 > system.time({ sum <- 0; for (i in 1:1000000) sum <- sum+i })
[1] 3.15 0.09 3.52 0.00 0.00

It's still slightly slower, because I'm using single-CPU machine and  
it has to handle user events, but the difference it not as big.  
Please fetch tonight's nightly build (1545) to get this speed up and  
tell me whether it works for you.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,
could we add a pref checkbox? Like "Give cpu time to other processes 
during R calculations" yes/no which disables/enables R_ProcessEvent 
calls in eval().

I don't think we need it anymore, because R_ProcessEvents simply  
checks how much time elapsed since it ran the system loop and if it's  
less that a given time, it will just return (more precisely it  
doesn't even bother calling the REngine callback). Currently I set  
the threshold to 150ms which seems reasonable to me - i.e. the  
longest response time to a system event (except for signals) is a bit  
over 150ms.

We could make the window configurable, but I don't think making it  
bigger will have significant impact on the performance. I could make  
it even adaptive such that the window will increase during long  
periods of R activity, but again, I don't think it's really necessary  
(unless, of course, someone provides an example where it would make a  
difference).

Cheers,
Simon

Michael,

It does pick up the wrong xml library from /usr/local/lib. Some  background is
on Simon's Wiki page: http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigeR

You have to update the xml lib, or install Tiger and make sure the  older lib
version is not
found before the xml that comes with Tiger. Several other older  libraries do
interfere
with R-2.1.0 as well.

R-SIG-Mac <r-sig-mac@stat.math.ethz.ch> is a better alias to discuss  Mac
specific
issues.

Dear List,

I am unable to take a snapshot using the rgl package eg:

  rgl.clear()
  rgl.points(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000), color=heat.colors(1000),
size=2)
>   rgl.snapshot('test.png')
[1] "failed"

Same is true running R from Terminal or Cocoa GUI
Rgl 0.64-13 binary install from CRAN
libpng compiled from current source
I am running R 2.1.0a on OS X 10.3.9 on a Dual G5

Does anyone have any suggestions?  Many thanks,

Greg Jefferis.

Hi there.  Having just downloaded the nightly build of R.app, all was  
going well this morning.  However, I just started R again this  
afternoon, was met by the beach ball, and this crash report.

Interestingly, I downloaded the build of R.app again, copied it over  
the old one producing this, and all is fine again.... for now.  Hope  
the info is helpful.

Chris,

Try duplicating R.app (select the R.app in Applications and do  
Command-D).
Double click both versions and you have 2 completely separated  
versions of R.
You can drag/place the multiple icons in the dock.

Some issues will show up, e.g. it will use the history from the  
version that was closed
last, both copies will share preferences, etc.

I would be interested why you use this setup (I can think of a few  
reasons), but
would like to understand yours. If you can send these to me directly  
or to the R-SIG-Mac,
that would be appreciated.

Rob

FWIW: you can run multiple instances of R.app in the same way RAqua  
used to run multiple instances: using a shell script. The easiest way  
is something like:
cat > /Desktop/R.command
/Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R
[press Ctrl+D]

Now you can double-click the R.command icon on your desktop and it  
will spawn new instance of R.app every time you do so. (We don't test  
this setup, so your mileage may vary).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Help with Hmisc
Message-ID: <38373cc50505230437159a1df1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,
i am a new member. I'm trying to install package Hmisc_3.0-5 with R
2.1.0a in a Ibook 14'' with OSX 10.3.9, but this package doesn't work.
In fact if I try to install this package from Package Installer with
the Gui or from shell/line command i receive this error:
* Installing *source* package 'Hmisc' ...
** libs
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/SHLIB: line 1: make:
command not found
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'Hmisc'
** Removing '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.1.0/Resources/library/Hmisc'
** Restoring previous
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.1.0/Resources/library/Hmisc'

R-Gui say that the package is installed but doesn't work. I need this
package because Design package needs Hmisc as dependency.
Do you have an idea to solve the problem?
Thanks to all

Andrea

Message-ID: <1116855161.19463.25.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi All,

I am a new mac user and I have a PBook running tiger (OS 10.4.1). Can I
run R on tiger (and what version? R.app? other?)?

Additionally, how do I update R once a new version is out? do I need to
uninstall the old version and install the new one, or there is some
clever trick like the apt-get function for Debian?

Regards,

Federico Calboli

Andrea --

I installed this package from Harrell's web site at Vanderbilt.  Here are
my notes on how I did that:

-----------------

Installed Harrells Hmisc and Design packages (from source from his web
page at Vanderbilt)

   1. Before installing, had to fake a library directory to avoid
      "warnings" (which would probably not matter anyway), but here it
      is:

      Did this in /usr/local/lib/gcc:

      Script started on Fri Mar 11 08:54:29 2005

      local% sudo mkdir powerpc-apple-darwin6.8
      local% cd powerpc-apple-darwin6.8
      /usr/local/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin6.8
      local% sudo ln -s ../powerpc-apple-darwin6.6/3.4 3.4.2

      Script done on Fri Mar 11 08:56:18 2005

   2. Installed package by moving the *.tar.gz file to /tmp and then
      saying

      local% R CMD INSTALL /tmp/Hmisc_xxx.tar.gz

      Done!
-----------------

I think that I did get a few warnings during the compilation of Hmisc and
installation, but they have never seemed to make a difference and Hmisc
and Design are running fine.  By the way:

> version
         _
platform powerpc-apple-darwin6.8
arch     powerpc
os       darwin6.8
system   powerpc, darwin6.8

Yes, pretty much any version you want (although we recommend to use  
the latest one which is 2.1.0a for Mac OS X).

Currently there is no trick, you just install the new version and  
once you don't like the old one anymore, you can just delete it by  
moving /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.0 to trash (or  
whatever the version is you want to delete). Basically, you can run  
several R versions in parallel if you have a reason to do so, they co- 
exist well.

Cheers,
Simon

You don't have Xcode tools installed. You will need Xcode and g77  
fortran compiler - please consult the FAQ on how to obtain those tools.

Hi Volker,

Just tried this with 1 of the few packages I had not installed yet  
systemwide.

In the Startup preferences I selected to add $Home/R/Library and  
restarted R.

Then installed package its and loaded the library and ran the example.

Can you try if that sequence works for you?

A better alias for Mac questions is R-SIG-Mac.

Regards,
Rob

Hi Guillaume,

There is a R-SIG-Mac alias where many of these questions are being  
addressed.

The most likely reason is that you have a .RData file around that its  
trying to load.
It might be missing a library or trying to connect to X11.

Can you check for that 1st in a terminal window (ls -lia). Finder  
does not show .xxx files.
If you reply to me, we can take it from there or switch to R-Sig-Mac.

Rob

Hi everyone,

I was reading the R-OSX-wiki and it appears that I need to install f95
for Panther and not for Tiger... is the info up-to date? and does it
apply to R installed as R.app? incidentally, how would this affect other
applications using the fortran compiler (if in any way)?

If you download the gfortran 4.0 from Simon's website, it can
compile R just fine. Or if you compile your own from the apple- 
local-200502-branch
of anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcc. I don't know about
R.app.

rgl is X11 specific. The problem could come about because you use the
bundled Aqua OpenGL for the headers. You probably need an X11 OpenGL
installation. Since I don't use X11, I don't have rgl in my distro  
either.

The prebuilt version of R.app uses a R.framework configured to use g77  
and gcc3.3 as stated on Simon's Wiki page.
But you can build the R.framework yourself on Tiger following Simon's  
note.
R.app is not really concerned about the version of gcc/fortran used as  
it calls R to build and install packages.

Dear all,

Thanks for the reply, I solved the issue last night. It appears it is 
was a problem with quicktime library. When I installed Tiger, I dragged 
my Panther quicktime plugin and this was not a good idea. R did not work 
(whatever version) in GUI, but would work in the terminal. I restarted 
the machine and the R would work as GUI, with this error message (at 
least this one, and many times):

2005-05-24 18:42:25.919 R[316] CFLog (21): Error loading 
/Library/QuickTime/DivX 5.component/Contents/MacOS/DivX 5:  error code 
4, error number 0 (Library not loaded: /Library/Application 
Support/DivXNetworks/liblame3.92.dylib
   Referenced from: /Library/QuickTime/DivX 
5.component/Contents/MacOS/DivX 5
   Reason: image not found)

I installed DivX stuff and I now get only this message:

2005-05-25 09:16:31.332 R[4042] CFLog (21): Error loading 
/Library/QuickTime/LiveType.component/Contents/MacOS/LiveType:  error 
code 4, error number 0 (Library not loaded: 
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/LiveType.framework/Versions/A/LiveType
   Referenced from: 
/Library/QuickTime/LiveType.component/Contents/MacOS/LiveType
   Reason: image not found)

I suppose i will have to reinstall quicktime 7 and things will be OK. 
But I don't understand why R does need quicktime ??

Thanks
Guillaume

I am actually happy with R.app... I was more curious why f95 for Panther

Because that particular Tiger build is broken and segfaults on R  
sources.

Neither R nor R.app does. Chances are that you pretty much broke your  
Tiger, because all R.app does is to link Cocoa which links AppKit. On  
my Tiger machine it doesn't even touch QuickTime, so it must be your  
plugin or whatever you did to poor Tiger ;). Why don't you just  
remove /Library/Quicktime? It's not a part of Tiger. Tiger's  
QuickTime files are in /System/Library.

If you want to understand better who's loading what, set  
DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES when running R or R.app.

Cheers,
Simon

I can't seem to get R 2.1.0a to install BioC packages using the  
packages & data > package installer command.  The packages appear  
under both source and binary, but when I click to install a package,  
nothing happens.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I even tried the  
nightly build of the GUI, but nothing.

We've just posted the OS X binary packages to the Bioconductor website
(Stefano has been hard at work to create these packages).  And they
have not yet been announced as we haven't had a chance to fully test
them yet.

I believe that I experienced the same issue you are reporting: The
Bioc binary packages are visible, but selecting one or more packages
and clicking the Install button does not result in an installation
attempt.

I assure you this will be resolved in short order.  In the meantime, I
found the following to work and you can give it a try if you are
impatient to get the Bioc packages loaded ;-)

>From the drop-down box where Bioconductor binary repos is selected,
select the Other repository option where you enter your own URL of a
repository.  Then enter: http://www.bioconductor.org.  Check the
binary package checkbox and then get list.  You should see the same
list of packages, only now they should be installable.  YMMV.

Best,

+ seth

This is not related to Tiger but to R.app.
It seems like for BioC binaries  browse.pkgs is called by R.app instead 
of install.packages !
Until we fix this in R.app (I need to check the sources) the trick is 
to use
"other repository" + binary format
using

http://www.bioconductor.org

as URL.

You can find a working binary for gcc-4.0 with gfortran that will  
build a working R and Octave at http://www.swarm.org/wiki/ 
Swarm:_MacOS_X_binaries

This compiler was built from Apple sources with tag apple-gcc-5017.   
The Fortran components are updated from the gcc-4_0-branch of the cvs  
as at 19 May 2005.

You will probably need to set up environment variables CC, CXX and  
F77 to get configure scripts to recognise it.

Hello,

I've tried installing R-2.1.0a.dmg but after downloading it, the disk 
image fails to mount.  I've tried this on two different machines. 
I'm running Mac OSX 10.3.8.  I have been able to successfully install

Any suggestions?

Using ImageIO is trivial. Just mask /usr/local during configure/
build. Starting with Tiger,  nothing in there is needed any more.

Perhaps the file is corrupt at the mirror site you're using. I just

Even if you find it, it won't help unless you write a wrapper dylib,  
because the symbol names are different (they start with cg_). In  
addition, there are no header files for those private frameworks,  
either, so you won't be able to compile any code against it unless  
you make your own.

Cheers,
Simon

That apparently was the problem.  I downloaded the R-2.1.0a.dmg from 
the site that you used and it mounted successfully.  I had previously 
used ttp://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/ --this version may be corrupted.

Thanks for your help,

Hello all,

I'm having a bit of trouble with rgl, it loads okay and provides me  
with an image in my Apple X11 window, but whenever I go to manipulate  
it with my mouse it clears the image, the openGL rotation is  
preserved because I can create a new image and it will appear rotated  
to the degree I moved the mouse.

demo(rgl) is also playing up and may be the best way to see if the  
same thing happens on other machines.

It occurs in both binary and built from source versions of rgl

Have I overlooked something?


Tiger 4.1
R 2.1.0 patched
rgl 0.64-13

Seems that I misinterpreted the Kwiki advice totally.  So I've tried  
installing libpng
and libjpeg as suggested in Stefano's developer page.  Now in /usr/ 
local/lib I have:

yzzy: otool -L libpng.dylib
libpng.dylib:
         /usr/local/lib/libpng.3.dylib (compatibility version 3.0.0,  
current version 3.0.0)
         /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 1.2.2)
         /usr/lib/libmx.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 92.0.0)
         /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0,  
current version 88.0.0)

configure seems happy to report PNG support, but  in make I  get the  
conflict:

Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
         unable to load shared library '/Users/roger/Rinstall/R-devel/

I would be happy to follow the suggestion in the Kwiki to:

     use static libraries for libjpeg, libpng and friends

If only I knew how to implement it.  Sorry,  to be a bit dense about  
all this.

Please remove /usr/local/lib/libpng.dylib - it's just a softlink and  
it's causing the problem. The actual binary is libpng.3.dylib and  
using that is safe.

The underlying problem is the forced /usr/local/lib in  
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH which should be fixed soon (I hope to have some  
time for that next week ...).

Simply remove libpng*dylib - then the static one (libpng.a) will be  
used instead (assuming that you compiled both dynamic and static one  
- which should be the default afair).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problem with tab-completion of file names
Message-ID: <42968CE5.1030601@bifx.org>

I am running R 2.1.0a under Mac OS X 10.3.9.

First, thanks for the beautiful job on this release. Every release is 
easier to use and has more functionality.

In R 2.0.1, I discovered that I could use tab-completion in the editor 
(i.e., pressing the tab key expands incomplete directory and file names 
just as it does in the tcsh and bash shells). This greatly speeds using 
the setwd() command, for example.

However, in R 2.1.0a, tab-completion fills in the rest of the directory 
or file name, but the filled part is selected, and typing replaces the 
filled part, negating the usefulness of this feature.

For example, if I do this:

 > setwd( "/Users/chal<tab>

tab-completion fills in the rest of the directory name, giving

 > setwd( "/Users/challing

But the "ling" remains selected, so if I attempt to start the next 
directory by typing "/", I get

 > setwd( "/Users/chal/

instead of the desired

 > setwd( "/Users/challing/

easy ways to get static libpng, libjpeg, libtiff is using Gerben's i- 
installer
that also installs TeTeX and so on.

Message-ID: <E98C3775-9B95-4163-9188-3F4AB8E279BE@mail.la.utexas.edu>

When installing rgl from source, I get the following three warnings:

Any ideas about what the problem is, and how to fix it?

I am running R 2.1.0a on a iBook G3 with OS 10.4.1.

In 2.0.1 we used our own completion code that couldn't deal with  
multiple completions (basically there was no GUI except for the text  
itself). In 2.1.0 we have switched to the Cocoa native completion  
API, i.e. the one provided by Apple. The advantage is that we can now  
use multiple completion alternatives which can be selected from the  
drop-down list. The drawback is that we have no way of affecting the  
GUI behavior. (If someone has an idea how to remedy that, please  
contact me).

To prevent the selection from being deleted, just press the right  
cursor key before typing further text.

If someone donates some better way of implementing the completion UI,  
we'll gladly accept it, but currently there are no plans for  
alternatives (from my side, as there are a few more important changes  
I need to make first). If you find this behavior really annoying, I  
could make a preference setting allowing you to revert to the old  
behavior (without multiple completions)...

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <712DF59F-CF8C-437F-B314-871C0C902C2F@r-project.org>

Recently I saw quite a bunch of posts about rgl here. Daniel & co  
stated that the system is very modular, thus porting it to another  
platform is not hard (they have X11 and Windows modules so far). In  
theory it shouldn't be hard because the OpenGL framework uses cross- 
platform API, so all that is needed is to take care of the window  
creation and mouse handling. I would hope that there are enough  
people using Macs nowadays so a few of them should be familiar enough  
with C to give it a shot ... or am I wrong?

Cheers,
Simon

preemptive answer: No, I don't plan to do this, I'm busy enough with  
R.app and don't use rgl myself ;) ... it was just a thought ...

It is possible. I wrote a carbon backend which runs fine - sadly, i got 
a complete source tree crash before commiting the
port into cvs. I have relaunched the port.
Sorry to say, currently i'm very busy with other tasks and the current
source is in heavy development stage ... but if you'd like to have
sneak preview on the source tree

svn://neoscientists.org/rgl/trunk

you'll find the new stub of a future carbon port in src/osxgui.cpp -
the svn server is currently in beta-testing stage (its not the official 
one, but will become the new home)

Don't expect to find a complete carbon implementation - there is only 
the event-looping stuff , keyboard/mouse and dragging has not been 
(re)-written again.

Regards,

Daniel

Yes, this worked and I now have R 2.1.0 with both png and jpeg  
capabilities.

As an experiment I tried installing the X11 rgl from the mac  
binaries,  (Source
installation fails for me with an error on the int* to GLint*  
conversion that others have
mentioned as generating  only a warning.)  The binary rgl does work  
up to a point,
e.g. example(rgl) produces the volcano, but mouse movement to rotate the
image acts instead  like rgl.clear(), well, this is true for example 
(rgl), but for
the point cloud example(rgl.sphere) the mouse is able to rotate the  
cloud!
More theory obviously is needed.....

Gene,

On Tiger, using R-2.1.0a.dmg aws installs (binary from CRAN or source  
with g77v3.4), loads and
e.g. demo(awsdens) works fine.

How did you install it? It seems that you are using gfortran from  
gcc4 - I hope you re-compiled entire R using that compiler, otherwise  
you're bound to run into many problems. If you didn't, please read  
the FAQ - you cannot mix different compiler versions.

Cheers,
Simon

Few other folks did run into it as well. Try selecting another mirror  
and download it again.
Which mirrow are you using right now? I know Berkeley works.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app Crashes on Code Completion after long sessions
Message-ID: <BEC0E46B.583C%gsxej2@cam.ac.uk>

Dear R.app Developers / List,

I have been working some long sessions with R.app - presently the nightly
build v 1557.  I have had a slew of crashes over the last few days when
returning to a long running R session and accidentally trying to tab
complete a command line.  At this point R hangs and there appears to be a
certain amount of chundering.  The crash log suggests that the crash is
occurring after [NSTextView insertText:].  I'm sorry that I can't put my
finger on exactly what user operation is causing these crashes, but they are
somewhat frustrating and I wonder if anyone else has noticed this.

I have attached:
0) Version Info
1) a summary of my recent crashes (excluding those that I terminated myself)
2) Details of the thread that crashed for the 7 cases where the crash was
preceded by an insertText message
3) Full crash log of the most recent crash

I would be grateful for any suggestions.  Best,

Greg Jefferis.

Gregory,

please use the Debug version for reporting the crash log. Your logs  
seem to be incomplete, there is a lot of stacks missing. From the  
logs it seems there is no busy session, contrary to your description  
- but again this could be the missing log entries. Hopefully you get  
a full log with the debug version. (Please always include the full  
reports - you can send them directly to me).

Thanks,
Simon

Hi everyone,

and all is fine, but I get a tarball... Is it what I should get for OS
X? 

Regards,

Yes.

It works as documented so if you want to build a binary you just use  
build --binary. If you want to place a binary file in a repository,  
you should rename it to package_version.tgz, though.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Federico,

if you also want to "use" the package you need R CMD INSTALL or 
install.packages() from inside R.
