Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]trouble using R CMD
Message-ID: <a05101000b7de28980c4c@[163.1.41.69]>

-- 
I have recently begun using R 1.3.1 in Darwin/X11.  The Darwin I have 
is that which came with Mac OS 10.0.4.

My first experience with trying to use R CMD has not been a success. 
I am trying to index a package from its documentation, in the 
standard way:

[Localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $R_HOME
/usr/local/lib/R
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $PATH
/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/Users/david/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $PERL5LIB
/sw/lib/perl5
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $PERLLIB
PERLLIB: Undefined variable.
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% which R
/usr/local/bin/R
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% which perl
/usr/bin/perl
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% R CMD Rdindex ~/relimp/man/*.Rd > INDEX
/usr/local/lib/R/bin/Rcmd: command not found: Rdindex [37]
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% pwd
/usr/local/lib/R/bin
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% ls
BATCH      LINK       Rcmd       Rdconv     SHLIB      help
COMPILE    R          Rcmd~      Rdiff      Sd2Rd      libR.dylib
INDEX      R.bin      Rd2dvi     Rdindex    build      libtool
INSTALL    REMOVE     Rd2txt     Rprof      check      pager

R CMD appears to be unable to find "Rdindex".  Can anyone suggest 
what might be wrong?

I have various other packages installed using fink (and the fact that 
PERL5LIB is set to /sw/lib/perl5 is a symptom of that).  Could that 
be the cause?

Thanks,
David

Did you compile your own ? We do not have this problem on our machines (I
dont think it has anything to do with PERLLIB or PERL5LIB).  Something 
seems
to be wrong with the PATH set in Rcmd. Put an echo in there and see what
happens. Also, is Rdindex set chmod +x ?

1) gc() or memory.profile()

2) Not well-defined in general, but for a matrix it is usually 8 bytes per
element for real, 4 for integer (plus a fairly small fixed overhead).

3) You don't.  R doesn't have single precision.  as.single() is just a
request that when the object is passed to .C or .Fortran it should be
converted to single precision.

That's actually my mistake. I have a /usr/local/bin/perl and
/usr/local/bin comes before /usr/bin in my path, so the R
configure scripts pick up that one. I'll fix it in future
builds, for the time being if you use my distributions
just do

ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl

If I edit a function in fix() and the function has a syntax error, I am
unable to recover the edit file on Macintosh the way I do on other
platforms. This is what I get:

> fix(newf)
Error in edit(name, file, editor) : An error occurred on line 5
 use a command like
 x <- edit()
 to recover
> newf <- edit()
Error in edit(name, file, editor) : unable to open file to read

Here, edit() opens an empty window instead of a window with the code from
the previous fix().

Any suggestions? Thanks!

you should use newf <- edit(newf)

or again fix(newf)

I hope this helps you.

On the contrary I discovered a bug with the edit window I'm about to fix.
This is linked to the displaying of help files.

If you have an object that somewhere contains a "_", the edit window 
will remove it.

No this does not solve your problem. I'll try to see what's going on. 
Thanks for spotting this Peter.

At least under OS 8.6, the lwd parameter isn't functional in plot(),
par(), or lines(); it would be useful to have this fixed.

The same is true on OS X. It does work in the pdf() device, however. It
seems to just be the display device that has problems.

At http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/builds you will find the latest builds of
R-patched and R-devel for OS X 10.1. Both use the latest libraries
from Fink, in particular both use a new version of Atlas, fine-tuned
for 10.1.

The main differences between R-patched and R-devel are

1. The differences in  the versions of R, obviously. These are
      substantial.
2. R-devel is compiled with g77 and not with f2c. I assume this
     makes it somewhat faster.
3. R-devel is linked using the new two-level namespace feature of the
     OS X 10.1 linker. Again, this supposedly makes it faster.

If you want to use R-patched as your default R, then copy the whole
directory to your machine and run a "sudo make install" in the
directory. This will put everything in /usr/local.

I don't think it is a good idea to use R-devel as the default R. Just
copy the directory and run  the R script in bin if you want to live
dangerously. Observe that R-devel does not include packages
outside the base -- you have to install them, and you cannot use
the install.packages() function.

so these dates are changing, although they are 4 years early (I think the
mac date starts from 1904 now that I think about it). Is there any way to
get the correct creation/modification date of a file? date() does work, so
perhaps the routine already exists.

2)
The second thing is a very minor annoyance which puzzles me.  If I start a
new R session and type
>sapply(1:1000,print(letters))
... loads of output
>q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n

i.e. don't save it takes 5min and 30 seconds to quit.  My machine is running
a 400MHz G4.  I have given R a preferred memory allowance of 75000kb.  If it
isn't saving, what's it doing for those 5 mins?  When I'm writing code, I
tend just paste it into the R console from Alpha and consequently after a
long session the console history can get pretty large.

Many thanks for any insights,

Greg.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]trouble using R CMD
Message-ID: <a05101000b7de28980c4c@[163.1.41.69]>

-- 
I have recently begun using R 1.3.1 in Darwin/X11.  The Darwin I have 
is that which came with Mac OS 10.0.4.

My first experience with trying to use R CMD has not been a success. 
I am trying to index a package from its documentation, in the 
standard way:

[Localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $R_HOME
/usr/local/lib/R
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $PATH
/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/Users/david/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $PERL5LIB
/sw/lib/perl5
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% echo $PERLLIB
PERLLIB: Undefined variable.
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% which R
/usr/local/bin/R
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% which perl
/usr/bin/perl
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% R CMD Rdindex ~/relimp/man/*.Rd > INDEX
/usr/local/lib/R/bin/Rcmd: command not found: Rdindex [37]
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% pwd
/usr/local/lib/R/bin
[localhost:lib/R/bin] david% ls
BATCH      LINK       Rcmd       Rdconv     SHLIB      help
COMPILE    R          Rcmd~      Rdiff      Sd2Rd      libR.dylib
INDEX      R.bin      Rd2dvi     Rdindex    build      libtool
INSTALL    REMOVE     Rd2txt     Rprof      check      pager

R CMD appears to be unable to find "Rdindex".  Can anyone suggest 
what might be wrong?

I have various other packages installed using fink (and the fact that 
PERL5LIB is set to /sw/lib/perl5 is a symptom of that).  Could that 
be the cause?

Thanks,
David

Did you compile your own ? We do not have this problem on our machines (I
dont think it has anything to do with PERLLIB or PERL5LIB).  Something 
seems
to be wrong with the PATH set in Rcmd. Put an echo in there and see what
happens. Also, is Rdindex set chmod +x ?

1) gc() or memory.profile()

2) Not well-defined in general, but for a matrix it is usually 8 bytes per
element for real, 4 for integer (plus a fairly small fixed overhead).

3) You don't.  R doesn't have single precision.  as.single() is just a
request that when the object is passed to .C or .Fortran it should be
converted to single precision.

That's actually my mistake. I have a /usr/local/bin/perl and
/usr/local/bin comes before /usr/bin in my path, so the R
configure scripts pick up that one. I'll fix it in future
builds, for the time being if you use my distributions
just do

ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl

If I edit a function in fix() and the function has a syntax error, I am
unable to recover the edit file on Macintosh the way I do on other
platforms. This is what I get:

> fix(newf)
Error in edit(name, file, editor) : An error occurred on line 5
 use a command like
 x <- edit()
 to recover
> newf <- edit()
Error in edit(name, file, editor) : unable to open file to read

Here, edit() opens an empty window instead of a window with the code from
the previous fix().

Any suggestions? Thanks!

you should use newf <- edit(newf)

or again fix(newf)

I hope this helps you.

On the contrary I discovered a bug with the edit window I'm about to fix.
This is linked to the displaying of help files.

If you have an object that somewhere contains a "_", the edit window 
will remove it.

No this does not solve your problem. I'll try to see what's going on.

The same is true on OS X. It does work in the pdf() device, however. It
seems to just be the display device that has problems.

At http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/builds you will find the latest builds of
R-patched and R-devel for OS X 10.1. Both use the latest libraries
from Fink, in particular both use a new version of Atlas, fine-tuned
for 10.1.

The main differences between R-patched and R-devel are

1. The differences in  the versions of R, obviously. These are
      substantial.
2. R-devel is compiled with g77 and not with f2c. I assume this
     makes it somewhat faster.
3. R-devel is linked using the new two-level namespace feature of the
     OS X 10.1 linker. Again, this supposedly makes it faster.

If you want to use R-patched as your default R, then copy the whole
directory to your machine and run a "sudo make install" in the
directory. This will put everything in /usr/local.

I don't think it is a good idea to use R-devel as the default R. Just
copy the directory and run  the R script in bin if you want to live
dangerously. Observe that R-devel does not include packages
outside the base -- you have to install them, and you cannot use
the install.packages() function.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]file.info and R can take a long time to quit
Message-ID: <B7F8D1B8.2BFF%jefferis@stanford.edu>

Dear Mac R users,

I had a couple of questions.  I am using R v1.3.1 on MacOS 9.1

1) file.info() gives wrong date

fname<-"veryunlikelyname.1234"
tfile<-file(fname,"w")
cat("abdc",file=tfile)
close(tfile)
file.info(fname)

...  # wait a few seconds

tfile<-file(fname,"w")
cat("abdc",file=tfile,append=T)
close(tfile)
file.info(fname)
unlink(fname)

Gives:
> file.info(fname)  # the first time:
                     size isdir mode               mtime
veryunlikelyname.1234    4 FALSE      1997-09-16 12:50:54
                                    ctime
veryunlikelyname.1234 1997-09-16 12:50:54
                                    atime

> file.info(fname)  # the second time:

                      size isdir mode               mtime
veryunlikelyname.1234    4 FALSE      1997-09-16 12:51:12
                                    ctime
veryunlikelyname.1234 1997-09-16 12:50:54
                                    atime
veryunlikelyname.1234 1997-09-16 12:51:12

so these dates are changing, although they are 4 years early (I think the
mac date starts from 1904 now that I think about it). Is there any way to
get the correct creation/modification date of a file? date() does work, so
perhaps the routine already exists.

2)
The second thing is a very minor annoyance which puzzles me.  If I start a
new R session and type
>sapply(1:1000,print(letters))
... loads of output
>q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n

i.e. don't save it takes 5min and 30 seconds to quit.  My machine is running
a 400MHz G4.  I have given R a preferred memory allowance of 75000kb.  If it
isn't saving, what's it doing for those 5 mins?  When I'm writing code, I
tend just paste it into the R console from Alpha and consequently after a
long session the console history can get pretty large.

Many thanks for any insights,

Greg.
