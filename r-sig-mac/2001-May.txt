Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]building packages for mac
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0105031612360.13743-100000@gstat205.stat.wisc.edu>

Hi,

I have an R package written for a joint project. My collaborators in
forestry and botany use macs. I don't have mac access in my office, and my
collaborators are not terribly familiar with R. For short run, I am
wondering if someone here could compile the package for mac for us, we
would appriciate very much. For long run, I wold like to build this on my
own when I get access to mac in the lab. Is there documentations on how to
do this (just like Ripley's Rtools for windows)?

Thanks,

Jun

If

-- the package is organized in the usual way such that
    R CMD INSTALL foo.tar.gz
    will do the job

and

-- you want Darwin/X11

then just send me the stuff.

Conflict Catcher can't find the problem; even if I start up with just OS

Thanks for any suggestions!

Dear Peter,

I'm investigating on that. My actual suspect is that CarbonLib 1.2.5 has 
some incompatibility with system 8.6 even if it should not as the Apple 
doc says.

I'm trying to install an 8.6 machine to try to debug this problem. Have 
you the possibility to check how much stack R allocates. There is a 
general phrase in the CarbonLib docs that says: "on older systems your 
application  may require more stack". If you agree I can recompile R 
adding more stack to see if the problem is really the stack or something 
else. Let me know.

(Of course, in any sense, the best strategy is to update the System to 
9.1 even if it is quite "heavy" on old machines)

CarbonLib 1.2.5 also seems to solve various incompatibility problems 
if it's installed under Mac OS 9.0.4. This configuration is also, 
however, quite "heavy" compared to any 8.x option. In particular, 72 
Mb isn't going to be enough -- OS 9.x just barely runs under 64 Mb, 
and really 96 or 128 is necessary to do anything. But as I recall the 
memory footprint of 9.04 is a few Mb better than 9.1.

As for performance, just remember the two standard rules for a more 
responsive Mac OS system: turn off file sharing and virtual memory.

Message-ID: <20010508081046.B873@chanane.ucsf.edu>

Just wanted to note that R builds successfully
using XFree86 from http://mrcla.com/XonX/ .
(Thanks to tips from Jan on how to build loadable
shared libraries using Apple's version of gcc.)
I just got Xtools from Tenon, and the version built
using XFree86 ran perfectly. It would be worth
checking that a binary compiled using Xtools ran
for somewone using XFree86 as well. (I don't see why
it shouldn't.)

Has anyone heard about a pdf graphics driver under
development for R?

I have put a patch that will be available tomorrow on CRAN or can be 
found directly at

http://www.eco-dip.unimi.it/R/cran/base/8.6_patch


This patch is needed only by System 8.6 users that experiments a System 
Error 3.

This patch only fixes a problem with a function call that is not 
available under MacOS System 8.6.  No other bugs have been fixed.

In any case you should download the original rm123.sit archive at CRAN 
and then substitute the file "R" (that is the R application) with the 
one you find in the patched archive.

If you experiment any other problem, please let me know and they will be 
fixed in release 1.3.0

The pdf device will be available in version 1.3.0 of R. The R-devel 
version contains a working implementation (thanks to B. Ripley).

I was thinking of writing a quartz device that can be used under MacOS X 
(with or without carbon) based on this pdf device. I think that this is 
almost straightforward but cannot be interactive.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]compiling fortran code of contributed packages using absoft f77
 and lnk
Message-ID: <p05001900b737f00902de@[129.132.80.97]>

DeaR mac users

I tried to compile the fortran code of the "splancs" package using 
Absoft's Fortran compiler f77 and combine the object files into a 
shared library using Absoft's lnk. I could create the library without 
any problem but
when I tried to access the library from R strange things happen.

I can load the modules contained in the library by the R's dyn.load().

But when I check whether a particular Fortran routine, say "areapl", 
is accessible to R by using
>  is.loaded(symbol.For("areapl"))
[1] FALSE
>

Strange enough if I test
>  is.loaded(symbol.C("areapl"))
[1] TRUE

I get the answer that areapl is accessible as a C module.
>From this I conclude that lnk gives the shared library some attribute 
which makes R think that the library contains C code.

For contributed packages containing C code I did not experience any 
problems, ie. acc and lnk created a shared library accessible to R 
(e.g. I could install geoR, available from 
http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~ribeiro/geoR.html, on my G4).

Now my question is: how can I control that lnk creates a shared 
library consisting of FORTRAN routines. Does anybody have a hint?

I suspect that the absoft compiler do not user "underlines" in the 
function names. R for MacOS actually add a "_" symbol to fortran 
functions. This is because Mac f2c uses this convention.

Can you please try to do this witht he absoft compiler ? I do not own 
this compiler but it would be very important to understand what is going 
on.

yes, this is because also printing has the same resolution of macintosh=20=

I ran into this same problem using the Absoft windows compiler. Absoft
Tech Support and Brian Ripley were both very helpful. After you make sure
that you are consistent with upper and lower case, and with the trailing
underscore, use .C and not .Fortran. Here was Brian's solution:

Use .C for `Foreign' compilers.  That does no mapping.  I thought I
suggested that yesterday (and I did put it in readme.packages yesterday).

It is an option in Absoft's f77 to prepend a _ to common names.

Thanks to the hints I got, I could easily solve the problem with 
Absoft's Fortran compiler f77.

The option -N15 tells the compiler to add trailing underscores to any 
function and subroutine names. The Fortran routines can then be 
called by R's .Fortran().

Dear all -
Not sure if this is really a troublshooting list, but here goes.

Please reply to me, and to the list if folks think it is of general interest.

After running a simulation, I am trying to invoke a 2 row 1 column graph 
with par(mfrow=c(2,1))

This is followed by calling the two graphs where ngen is the number of reps 
the simulation has run and rt and at are vectors of length ngen

plot(c(1:ngen),at)
plot(c(1:ngen),rt)

I am getting a error message:

Error in plot.xy(xy,......: negative length vectors not allowed.

a check on the length of the vectors length() displays them as all 1000 
(ngen) and positive.

If i run the simulation without the par call, each plot prints separately.
If i run a different simulation, par works fine.

Any ideas?  (the code is below)

cheers,
andrew

This problem is a known bug of the macintosh() device. Usually by simply 
enlarging the window solves the problem of "negative length".

It is written in the Mac Faq and I'm trying to fix this too for the next

Hi,

I have an R package written for a joint project. My collaborators in
forestry and botany use macs. I don't have mac access in my office, and my
collaborators are not terribly familiar with R. For short run, I am
wondering if someone here could compile the package for mac for us, we

own when I get access to mac in the lab. Is there documentations on how to
do this (just like Ripley's Rtools for windows)?

Conflict Catcher can't find the problem; even if I start up with just OS

Dear Peter,

I'm investigating on that. My actual suspect is that CarbonLib 1.2.5 has 
some incompatibility with system 8.6 even if it should not as the Apple 
doc says.

I'm trying to install an 8.6 machine to try to debug this problem. Have 
you the possibility to check how much stack R allocates. There is a 
general phrase in the CarbonLib docs that says: "on older systems your 
application  may require more stack". If you agree I can recompile R 
adding more stack to see if the problem is really the stack or something 
else. Let me know.

(Of course, in any sense, the best strategy is to update the System to 
9.1 even if it is quite "heavy" on old machines)

Stefano

CarbonLib 1.2.5 also seems to solve various incompatibility problems 
if it's installed under Mac OS 9.0.4. This configuration is also, 
however, quite "heavy" compared to any 8.x option. In particular, 72 
Mb isn't going to be enough -- OS 9.x just barely runs under 64 Mb, 
and really 96 or 128 is necessary to do anything. But as I recall the 
memory footprint of 9.04 is a few Mb better than 9.1.

As for performance, just remember the two standard rules for a more 
responsive Mac OS system: turn off file sharing and virtual memory.

Just wanted to note that R builds successfully
using XFree86 from http://mrcla.com/XonX/ .
(Thanks to tips from Jan on how to build loadable
shared libraries using Apple's version of gcc.)
I just got Xtools from Tenon, and the version built
using XFree86 ran perfectly. It would be worth
checking that a binary compiled using Xtools ran
for somewone using XFree86 as well. (I don't see why
it shouldn't.)

Has anyone heard about a pdf graphics driver under
development for R?

I have put a patch that will be available tomorrow on CRAN or can be 
found directly at

http://www.eco-dip.unimi.it/R/cran/base/8.6_patch


This patch is needed only by System 8.6 users that experiments a System 
Error 3.

This patch only fixes a problem with a function call that is not 
available under MacOS System 8.6.  No other bugs have been fixed.

In any case you should download the original rm123.sit archive at CRAN 
and then substitute the file "R" (that is the R application) with the 
one you find in the patched archive.

If you experiment any other problem, please let me know and they will be 
fixed in release 1.3.0

The pdf device will be available in version 1.3.0 of R. The R-devel 
version contains a working implementation (thanks to B. Ripley).

I was thinking of writing a quartz device that can be used under MacOS X 
(with or without carbon) based on this pdf device. I think that this is 
almost straightforward but cannot be interactive.

a graphics is printed out, independent of if I press the button

(2) Using the menu again for printing out, a light gray background

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]compiling fortran code of contributed packages using absoft f77
 and lnk
Message-ID: <p05001900b737f00902de@[129.132.80.97]>

DeaR mac users

I tried to compile the fortran code of the "splancs" package using 
Absoft's Fortran compiler f77 and combine the object files into a 
shared library using Absoft's lnk. I could create the library without 
any problem but
when I tried to access the library from R strange things happen.

I can load the modules contained in the library by the R's dyn.load().

But when I check whether a particular Fortran routine, say "areapl", 
is accessible to R by using
>  is.loaded(symbol.For("areapl"))
[1] FALSE
>

Strange enough if I test
>  is.loaded(symbol.C("areapl"))
[1] TRUE

I get the answer that areapl is accessible as a C module.
From this I conclude that lnk gives the shared library some attribute 
which makes R think that the library contains C code.

For contributed packages containing C code I did not experience any 
problems, ie. acc and lnk created a shared library accessible to R 
(e.g. I could install geoR, available from 
http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~ribeiro/geoR.html, on my G4).

Now my question is: how can I control that lnk creates a shared 
library consisting of FORTRAN routines. Does anybody have a hint?

I suspect that the absoft compiler do not user "underlines" in the 
function names. R for MacOS actually add a "_" symbol to fortran 
functions. This is because Mac f2c uses this convention.

Can you please try to do this witht he absoft compiler ? I do not own 
this compiler but it would be very important to understand what is going 
on.

yes, this is because also printing has the same resolution of macintosh=20=

I ran into this same problem using the Absoft windows compiler. Absoft
Tech Support and Brian Ripley were both very helpful. After you make sure
that you are consistent with upper and lower case, and with the trailing
underscore, use .C and not .Fortran. Here was Brian's solution:

Use .C for `Foreign' compilers.  That does no mapping.  I thought I
suggested that yesterday (and I did put it in readme.packages yesterday).

It is an option in Absoft's f77 to prepend a _ to common names.

Thanks to the hints I got, I could easily solve the problem with 
Absoft's Fortran compiler f77.

The option -N15 tells the compiler to add trailing underscores to any 
function and subroutine names. The Fortran routines can then be 
called by R's .Fortran().

Dear all -
Not sure if this is really a troublshooting list, but here goes.

Please reply to me, and to the list if folks think it is of general interest.

After running a simulation, I am trying to invoke a 2 row 1 column graph 
with par(mfrow=c(2,1))

This is followed by calling the two graphs where ngen is the number of reps 
the simulation has run and rt and at are vectors of length ngen

plot(c(1:ngen),at)
plot(c(1:ngen),rt)

I am getting a error message:

Error in plot.xy(xy,......: negative length vectors not allowed.

a check on the length of the vectors length() displays them as all 1000 
(ngen) and positive.

If i run the simulation without the par call, each plot prints separately.
If i run a different simulation, par works fine.

Any ideas?  (the code is below)

cheers,
andrew

This problem is a known bug of the macintosh() device. Usually by simply 
enlarging the window solves the problem of "negative length".

It is written in the Mac Faq and I'm trying to fix this too for the next 
release. Sorry about that.
