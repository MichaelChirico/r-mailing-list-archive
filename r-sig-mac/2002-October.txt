Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]R-1.6.0 for Darwin
Message-ID: <AF6ADB36-D87E-11D6-9339-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

I don't think it is necessary to put binary versions of the Darwin/X11
version on CRAN any more. The current sources compile without
problems on both Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.2, using either gcc/g77 2.95.2 or
gcc/g77 3.1, or f2c. It seems to me that
if you are using R from the command line, using X11, that you are
sophisticated enough to install the tools below. And, if you want
to install and upgrade R packages, you need these tools anyway.

Here is what you need. I will assume you use Jaguar (10.2), support for
10.1 will vanish rapidly. Also, do use gcc 3.1, it gives better and  
faster code
on Darwin (it's the default compiler anyway).

1. The Apple Developer Tools. Become an on-line member of the Apple
Developer Connection (for free) and then get the latest version of
the Developer Tools.

http://www.apple.com/developer

This gives you, in the Darwin layer, the gcc toolset,
and in the Aqua layer it gives you the ProjectBuilder toolset (which you
do not need for the Darwin/X11 version of R).

2. You have to install X11. A good introduction to this is

http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/index.php

You can install xfree86 using fink (see below), you can also install it  
using the
installer from

http://www.mrcla.com/XonX/

Instead of using the XDarwin interface that comes with this  
distribution, you
can (and probably should) use OroborusX, which provides and interface to
the rootless X server and a very Aqua-like window manager.

http://oroborosx.sourceforge.net/

3. You need the 10.2 version of fink, for readline, dlcompat, g77,  
ncurses, libpcre, libz,
libbz2, f2c if needed, tcltk, xfree86 if needed, atlas if needed, gnome  
if needed. Some of this
stuff (ncurses, tcl, libz) now also sits in /usr/lib, but the R  
configure scripts
will choose the fink version.

See http://fink.sourceforge.net
	in particular http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/jaguar.php

All the CRAN packages compile as well (although you may need
other pieces of fink such as MySQL or netcdf to get them going),
with the exception of Matrix and subselect, but a fix for those is
on its way.

Message-ID: <63B72542-D91F-11D6-8B94-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>

I've just uploaded to CRAN the latest binaries of Carbon R.

You'll be able to get it starting from tomorrow morning on the main 
CRAN site.

In this version R binaries also contain the whole set of recommended 
packages. So you'll not find a separate archive any longer.

What follow are the relevant changes to this release specific to the 
MacOS. I'll suggest you to try the workspace browser (see "Tools" menu) 
and, under OSX, the new quartz() device.

Contributed packages will follow shortly

Stefano

		Macintosh-specific changes to R
		===============================

rm160
=====

* new scripts to build packages: makeAdd, makeRcmd, makeBio
   all the makefiles have been moved to src/macintosh/makefiles
   folder
* implemented the Quartz device (when running under OSX only)
* brand new worskspace browser, see Tools menu
* added and/or fixed internally mkdir and rmdir. Now
   unlink(), dir.create() etc work correctly
* html help handled via applescript. More stable and
   almost browser independent
* improved applescript support
* implemented browseURL
* implemented tempdir and tempfile according to Unix/Windows
   behaviour
* Date arithmetic fails (PR#1819). This bug have been partially
   fixed. Arithmetic is fine now but there is still a problem
   with the TZ (Time Zone) settings.
* fixed a bug in Locator of Macintosh device. Now it is possible
   to interrupt it.
* From this version WasteLib 2.1x is required

Message-ID: <C5BF2F9B-D960-11D6-AD1D-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

I have build R-1.6.0 on Jaguar (actually on 10.2.2), using gcc 3.1
from Apple, g77 3.1 from fink, ATLAS from fink. It passes all
checks OK.

I also re-compiled the 233 packages listed below
with the same setup. I have NOT tested all these
packages in any detail. A tar.gz file with the whole /usr/local/lib/R
will be on ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu on Tuesday. It will NOT include
anything from fink (i.e. /sw) or Xfree86 (/usr/X11R6).

The problem with tkrplot is that the load command in tcl does not
seem to work (while it did work under 10.1). The problem with
ROracle, RSQLite, RQuantlib is that they need libraries which
I do not have. In Omegahat Perl from R and Python from R work,
the other way around I don't know. RXLisp does not compile any
more.

what builds

-- Everything from CRAN, including RMySQL, RmSQL, XML,
       rpvm, rsprng, RMpi, but not ROracle, RSQLite, RQuantlib
-- Lindsay packages rmutil, gnlm, stable, growthm repeated, event,

Message-ID: <Pine.SV4.3.96.1021007060425.26876B-100000@csm.Berkeley.EDU>

Hi All,

I successfully compiled R 1.6.0 for OS X 10.2.1 using the latest Apple
Developer Tools (gcc-3.1) and the latest (cvs) fink packages (g77-3.1,
zlib, pcre, atlas, etc..)  (with the help of Professor de Leeuw's posting
to this list). It passed all of the checks in "make check".  Compilation
with "configure --with-x" enables the use of the x11()  device, which
seems to work just fine with Orobosox.  The build compiled with "configure
--with-aqua" (either with or without "--without-x") has one problem: The
graphics device will start with quartz(), and it will display graphics
[using, say, demo(graphics)], but the window is not accessible to my mouse
(I can't move or resize the window or bring it to the foreground, etc..)
--- nor does the quartz window appear to register in the dock.

I also tried installing the build as RAqua (using the instructions in
src/modules/aqua). The R gui did start, but the window wouldn't respond to
my mouse or keyboard at all. I don't plan on using the R gui (I try to use
Emacs for everything), but I mention it because it might provide more
information to those who are working on this. 

My Mac is a Tibook 800mhz with 1GB RAM (latest model).

Thanks for any thoughts or advice y'all may have.

Best,

Jake

Hy Jake,

the problem with the quartz device is that it needs an event manager 
installed and this is why I've started writing the RAqua. I'm trying to 
work it out to let R run its own event manager alone without opening 
windows, etc,as it does RAqua. There's actually a proposal inside 
R-Core to change the interal R eventloop scheme. This will simplify 
things under MacOSX too.

The fact that RAqua run smoothly only on some machines it is still 
under investigation. Apparently is something related to the OSX finder 
which expects things to be in particular places.

The real problem is that apple is trying to convince all its developer 
to use its own IDE (Project Builder and Co.) that is far from being 
compatible with the R scripts and makefiles.

Well, I am not so sure about that. The other similar projects that I am
aware off (Python for OS X, Aqua Tcl/Tk, and Carbon Emacs --
all from their CVS versions) all use makefiles and the command
line. In fact ProjectBuilder can be used form the command line.
All three projects are integrated in the main CVS distribution,
no special OS X distribution.

Python builds Python.framework, which contains everything
normally installed in /usr/local, plus the applications
BuildApplet, PythonIDE, PythonLauncher, and IDLE.
.usr//local only has a link to the python application in
the framework.

Tcl/Tl builds the Tcl.framework and Tk.framework, plus
the Wish Shell application. AlphaTk in addition builds
the AlphaTk editor.

Emacs build a Carbon application using makefiles, and
the wraps that in a bundle (the usual emacs files
remain in /usr/local).

Alternatively (with different configure flags) these distos
can build X11 versions, and so on. So there are models
of Makefiles available -- unfortunately it will cost some
time to unravel them.

Umh, but Phython and Emacs both open their own windows and then use  
pipes eventually. I'm not sure about Aqua Tcl/tk, I'll have a look, but  
you say that it builds a shell app itself.

I'm not aware of any application that uses the standard I/O from the  
shell and opens its own windows, menus etc. I mean an application that  
after the parsing of argv[] uses printf/scanf.

The AquaInstall I provided is  intended to create a bundle (even if not  
apparently working).

PB can be used via shell but just to (i don't know how to say) "run" pb  
project files.

BTW, as far as I have understood, the term.app take control over any  
event, this means that if I install an event handler it simply does not  
receive any event but apple events, i.e. only iter process  
communications is available. The filtering of events is done by the  
term.app event handler.

I'll be happy if any of you around can figure out how solve the problem  
and I hope to have better explained where I'm actullay blocked.

Compiled with gcc 3,1. g77 3.1, ATLAS on OS X 10.2.2.
You will have to install the parts of fink that are needed
yourself.

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub or ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub has a new  
R-1.6.0.tar.gz
with updated versions of XML and some of the Bioconductor packages, and  
with
RQuantLib (with help from Luigi Ballabio I compiled quantlib 0.3.1a3

OS X -- unfortunately the dylib is about 30MB, larger than all of X11,

loading it into RQuantLib is a problem).

If you have problem with any of the packages, or need additional stuff
which is not available through fink, drop me an email.

Dear Mac specialists,
I am using R on mac os x- no problems,
but have started requiring it in a big class of biology students
who use macs with very diverse arrays of os's
os 9.0 (!) etcc...
they do not have access to the mac developers pages etc
what is the minimal update needed to make R work?
(In particular I am thinking of just Carbon 1.3
and R-1.5.1, do they work together,
the most frequent problem
they are having is a CarbonLib _var not found,
my guess is the need for an up to date Carbon,
but I don't know where to point them to for this
update.

Dear Susan,

the best thing is to use R 1.6.0 and the latest carbonlib.
In particular carbonlib 1.4 is a system requirement to run R.


have a look inside

rm160/doc/html/rmac-FAQ.html

there you'll find a link to the CarbonLib library at apple site or go 
directly to

http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120047

After some juggling with dynamic libraries and bundles and a lot of
manual intervention in both configure and make both tkrplot
and RXLisp (at least XLISP_STAT from R) now work on Jaguar.
They will be in the next R-1.6.0 tarball on gifi (on Monday).

Here is some RXLisp output. It shows that RXLisp handles R lists, can
handle prototypes, and send messages to them. Of course the last
message in the file also produces a plot.

New version on ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub. This one has gnome support  
again, and
some updated packages.

At some point, I'll write some instructions, but basically you need to

1. get Jaguar
2. get the Apple Developer Tools (July and August 2002 versions)
3. Install X11R6 from XonX
4. install fink (preferably the source version)
5. install g77, readline, gnome and whatever else you need from
fink (what you need is what R complains about it does not have)
6. unpack the R distribution in /usr/local/lib

Alternatively

6. install r-base from fink (this gives you fewer packages)

Hi:

I still have problems to install R 1.6. I have tried both ways.


1- With Fink:

I deleted the whole /sw directory, installed fink again and installed 
r-base. The following error prevents installation:

	checking for /sw/lib/tkConfig.sh... /sw/lib/tkConfig.sh
	./configure: /sw/lib/tclConfig.sh: No such file or directory
	make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
	### execution of (export failed, exit code 2
	Failed: compiling r-base-1.6.0-1 failed



2- Using Jan's instructions:

	http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub/R-1.6.0.tar.gz
	unpack the R distribution in /usr/local/lib
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R

Here I had the following error: ln: /usr/local/bin/R: No such file or directory

I then creatde the missing directories and the ln command went 
apparently fine. However I cannot launch R and get a "command not 
found error".


Any help would be greatly appreciated. I feel really stupid and find 
the learning curve of unix pretty steep!

Learning unix, and at the same time installing the Darwin version of 
R and doing the necessary customization of your unix environment, is 
a very challenging task. Don't be surprised you're having a hard 
time, anyone would. There are a lot of different pieces to the 
puzzle, and they all have to come together the right way.

Do
   fink install tcltk tcltk-dev tcltk-shlibs
and then try r-base again.

Actually, there are several other things from fink that R needs; Jan 
outlined the list of them recently on R-sig-mac. Here is my list--I 
am pretty sure it is complete

  i      atlas   3.4.1-1 Portably optimal linear algebra software.
  i      bzip2   1.0.2-1 Block-sorting file compressor
  i      dlcompat        20020929-1      Dynamic loading compatibility library
  i      gzip    1.2.4a-6        The gzip file compressor
  i      libjpeg 6b-5    JPEG image format handling library
  i      libjpeg-bin     6b-5    JPEG image format handling library
  i      libjpeg-shlibs  6b-5    JPEG image format handling library
  i      libpng  1.0.12-6        PNG image format handling library
  i      libpng-shlibs   1.0.12-6        PNG image format handling library
  i      ncurses 5.2-8   Full-screen ascii drawing library
  i      pcre    3.9-2   Perl Compatible Regular Expressions Library
  i      pcre-bin        3.9-2   Perl Compatible Regular Expressions Library
  i      pcre-shlibs     3.9-2   Perl Compatible Regular Expressions Library
  i      readline        4.3-5   Comfortable terminal input library
  i      readline-shlibs 4.3-5   Comfortable terminal input library
  i      tcltk   8.3.4-1 Tool Command Language and the Tk toolkit.
  i      tcltk-dev       8.3.4-1 Tool Command Language and the Tk toolkit.
  i      tcltk-shlibs    8.3.4-1 Tool Command Language and the Tk toolkit.

Atlas is optional, I'm pretty sure, and has some extra complications 
of its own, so I'd skip it for now. It also takes a very long time.

If you were installing R from source code, you would also need g77 from fink

  i      g77     3.1-20020420-2  GNU FORTRAN77 compiler.


If your OS X is 10.1.x, then you also need "libz" from fink, but not 
if it is OS X 10.2.

My fink list above is for 10.2; the version numbers will be different 
for 10.1.x. There might be slight name variations in the fink for 
10.1, for example, it might be "bzip" instead of "bzip2". I don't 
know that for sure, but I mention it as an example of the kind of 
thing to watch out for.

Exactly what did you type when you tried to launch R?
What directory were you in when you did it?  (type "pwd" if you're unsure)
(copying a few lines from your screen and pasting them into your 
email can be helpful)

Probably, the explanation for this error is that you have not added 
/usr/local/bin to your unix PATH environment variable. To find out, 
try starting R by typing the full path to R:
   /usr/local/bin/R

(note, for R installed by fink the full path to R is different: /sw/bin/R)

If R starts up, you will have verified a successful R installation. 
Your job then will be to learn how to customize, or adjust, you unix 
environment so that you can start R by just typing "R" instead of the 
full path.

To find out what your PATH is, type
   echo $PATH
or
   printenv PATH

You should get a list of locations separated by colons. To add 
/usr/local/bin to your PATH on a one-time basis, type
   setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
followed by
   rehash

Then try starting R by just typing "R". If it worked using the full 
path, at this point it should work with just the "R".
But this will not persist beyond your current session, nor will it 
take effect in other Terminal windows.

Any time you add a new application to any location in your PATH, you have type
   rehash
to let unix know there is something new there it should be aware of. 
I'm not certain that rehash is needed after a change to PATH, but to 
be safe, do it.

Even using Jan's instructions, you still need some of the things from 
fink in order for R to have full capability. For example, R can save 
graphics in PNG format, but not unless you have installed the png 
things from fink.

To extend the analogy, not only is it steep, but you are starting not 
at the beginning of the hill, but part-way up.

In most cases saying

fink install libfoo

will also install

libfoo-bin
libfoo-dev
libfoo-shlibs

if they exist as fink packages..

I agree  with Don that one has to learn a lot of pieces to become a Mac  
OS X
and Darwin person.

What can actually help quite a bit are two small O'Reilly books.

1. Learning Unix for Mac OS X  
(http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lunixmacosx/)
	Do this one first. This makes you a Unix geek.
2. Mac OS X for Unix geeks (http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mosxgeeks/)
	Then do this one. It explains fink, for instance.

Absolutely no reason to feel stupid -- some of us have been fortunate
to have worked on both MacOS and Unix simultaneously for a very long
time (because our servers were Suns and our desktops Mac). We
are obviously very happy with Mac OS X, but we have an unfair advantage.

Maybe this helps. Open the terminal application, then issue the  
following
commands

1. curl -f -L -P - -O http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub/R-1.6.0.tar.gz
2. sudo mv R-1.6.0.tar.gz /usr/local/lib
3. sudo tar zxvf  R-1.6.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local/lib
4. sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R
5. rehash
6. R

Isn't that completely intuitive ? If one of them goes wrong, let me

The REventLoop package works well on OS X, it seems, both with Gtk and
Tk. If I understand things correctly (1) it is not supposed to work  
with the
Carbon event loop yet, and (2) if I did then the quartz() graphics  
device
could be brought to the front even if R is started from the terminal,  
and (3)
I could use AquaTk instead of X11 tk.

My installation problem (under 10.2) was solved by

	fink install tcltk tcltk-dev tcltk-shlibs
	and then install r-base again.

I am really grateful to Don MacQueen and Jan de Leeuw for their 
tremendous help, and kind encouragements. It is fantastic to find 
people willing to spend time helping the community.

The only thing that worries me is that, considering my learning 
curve, it may take months to years before I may provide similar 
services to the community!

I just wanted to add my thanks to Jean-Pierre's.  It's great not only 
having access to the code, whether source or binary, and this 
excellent resource for troubleshooting.  By paying careful attention 
to the responses to Jean-Pierre's  questions, I was able to have a

Well, by asking the questions, you have already helped me!

I agree with Stefan: the thread with Jean-Pierre, Don and Jan proved a 
big help to me as well.  Thanks to that thread I was able to bootstrap 
my Mac into what I think is a working system (with OS-X 10.1.5, XDarwin, 
OroborOSX, etc.).  I can run the compiled version of R 1.6.0 just fine, 
but when I run R from a terminal session, executing demo(), I am getting 
version 1.4.1  (2002-01-30), in spite of latest fink update. Further, 
sometimes when I run it, output scrolls to the terminal window to a 
hilighted (END) followed by my cursor.  Is this normal?

Sorry for this; I'm trying, really I am...

Hi,
Thanks to recent threads here and a *lot* of help from Jan, I am 
learning how to set up my Mac (OS 10.1.5) to run R w/ XFree86.  I'm 
finking my way along a steep learning curve, have managed to get up to 
version 1.5.1-1 through fink update-all.

(1) fink list "r-*" reveals file r-atlas.  Should I install that in 
addition to r-base and r-recommended?

(2) I have been seeing "atlas" crop up in other places.  Does it have a 
special significance within Unix?

Thanks to you all.
Regards,
Dave Braden

ATLAS is a self-optimizing version of BLAS, the basic linear algebra
subroutines, which are the basic building blocks of much of the
linear algebra in R. Self-optimizing means that ATLAS, while
installing itself, does a large number of tests to find out
properties of your processor(s). It knows about Altivec (i.e.
it detects a G4) and it uses threading if it detects more than
one processor. It can make your linear algebra (solve, eigen,
and friends) much faster if R is linked with ATLAS instead
of the bundled BLAS.

Building ATLAS will take hours on most machines, but it is
well worth it.

r-atlas in fink will build a version of R linked with ATLAS, which
also sits in fink.

All binaries from CRAN and gifi are also linked with ATLAS, but
not necessarily an ATLAS optimized for your particular machine.

Let me take the opportunity to recommend everybody to upgrade
to 10.2 or even 10.2.1 -- it does make quite a bit of difference in
speed, and in the available tools, and everybody is now developing
for 10.2.

I am writing up step by step instructions in how to build and/or install
R on Darwin/X11. I am getting so many requests for assistance, it
just seems more efficient. And I should have done it long ago.

Groan.  10.2.x has some stability problems with Microsoft Office; I hear 
Entourage is having the most problems, which might be of concern to 
some; it is also having problems with Excel that Microsoft's Mac 
Business Unit is working hard to fix.  These are all problems that do 
not arise with 10.1.5.  I post this in case Excel, say, is important to 
one's use of the platform under consideration for a Jaguar install.

But heck, Jan, if you say so, I'll go ahead and do it. Just don't ask me 
to jump off a high building.

Hi,

I'm creating PDF files in R to insert into a PowerPoint presentation on 
my Mac, OS X 1.5, shortly to be OS X 2.  At first I was using R 1.5.0 on 
Solaris but found that the font, Helvetica, failed to display when the 
file was inserted into PowerPoint.  I had success when I created the PDF 
file in R 1.6.0 for MacOS (Mac OS X, not Darwin/X), but then when I 
added a dashed line to the graph, it failed to appear in PowerPoint.  I 
can live for the moment without the dashed line, but I wonder if I've 
misunderstood something about the use of pdf(), or maybe plot() or 
lines().

Thanks in advance,

Gerry

Try including
   encoding='AdobeStd'
in your pdf() call.

When I do that with R >= 1.5.1 on Solaris I get both the hyphens and 
Helvetica displayed when I import the pdf into PowerPoint (the Office 
X version).

-Don

I've had the missing hyphens problem with the Splus postscript device also.

Sorry, I kind of jumped from dashed lines to hyphens in text. The 
encoding='AdobeSTD' solved the hyphen problem for me.

But I just now did this little set of commands

>  pdf('tmp.pdf',encoding='AdobeStd')
>  plot(1:10,1:10)
>  lines(1:10,1:10,lty=2)
>  dev.off()

in R 1.6.0 on Solaris, and when I inserted tmp.pdf into PowerPoint X 
the dashed line was there, as was the text. Also looked ok when I 
used R 1.6.0 for Darwin/X.

Would not be the best way to use latex+pdfscreen and to forget this 
powerpoint?

I guess that micro$oft made a bad port of pdf (Adobe product) in 
powerpoint.

One way is to convert your pdf to a micro$ft format using 
graphicconverter for example and to discover it works perfectly ;-)
