Message-ID: <001d01c47a6b$6812d310$5b8001db@webgis>

Hello, Professor Bivand.

 Last year, I've asked how to call  maptools' internal functions, read.dbf
and write.dbf on R for Win.

 A couple months ago, unfortunately my PC's HDD was crushed and your mails
were gone.

 Could you tell me how to do this if possible?


 Best regards.

Sorry, I've remembered using namespace like this,
"maptools:::dbf.read("filename")".

Message-ID: <6.0.0.22.1.20040813090417.02249f70@postoffice.utas.edu.au>


Hello, does anyone know about "storing geometry in tables" using binary 
record types?  Manifold GIS 6.00 http://www.manifold.net supports the 
storage of drawing object (points, lines and areas) coordinates in tables - 
using a binary "Geometry" type.  Geometry can be stored in databases (or 
other tables supporting the binary Geom format such as .mdb).

These binary records can be accesed by SQL queries within Manifold

I.e. SELECT Geom(ID) AS [Geom], [Drawing].* FROM [Drawing];  results in
a table like:
<geom, area, branches: 1, coords: 10>	6	Area	1	10	-156.579937304075

These drawing objects can be reconstructed simply by importing or linking 
to the table.
This makes Manifold a very powerful tool for manipulating vector data on 
the fly.

Apparently there are "Geometry (SHP)" and "Geometry (WKB)" (well-known binary)
for ESRI geodatabases and OpenGIS respectively.  Does anyone know how to read
such binary records using generic tools, like R?

I can already read table data from Manifold projects using RODBC, extending 
this with
binary "Geometry in tables" could be very powerful.

Cheers, Mike.

One possibility is to install winbugs (and you don't need windows to do
so: you can install it in Linux with wine)
and use the package rbugs

winbugs implements CAR models

  I tried mucking about with WinBUGS under Wine on Linux earlier this 
year. Disaster.

  There were problems with some dialogs not working - this seems to be a 
known problem with applications using the toolkit that WinBUGS uses 
under Wine.

  Worse still, some of the examples didn't work. There was something 
really bad going on, something like rnorm() returning 0 for any value of 
mean or sd. Who knows what else could have been going wrong that wasn't 
as noticable?

  If there's a proper test suite for WinBUGS now then run it - several 
times - if you want to think about using it under Wine.

Thanks, this is very useful - though rbugs claims to be able to work with
wine - does anyone have less negative experience with wine? The other R
package (R2WinBUGS) looks Windows-centric. Returning to CAR models, has
anyone written code for exporting neighbour lists from spdep in GeoBUGS
format (that could be included in spdep, or in a separate package
depending on spdep and rbugs and/or R2WinBUGS)?

There was a question (as the original questioner noted) on the list some 
months ago about CAR by ML (essentially doing what S-Plus SpatialStats 
does)? Is this a general need? Should spdep do it (I've kept away from it 
because spdep was not intended to duplicate things already available in 
some implementation of S, rather to complement)? Has anybody any code that 
could be polished?

Thanks to the list for the suggestions to implement CAR models with 
WinBUGS.  I would
love to see spdep include implementations of CAR via ML in the future, even 
though S-Plus
has similar capabilities.  R has a much better price, especially when being 
used as a
teaching tool.

Does anyone have a well-documented data set and weights matrix for which 
authoritative results of CAR estimation exist - preferably for a single 
spatial parameter - that they would be willing to make available for 
trying this out?

Hi,
If I am not mistaken does'nt Kelly Pace have some code on his website
for fitting car models, also Jim le Sage's Spatial econometric tool box
has functions
that shouldn't be too hard to port from matlab using SparseM.

Hello everybody,

I would like to validate my data for working with CART
I need to now how to randomize eithter the ID column in my already existing data frame or how to create a randomized column of some 6800 intgers to fit it to my data frame. I did not understand the manual concerning the possibilities to random data, sorry.
Thanks a lot for your help!

Try ?sample at the command prompt. (Note the "replace" option.)

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] early rgdal example
Message-ID: <001201c488cb$8f86c7d0$398001db@webgis>

Hi.

 Timothy H. Keitt's web page for early rgdal had tutorial using DEM of
Madagascal?and its surroundings.

 I remembered this example was better than current rlogo examples because
gdal is originally used for geo-spatial data.

 However I couldn't find this "original " web page.

 Can I see this page again?


 Regards.

Unless someone has a copy, no. It isn't on sourceforge, as far as I can 
see. The underlying files were E020S10.*, the DEM being 54MB, so a bit big 
to distribute with the package. "Small file" and "remoe sensing" seem to 
be contradictory. Shall I add a new Madagascar page to the sourceforge 
page - since the page needs editing to add a link to Prof. Ripley's VC++ 
Windows binary of rgdal 

(http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/rgdal_0.2-7.zip) 

anyway?

By the way, has anybody tried to build Rmap against the VC++ gdal12.dll in 
Prof. Ripley's build of rgdal? Contact me for details of his approach.

Roger

Yes, I think the issue was size and Roger was right to not include a
54MB file in the package! I had it there originally simply because I
thought it was cool that you could easily display a 54MB file in R.
(GDAL is good at subsampling images.)

BTW, I can report a recent rgdal success. We've been working with global
MODIS 1/2 kilometer datasets which are huge. My student was using
ArcGrid, but it sputters and dies just thinking about files that large
(its amazing to me that someone can charge those prices for code that
can't catch out-of-memory exceptions!) Five lines of code in R was
enough to row-by-row multiply a few gigs of data. Took a couple of
minutes. Less time than restarting our lone XP box after ArcGIS took it
down.
