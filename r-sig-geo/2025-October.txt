Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Advanced QGIS: Spatial Analysis - livestream seminar
Message-ID: <aFYugU-_TDe1VIQpdJwQNw@geopod-ismtpd-3>

Hi everyone

Instats is excited to offer a 2-day seminar, Advanced QGIS: Spatial Analysis <https://instats.org/seminar/advanced-qgis-spatial-analysis>, running livestreaming Oct 28 ? 29 and led by Dr Nick Bearman from University College London. Tailored for PhD students, academics, and professional researchers with some prior GIS experience, this two half-day workshop pushes beyond the basics to equip you with sophisticated QGIS techniques for transforming spatial data into meaningful insights. You?ll revisit core GIS concepts before mastering spatial overlays, point-based access analysis, and the integration of diverse datasets?including greenspace layers, postal data, and XY coordinates?while learning how to aggregate results into compelling metrics. Blending theory with hands-on exercises, Dr Bearman will show you how to visualise geographical patterns, interrogate complex relationships, and critically assess spatial data solutions, ultimately enhancing the impact of your research.

Sign up today <https://instats.org/seminar/advanced-qgis-spatial-analysis> to secure your spot, and feel free to share this opportunity with colleagues and students who might benefit!


Best wishes
