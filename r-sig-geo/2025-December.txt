Without an example file (all the files making up the ESRI shapefile, at 
least *.shp, *.shx, *.dbf, preferably with *.prj), there is no way to 
establish anything.

Never refer to S4 slots using @ in workflows - geo$INSEE_COM has been 
sufficient now for 20 years.

sp2bnd is a function in R2BayesX and is strictly superfluous to this

This is the core of the question - why no warnings or errors?

Coercing to an sp-class is superfluous.

It is possible that the coordinate values of the polygons in geo2 differ 
here by a very small amount if the versions of GDAL used to install rgdal 
and sf differ, and also because sf's implementation for reading geometries 
is more modern and cleaner than that in rgdal (>20 years old).

Recent changes in spdep warn about observations with no neighbours, and 
about subgraphs. Please read the relevant vignette: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/vignettes/subgraphs.html

No-neighbour observations may be detected when apparently contiguous 
polygons are separated by >10mm (default value) if the input polygons are 
an sf object, otherwise sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), (so  the sp case is 
unchanged).

If you accept a neighbour object with subgraphs (probably no-neighbour 
observations), set zero.policy=TRUE in nb2mat. This may however cause 
problems later on.

I suggest rather avoiding sp, subsetting geo_sf, and using that object in 
poly2nb. You also need to check whether the polygons are planar or 
spherical, as this affects the default value of snap.

If you need to share data, do not attach to posts on this list, but rather 
raise an issue on https://github.com/r-spatial/spdep/issues/, where the 
data and code for a minimal reproducible example may be attached.

Hope this clarifies,

Roger

200% echo everything said by Dr. Bivand below.

In addition, I would focus on the error message:

Empty neighbor sets found (zero.policy: FALSE)


This is the thing you need to solve. Why are there locations without
neighbors? A "cheap way out" which we offer in ArcGIS Pro is to provide a
union of the neighbor sets using KNN and contiguity. This ensures that each
location has at minimum k number of neighbors. You can accomplish this like
the example below. *However*, I would consider the implications of using
distance metrics for polygons. See if what you're doing actually makes
sense conceptually.

library(spdep)

geo <- system.file("shapes/columbus.gpkg", package="spData") |>
  sf::st_read(quiet = TRUE) |>
  sf::st_geometry()

nb_contig <- poly2nb(geo)

# helper from sfdep for st_centroid() -> knearneigh() -> knn2nb()
nb_k1 <- sfdep::st_knn(geo)

union.nb(nb_contig, nb_k1)

I think the CRAN package sfislands tries to help solve the issue of

It does - see also https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2025-015/, so 
does the spdep vignette using distances between polygon boundaries, but 
the primary cause here may be the differences between rgdal/sp with an 
unknown version of GDAL (most likely much older) and sf also with an 
unknown version of GDAL (almost certainly later) in reading the 
coordinates from the ESRI shapefile.

Without access to the shapefile, I don't think that we can conclude that 
the resolution is not rather to use sf with a properly defined CRS (snap 
defaults differ a little in spdep now for planar and spherical 
coordinates), and examine the impact of slackening snap by a couple of 
centimetres.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Question: Registering and Sharing an Open-Access
 Analytical Tool
Message-ID: <120203c8-ef2a-41c2-9522-4a4ddb5f8bd4@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I hope this question fits within the scope of this group.
Imagine you?ve just finished building an analytical tool with potential 
scientific impact. The tool runs from an open-access web page and was 
developed in R, using several spatial data analysis packages, including 
shiny for the online interface.
How would you go about registering authorship of this tool so that it 
can be publicly shared and used by others, while ensuring proper credit? 
Some colleagues mentioned assigning a DOI via Zenodo or Figshare, but 
I?m not familiar with how that works. Would doing this later complicate 
publishing a methodological paper about the tool, since it would already 
have been ?published? or registered beforehand?
Thanks for any advice!

Provided your project is on GitHub, it's quite easy to integrate with
Zenodo and generate a DOI for each formal GitHub release:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content#issuing-a-persistent-identifier-for-your-repository-with-zenodo.
If your project isn't on GitHub, you could upload it yourself to
Zenodo to achieve the same result. This shouldn't have any
complications with future methodological papers about the tool. It
would be like publishing a preprint and then submitting a manuscript
to a journal. In fact, if you have a DOI for the code (Zenodo) and a
DOI for the publication (from a journal, e.g., JOSS), users would then
have the flexibility to cite one or both depending on how they
interacted with the project.

determined that this was just an isolated observation and we have decided

Hello, just  a friendly bump to anyone who maybe missed this earlier in the
month.

Please take a few minutes for the GDAL 2025 user survey to help focus GDAL
Sponsorship Program activities. Last year survey results triggered the
project to embark on the GDAL CLI Modernization effort, your opinions and
feedback really make a difference.

Linked to from this issue, and there's also a link to last year's results:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/13496

Cheers, Mike

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Integrated species distribution model
Message-ID: <CABkCotTU4f5YJsc4h285rbRkQevtNZUfcq4fo=9fsuMYu06E9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Apologies for cross-posting.

I am looking for an R package that can jointly model
detection/non-detection (occupancy) data and presence-only data within an
integrated species distribution modelling framework.
Are there any recommended packages or implementations for this type of
analysis?

Thank you!

Manuel

Check out PointedSDMs and RISDM. I haven?t read their details yet to know
exactly how they treat detection/non-detection data, but they seem relevant.

Cheers,
