Subject: [R-sig-Geo] New maintainer needed {sfdep}
Message-ID: <CAL3ufULh3TtXGo4sgdDtvKxCN8Tzyz9adJhbhDmz5BG_w2e5JQ@mail.gmail.com>

The R package {sfdep} which is a humble attempt at a "tidy" interface to
the mighty {spdep} needs a new maintainer. It is currently scheduled to be
archived on Feb 19th due to some notes
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_sfdep.html.

I am no longer able to maintain the package due to a conflict of interest.
I would greatly appreciate it if someone else would be willing to take over
the package.

If you are interested, please do let me know!

Thank you,

Josiah

I would encourage someone committed to raising their package maintenance skills to take over from Josiah.

I've created a PR https://github.com/JosiahParry/sfdep/pull/43 bringing the github repo into submittable shape, so if Josiah could check my updates and if OK submit, the person taking on maintenance would not have an immediate fire to extinguish - the PR contains check logs for R released and development passing OK now.

So if you (single, plural) feel curious, please give sfdep consideration. Josiah does have plenty of other R-relevant work in his current role, and does have a conflict of interest, as he said.

Thank you very much Roger! And thank you to the handful of folks who have
reached out.

For further context, I am happy to help out providing guidance and pull
request reviews but I am not able to actively contribute. I won?t leave you
all on your own! ?

Dear Geo and Jobs lists,

Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences is hiring a fully funded PhD student to work on housing market / policy. Spatial analysis will likely be highly relevant as part of the research activties.

The announcement is at https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/257054/phd-research-fellowship-in-housing-market-and-housing-policy.

Please ask questions to the folks listed in the announcement.

PS: I joined the mailing lists to post this email. I'll be off the mailing lists after this. So if you want to email me, email me directly because I won't see new emails on the mailing lists.

Yours sincerely,
Xianwen

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] How to create inward (shrinking) buffer zones with
 st_buffer()
Message-ID: <SA1PR15MB63976FD364A4C3AD2A58D8A5B0512@SA1PR15MB6397.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Dear community,

I am learning some basic geometry operation functions of sf package including st_buffer().

It seems there should be no wonder if I provide a negative value to the dist argument in st_buffer(), I should expect an inward/shrinking buffer zone (I also followed here: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/392505/can-i-use-r-to-do-a-buffer-inside-polygons-shrink-polygons-negative-buffer). However, it turn out to be as long as I provide a negative value, the output will be an empty geometry:

library(sf)
library(spDataLarge)
st_geometry(bristol_zones[1, ]) -> a    # a is the exemplary data set

> a
Geometry set for 1 feature
Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
Dimension:     XY
Bounding box:  xmin: -2.534502 ymin: 51.40487 xmax: -2.488435 ymax: 51.43478
Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84

Geometry type: POLYGON

So I would like to know if it is possible to create inward buffer zones with st_buffer()? If st_buffer() is not designed to perform this, what is the best alternative?

Thank you, and have a great start of the week!

Dear Xiang,

sure it is possible. I suggest using a CRS that is projected, e.g. 3857 
(Web Mercator), or turn off s2 geometry. If you turn off s2, then 
st_buffer() will interpret the dist parameter in degrees. Anyway, if you 
choose a small enough number, then you'll get a non-empty geometry.

Dear ?kos,

Thank you so much for your quick and detailed reply!
I did not know about Google s2geometry.io library before, but now I noticed its impact on the sf package.

Have a great one!

Dear Xiang,

I've not had a chance to try your code, but your example probably won't 
work with the CRS set to WGS84. The buffer will use the units of the 
coordinate system, so degrees, which will be far too large for the 
bristol_zones example.

Assuming bristol_zones are in the UK, you need to reproject to BNG - 27700.

Also I am not sure whether bristol_zones from spDataLarge are in sp or 
sf format.

Once those are addressed - I see no reason why the example in the Stack 
Exchange should work.

Best wishes,
Nick.

Hi Xiang,

As an alternative, you could just convert the polygon boundaries to lines,
buffer those lines, and remove them from the original polygons. I think
this will work regardless of your CRS/s2 settings, and you don't have to
worry about how the buffer function is handling negative distance
internally.

Example:
bristol_polys <- sf::st_read(
  "
https://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/json/eng/wards_by_lad/topo_E06000023.json
",
  crs = 'EPSG:4326'
) |> sf::st_transform(crs = 'EPSG:27700')
# Convert to polylines and buffer
buffered_lines <- sf::st_cast(bristol_polys, to = 'MULTILINESTRING') |>
  sf::st_make_valid() |>
  sf::st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(100, 'm')) |>
  sf::st_union()
# Remove the buffers from the polygons
shrunk_polygons <- sf::st_difference(x = bristol_polys, y = buffered_lines)

Best,
Nat

Dear Nick,

Thank you for your reply! And I agree with several points mentioned in your email, as the geographic coordinate system is not the best CRS to generate a buffer zone. According to the guide from previous replies to my question, I turned off the Google s2 geometry library by setting sf_use_s2(FALSE) then st_buffer() will interpret the dist argument in degrees.

Btw, as suggested by class(bristol_zones), it is an sf object.

Thank you and have a great start of the week!

Dear Nathaniel,

Thank you for suggesting a new (and more advanced) way to tackle this issue. Your solution is obviously with better flexibility. In particular I appreciate your explicit adoption of units::set_units() to remove ambiguity.
Thank you for the help!

You don't often get email from henry.spatial.analysis at gmail.com. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>
Hi Xiang,

As an alternative, you could just convert the polygon boundaries to lines, buffer those lines, and remove them from the original polygons. I think this will work regardless of your CRS/s2 settings, and you don't have to worry about how the buffer function is handling negative distance internally.

Example:
bristol_polys <- sf::st_read(
  "https://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/json/eng/wards_by_lad/topo_E06000023.json",
  crs = 'EPSG:4326'
) |> sf::st_transform(crs = 'EPSG:27700')
# Convert to polylines and buffer
buffered_lines <- sf::st_cast(bristol_polys, to = 'MULTILINESTRING') |>
  sf::st_make_valid() |>
  sf::st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(100, 'm')) |>
  sf::st_union()
# Remove the buffers from the polygons
shrunk_polygons <- sf::st_difference(x = bristol_polys, y = buffered_lines)

Yields:

Dear Xiang,

I've not had a chance to try your code, but your example probably won't
work with the CRS set to WGS84. The buffer will use the units of the
coordinate system, so degrees, which will be far too large for the
bristol_zones example.

Assuming bristol_zones are in the UK, you need to reproject to BNG - 27700.

Also I am not sure whether bristol_zones from spDataLarge are in sp or
sf format.

Once those are addressed - I see no reason why the example in the Stack
Exchange should work.

Best wishes,
Nick.

Message-ID: <CAKRQQ2RR92e2+oXac8=KpCDDMhr+f-aYmBN9u+AdhV6BGeRs0w@mail.gmail.com>

I am getting the same kind of error working with stplanr (using function
route_dodgr) as well as osmdata (using function osmdata_sf), which lets me
assume that the latter is the culprit. The error is "attempt to set index
2786142150/2786142150 in SET_STRING_ELT". The index number is a little
different, although in both instances, we are talking about a value in the
2 billion range.
The error message is not terribly illuminating. Does anyone know what is
causing it, and even better, how to work around it?

In the case of the osmdata function, I tried to download a road dataset for
a four-county region in the (SanFran) Bay Area. I have previously
successfully downloaded the OSM road network for a larger extent of the
same geography (albeit directly rather than using the osmdata package).

It sounds as if you might be using integers to index some vector. Integers
in R are 32 bit which are limited to a maximum value of 214783647 which is
actually reserved for NA values. Anything larger than that will overflow.

Hi,

in osmdata, osm_id is known to overflow integers, and indeed should always be represented as character: https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata/blob/a37c15268f764e57d4e0b77ee6da5fe4bc9ec3dd/R/get-osmdata-df.R#L75. Why character - would arithmetic on osm_id make sense?

With current osmdata 0.2.5, osmdata_sf() seems to return character osm_id at least for points. If this is another column, probably the same argument applies.

Checking the inputs to the failing function may show something, and traceback() after the error should show the name of the R function calling compiled code in stplanr.

Hope this helps,

Roger

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Unit of parameters in the expandBB argument
Message-ID: <SA1PR15MB63971EA0F4D11873C4A1965AB0582@SA1PR15MB6397.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Dear community,

I recently revisited the expandBB argument in the plot() function for sf objects. It conveys a numeric vector of length 4 to expand the default canvas (in the order of bottom, left, top, right) when drawing an sf object. A quick refresh is here:

https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-class#:~:text=to%20geographic%20data.-,expandBB,-%2C%20for%20example%2C%20can
[https://r.geocompx.org/images/cover.png]<https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-class#:~:text=to%20geographic%20data.-,expandBB,-%2C%20for%20example%2C%20can>

Prerequisites This is the first practical chapter of the book, and therefore it comes with some software requirements. You need access to a computer with a recent version of R installed (R 4.3.2...
r.geocompx.org

I am curious about the unit for the four values of the expandBB argument. In the help document, it only says the values are "fraction values to expand the bounding box with":

plot one or more attributes of an sf object on a map Plot sf object
r-spatial.github.io

However, it did not explicitly mention the unit adopted for the values.

My guess:
For the 1st and 3rd values in the argument, the unit is the height of the bounding box of the sf object; therefore a value of 0.2 expands (downward and upward, respectively) the canvas by 20% of the height of the bounding box.
For the 2nd and 4th values in the argument, the unit is the width of the bounding box of the sf object; therefore a value of 0.2 expands (leftward and rightward, respectively) the canvas by 20% of the width of the bounding box.

Is my understanding correct?

Thank you in advance!

Yes. It takes 4 values for each of the sides (bottom, left, top, right). 
You can use xlim and ylim to set the plot region in spatial coordinates.

The code is at: 
https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/blob/bd1940f68dd7607b7e9098ccc32c99e273c30a60/R/plot.R#L598-L611

based on the equivalent in sp: 
https://github.com/edzer/sp/blob/e60dedf3ff3d06d9ebd9d38818b072e4475758cf/R/Spatial-methods.R#L211-L226

and added in a commit 8 years ago: 
https://github.com/edzer/sp/commit/d65045951bfebf28fbd5d0ad56bfff3cb48d57a8.

So the units are implicitly those of sp::bbox() and sf::st_bbox().

That is, the *output* units are map units, expandBB are proportions, as 
in:

expBB = function(lim, expand) c(lim[1] - expand[1] * diff(lim), lim[2] + 
expand[2] * diff(lim))

called for example as: xlim <- expBB(bbox[1,], expandBB[c(2,4)]).

Yes. It takes 4 values for each of the sides (bottom, left, top, right).
You can use xlim and ylim to set the plot region in spatial coordinates.

Thank you, Prof. Bivand, for providing the rich background information!
Now I think I know the full meaning of expandBB argument and how it will be utilized.

Have a nice day!

So the units are implicitly those of sp::bbox() and sf::st_bbox().
