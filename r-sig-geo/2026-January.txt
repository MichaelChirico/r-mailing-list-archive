Dear all,
We would like to remind you about the upcoming online workshop Mastering Quarto CLI: From Authoring to Publishing, taking place on 5th?6th February.
 
This two-day course will take you through the complete Quarto workflow?from installation and Markdown fundamentals to advanced theming, multi-format publishing, and deployment. You will gain hands-on experience integrating R, Python, and Julia code in reproducible, professional-quality publications.
 
Whether you are new to Quarto or want to deepen your skills, this workshop will equip you with practical expertise to produce polished documents and interactive content efficiently.
 
Check it out: [ https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/intro-to-quarto/ ]( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/intro-to-quarto/ )

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Release of SITS version 1.5.4
Message-ID: <6583BEBA-1BC0-4E74-B447-9D4D783F9A7A@inpe.br>

Dear R-SIG-GEO

We are pleased to inform you that version 1.5.4 of ?sits? is available on CRAN. This package provides an end-to-end toolkit for land-use and land-cover classification using big Earth observation datasets. Advances in version 1.5.4 include support for spatiotemporal segmentation of data cubes using an extended version of the SNIC algorithm and performance optimisations for increased GPU efficiency. 

The online book describing the ?sits? package (https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/) has also been much updated. The package and the online book have benefited from a software review held under the guidance of the ROpenSci community, chaired by Mark Padgham. We appreciate the key contributions of reviewers: Lorena Abad (in memoriam), Michael Summer, Edzer Pebesma, Jakub Nowosad and Alex Leith. 

For those in our community interested in multilanguage interoperability of geospatial software, ?sits? 1.5.4 includes a Python API via a Python wrapper (https://github.com/e-sensing/pysits). There is no measurable impact on performance. 

Best regards
Gilberto
