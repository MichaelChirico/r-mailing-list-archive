Message-ID: <iGvd_2qVR7qCVOfDRhecEg@geopod-ismtpd-7>

Hi everyone

Instats is excited to offer a free 2-day conference, NSF at 75: Advancing Statistical Science for a Data-Driven World <https://instats.org/seminar/nsfa75-advancing-statistical-science-for>, livestreaming July 16?17 and jointly presented by the American Statistical Association and Instats. Celebrating 75 years of NSF support for transformative research, this conference brings together awardees, program officers, and disciplinary leaders who will showcase landmark advances in statistical methodology, highlight emerging priorities, and discuss why sustained federal investment is essential for both fundamental theory and real-world impact. Participants will gain an insider?s view of the value of NSF for science and society, and why proposed policy changes could threaten the vibrant research ecosystem NSF has long cultivated. Whether you are a researcher or policymaker, or simply someone who values the public good that flows from robust, well-funded science, this event offers insight into cutting-edge research funded by the NSF, as well as timely evidence, perspective, and dialogue on safeguarding the future of statistical science. 

Sign up today <https://instats.org/seminar/nsfa75-advancing-statistical-science-for> and please share this with colleagues and students who care about the next 75 years of data-driven discovery!


Best wishes
