Dear all,
We are pleased to offer the online course "LiDAR Data Analysis in R" from 9-11 June. This 12-hour course will provide you with the essential knowledge and hands-on experience in analysing LiDAR data for ecological research using R.
 
You will learn the principles of LiDAR technology, how to process and classify point clouds, and how to generate terrain and canopy models. The course also includes advanced techniques for extracting forest metrics and analyzing vegetation structure. By the end, you will be equipped with the skills to handle and analyze LiDAR data efficiently using the lidR package in R.
 
For more information, please visit: [ https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/lidar-r/ ]( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/lidar-r/ )
Best regards,Carlo
